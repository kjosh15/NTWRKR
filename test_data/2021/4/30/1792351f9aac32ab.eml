Kes,

I had us down for a zoom mtg now; in case the cal invite was messed up (or
in case Google stepped in with a hangout link over the zoom one) here it is
again:

https://zoom.us/j/97801888759?pwd=3DV1JBL3ZMZWpYSlUzU2czWGV1SXVNZz09

If you got held up, let me know when would be good to reschedule!

All best,
Josh
