Josh,

Thank you, please see responses below.


Yes, I confirm these are these are steps required:

1. Purchase the Shared Hosting Deluxe plan for $200.00 for the first year/$240.00 after that or $20.00 a month

2. Purchase a new SSL cert for $75/year- Correct or (2) Year $120.00

3. Transfer the files for my website from their current location to the new server space as per these instructions:
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/sharedhosting/360045412991
Correct unless you'd like to have our Advanced Support Team do it, then it is $100.00 per site move. 

4. Validate that the new location resolves correctly (w/ SSL) as per these instructions:
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/sharedhosting/204643190
^Correct you will be able to preview the site as well as get the SSL installed as soon as it is added and verified. 

5. Copy the DNS zone file entries into the new DNS zone file- Correct this will ensure any custom records are carried over. Please ensure you lower the TTL prior to any DNS changes to help it propagate faster. 

6. Activate the new location. - Really this is the DNS change. That makes it active in the new location/ on the new server. 


Additionally:


- is the Shared Hosting Deluxe plan charged monthly or annually? - You decide I quoted you at the monthly $20.00 cost prior and Pedro E. mentioned Annually which is $200.00 for the first year/$240.00 after that. 

- What is required to apply the new SSL cert?- You can see the KnowledgeBase article below.  
Once the new SSL is added and you get it verified, then it can be installed. Support can also help assist if you have any issues. https://mediatemple.net/community/products/sharedhosting/204404454/-ordering-a-standard-ssl-certificate-from-media-temple-#3

- Is there any time lag for any of the steps above? Yes, there can be some downtime when the DNS is finally switched from one IP to another. As the articles mention it is best to Lower the TTL first. Support can also help assist with this. 

- After I have confirmed everything is working correctly how do I activate the new location (step #6, above)? Contact Support once all has been migrated to the new server/working and then they can help walk you through the finial steps of the DNS change over. 

- Will this effect our enrollment with Workspace at all, and if so how? 
WorkSpace is through Google and usually tied to your DNS records. To make sure this stays active you will want to ensure the DNS records for this carry over to the new Server. So as long as you are copying over those custom DNS files, then it will just be the time it takes to propagate the IP change. 

Which again Support can help ensure this is carried over once you are ready to make the finial DNS switch. That way the TTL will propagate the changes as fast as possible. Otherwise without lowering TTL, you have to wait 24-48 hours for all to fully propagate. 

Please let me know if you have any other question or would like to move forward.

Best regards,
