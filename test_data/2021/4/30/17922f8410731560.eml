Hi Josh,

So sorry for the delay on my end, things have been really hectic on my end!
We just launched RC Together and invited people to sign up for beta use if
it's something their company would find useful! We got some pick up --
https://twitter.com/recursecenter/status/1385315820042166277!

Glad to hear that you're moving the company into this direction, I would
love to help as soon as you've signed some clients on board. Thank you so
much for pitching RC to these folks, that's wild! We've had a ton of
company in bound this past quarter and it has been intense!

Let's stay in touch.

Best,
Sonali

<br>
I hope this email finds you and yours safe and healthy; it&#39;s been a hel=
l of a year.<br>
<br>
Fortunately I&#39;m writing with good news as I&#39;m looking to learn more=
 about your placement services. My startup (<a href=3D"http://www.indigomet=
rics.com" target=3D"_blank">www.indigometrics.com</a>) needs to hire our se=
cond tech position. We&#39;re currently in the middle of getting our first =
raise, but we&#39;re profitable and want to get the interviews started.<br>
<br>
The position is fully remote although we favor GMT and EST. We need someone=
 who can get up to speed on AWS microservices, optimize/converting our exis=
ting codebase (Python backend / C# front end) to same while collaborating o=
n getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is an ability to =
be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep learning curves.<br>
<br>
The upside is that we&#39;re currently working on DE&amp;I with the biggest=
 construction firm in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 500 co=
mpanies on a separate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest that I know of. I=
f we get it we&#39;ll be helping create systemic, public accountability for=
 much if not most of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel like we&#39;d rea=
lly benefit from some more diverse representation in our team!!<br>
<br>
A year ago I wouldn&#39;t have expected to be here, but the shift to distri=
buted workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We&#39;re seeing appet=
ites increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sharp to join th=
e team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about your fee struc=
ture and how we could get started?<br>
<br>
Finally - how the hell are you?? It&#39;s been a long time, and a weird yea=
r. Let me know if you&#39;re game for a short call just to catch up some ti=
me!!<br>
<br>
All best,<br>
Josh<br></div>
