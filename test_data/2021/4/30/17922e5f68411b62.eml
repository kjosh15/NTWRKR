Josh

Switch over to my business email.

Thank you so much for reconnecting with me - I truly loved our conversation
and am thankful to count you as someone in my network and someone who is
willing to stay engaged.

I think what you are working on with Indigo Metrics is incredibly
interesting and having watched the info-video on the site, I understand
very clearly how you have built a very simple and streamlined, yet powerful
tool. I would love to play around in the sandbox if that's possible.

In terms of potential investors - alongside the deck, do you have a
soundbite or two that you can share with me with respect to the number
and/or type of clients you are working with thus far, what the run rate is
currently etc? There are a few potential leads that came to mind when we
were speaking and I have added to that list upon reflection.

Also - you want to raise $1.5m correct?

I would love to find a way to help you and to become involved once the
round formalises.

Lets keep talking!!

Morgan

Morgan,

Such a pleasure to reconnect yesterday; I'm thrilled to hear about the work
you're doing, and really really really appreciate your insights and advice
on Indigometrics! I've attached our overview deck, we've got a short video
at www.indigometrics.com, and if you like I'm happy to send you credentials
for our sandbox so you can kick the tires on the actual product.

If you know of a family office that might be interested we're keen to
connect, and in any case please do let me know if this is something you'd
be personally interested in. We've not finished structuring the pool of
investors yet (step 1: finalize the lead...) but I'd love to find some way
to have you involved.

Please do let me know if I can ever be of help to you or your ventures, and
I look forward to reconnecting soon!

All best wishes,
Josh
