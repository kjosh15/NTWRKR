Hey all! I wanted to send this over to give you an idea of how I'm thinking
through our growth as an all-remote team. A big influence has been GitLab -
they've the biggest all-remote company I know of, and I had the good
fortune to hear their founders speak on the topic. While I'm not suggesting
we lift their entire playbook (they have a big one, and/but they're a 1,500
person company!) I think there's a lot here we can use:

   - https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/

The good news is they suggest starting lean, emphasizing values, and
growing organically and equitably. A couple links I'd recommend:

   -
   https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-emergency-plan/
   -
   https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/
   - https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/building-culture/

There are some really good tips here - document everything, never take a
meeting without an agenda, emphasize supporting each other - but I'd love
to know what/if anything sticks out to anyone else as we grow. Note this
isn't an assigned task - this is just me sharing an invitation for input
and feedback!

All best,
Josh
