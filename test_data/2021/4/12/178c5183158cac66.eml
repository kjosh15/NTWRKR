With the Wharton Whitepaper and Bechtel HBR Case Study coming up I want to
make sure we can get as much of a bang for our buck as possible. I have a
few friends with lists of media contacts (and a few direct contacts of my
own), but figured I'd ask the team in case you know anyone.

We'd be looking for business press - magazine, TV, blogs, newspapers, etc.
Do you know anyone who writes, produces, records, interviews, edits, etc?

Thanks!
- J
