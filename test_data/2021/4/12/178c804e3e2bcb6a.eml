Love to innovate. Maybe we can chew on a couple of ideas. One is that paren=
ts are encouraged to -- they practically have to opt out OF -- tracking the=
ir kids and being constantly available. I'm pretty sure that changes childh=
ood completely -- you are never truly trusted to be resourceful and respons=
ible. You don't get to see what you're made of when there's always an adult=
 ready to assist or intervene. Is there some tech way to scale back the chi=
ld-assisting tech? Tech that maybe only grants you three times you can call=
 your parents each month, or three times you can activate your phone to tra=
ck your kid (like a genie only provides 3 wishes)? That way parents would b=
e more mindful and kids would have less constant oversight?
Other topics: How do we get more schools to do the Let Grow Project, where =
kids are given the homework assignment, "Go home and do something new, on y=
our own"? Here's a 2-minute video of how much it can change kids (and paren=
ts) for the better. Kids are so anxious and passive. This is a great, FREE =
way to start breaking that shell!
How do we reverse engineer the societal notion that all kids are easily hur=
t and go through life broken, and therefore that it is best/kindest/most ev=
olved to view childhood through the lens of psychology -- always worrying a=
bout and discussing their feelings? And having THEM discuss their feelings?=
 It seems like we are so focused on sensitivity and fragility that we are i=
gnoring standard-issue resilience boosters kids come with, like bravery, fo=
rtitude, ignoring some pain, finding something else to do or love or think =
about... The same way we're getting kids into yoga and "mindfulness" and su=
ch -- techniques that adults may need because they don't climb trees or pla=
y night tag anymore -- we are making them into therapist chow.=C2=A0
And do you want to write about Moxie with me? I'm pretty down on the idea t=
hat a fake playmate is any kind of teaching tool for the real world of inte=
racting. Maybe if a child has special needs and the parent can't be helping=
 them as much as they need help -- but for regular kids? Or am I a grump wh=
o would probably have grumbled about the first See-n-Say or Tickle Me Elmo?=

 hear what you're up to and to see if we can't innovate on something world =
