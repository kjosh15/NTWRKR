I could use some help doing some research and would like to ask Loreley to
do it. Specifically:

- L&D firms in the US (potential whitelabel partners),
- large co's focused on I&D (potential convening customers),
- large co's in trouble or who want to be cutting edge (potential customers=

Not sure what you've got on her plate yet. Thoughts?
