Hi Josh,

Apologies for not responding. I hadn't checked my mail in a while.

I would love to have a chat with you. We can set up a Google meet in order
to have a discussion and connect. I'm usually free after 6pm PST. And also
available on weekends. Let me know what works for you.

As to what I'm doing now. I'm a data analyst. I have strong SQL background
and I am an expert in slicing and dicing the data and creating dashboards.
I'm currently working for an ecommerce company in Pakistan. I'm also doing
my masters in parallel.

I have a strong background in data wrt studies. I have studied courses like
data warehousing, business intelligence, pattern recognition, data mining
etc.

I love data due to 3 main reasons.
1- I liked programming, but I wanted it to be a small part of my job. Not
all of it.
2- I love maths. And data science and analytics is all about it.
3- I love finding patterns and colours and making stories and exploring
things.

With data I get to do it all.
My current experience doesn't entail data mining/data science/AI. However
I'm keen to learn more and improve within the field.

I hope this helps you in understanding my direction wrt my career. Would
love to discuss if there is an opportunity to be explored.

Thanks,
Maham Umar.
