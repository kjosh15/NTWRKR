Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple Sales.

First I apologize for the error you are receiving at checkout. I can help assist with getting the correct Google WorkSpace Plan added for you. 

1.) Please just confirm which Google WorkSpace Plan you were looking at getting for your 5 users. Please confirm I have it correct for 5 users total, as you pay per user account. I see the domain name you wish to tie it to is indigometrics.com, please confirm this is correct as well.

2.) The Emails would need to be migrated using the Google WorkSpace Email Migration Tool. It is not something that is automatically done, you can use this helpful KnowledgeBase article for steps: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/googleapps/204645550/how-do-i-migrate-email-to-google-workspace

3.) The DMARC goes by the domain name/email user, so No. As long as you setup that same user as listed in the DMARC then it will still be valid. The SPF will get added when you do the point to Google WorkSpace, so really the only thing needed it the DKMI. 

There will be some down time while switching/updating the MX records to show Google instead of ours. However if you Lower the TTL prior to making the change, It will allow it to propagate faster. See more information here: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/googleapps/204643300/how-do-i-point-my-mail-to-google-workspace

4.) In looking at your current DNS/AWS settings. I do not see any reason why those would be messed with. The only thing Google WorkSpace will be replacing is (mt) Media Temple's MX/Mail record information. Nothing with any other DNS settings will be touched therefore the AWS setting will remain in tack. 

I hope I have answered all of your questions, please just confirm back to me the above information and I will get your new Google WorkSpace Setup/Started.

Best regards,

Sarah C.
Sales @ (mt) Media Temple
