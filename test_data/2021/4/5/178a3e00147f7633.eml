Lessons from the First New Deal for the Next One
William H. Janeway
University of Cambridge/Warburg Pincus
April 5, 2021
Metaphors matter.=C2=A0 As a metaphor, the =E2=80=9CNew Deal=E2=80=9D has b=
een mobilized both in response to climate change and in support of Presiden=
t Biden=E2=80=99s rescue and infrastructure initiatives. It needs examinati=
on if it is to go from serving as a mere slogan to defining a coherent prog=
ram.=C2=A0 Compelling invocation of the New Deal turns on:=20
Building state capacity for implementing interventions in the market econom=
y;=20
Navigating potential conflicts in overlapping missions; and=20
Managing inescapable tradeoffs between efficiency versus effectiveness.
For a long generation from Pearl Harbor, the language of war provided the l=
iberating rationale for mobilization of resources by the American state.=C2=
=A0 Liberating, because a legitimate war frees state actors from the constr=
aints of prospective cost-benefit analysis, where the costs are always easi=
er to quantify than the putative benefits. =E2=80=9CWhatever it takes=E2=80=
=9D is the message.
From World War II through the Korean conflict and the 40-year Cold War, inc=
luding the War on Cancer, this metaphor did its job. The overriding importa=
nce of the mission outweighed the economic calculus of opportunity cost ver=
sus net present value of expected returns.=C2=A0 In this spirit, World War =
II was won =E2=80=9Con the unorganized momentum of American Democracy,=E2=
=80=9D not by the efficient allocation of scarce resources amongst competin=
g demands.[1] [#_ftn1] But after Vietnam, the endless quagmires of Afghanis=
tan and Iraq, the War on Drugs, and the Global War on Terror, the language =
of war has lost its rallying force.=C2=A0 It has been debased.=C2=A0 This w=
hy retrieval of the =E2=80=9CNew Deal=E2=80=9D as metaphor is so relevant.
In folk memory, FDR=E2=80=99s New Deal combined relief, reform, and positiv=
e investment in one great seamless demonstration of the progressive potenti=
al of vigorous government.=C2=A0 In reality, it was complicated and conflic=
ted.=C2=A0 Multiple references to FDR=E2=80=99s own statement of purpose in=
 his 1932 campaign hint at recognition:
The country needs and unless I mistake its temper the country demands bold =
persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it =
If it fails admit it frankly and try another. But above all try something.
The successive experiments that characterized the New Deal during FDR=E2=80=
=99s first two terms, prior to the onset of World War II, illustrate the co=
nflicts - even contradictions =E2=80=93 that may be expected to result from=
 improvising policy responses to crisis. Consideration of those policy resp=
onses focuses attention on three prime lessons for any administration that =
seeks to devise and execute grand programs, whether in response to systemic=
 financial and economic collapse, a viral pandemic, or climate change.=C2=
=A0=20
(Re)Building State Capacity
New Deal: At the onset of the Great Depression, the economic footprint of t=
he Federal Government was minimal: expenditures were less than 2% of retros=
pective estimates of GDP. Apart from the armed forces totaling some 260,000=
, Federal civilian employment at 500,000 (half of whom worked for the Post =
Office) was only 1% of the employed labor force of 50 million.=C2=A0 By the=
 time Franklin Roosevelt took office in March 1933, the share of Federal ex=
penditures had almost doubled, but that was because GDP had declined in nom=
inal terms by almost 50%.[2] [#_ftn2]
This meant that the new agencies created during the famous First Hundred Da=
ys were starting from scratch. For example, the Public Works Administration=
 (discussed at greater length below), created by legislation on June 16, 19=
33, hired some 6,000 staff in two months.=C2=A0 The Deputy Administrator, H=
enry M. Waite, subsequently recalled:
First they hired lawyers, many lawyers =E2=80=93 more than 100 for the Wash=
ington office alone=E2=80=A6
After the lawyers came the engineers=E2=80=A6
Added to all these were the platoons of accountants, clerks, stenographers,=
 and typists, until there were more than 2,300 jammed into the Interior Dep=
artment building.[3] [#_ftn3]
Another 3,700 new recruits staffed the PWA=E2=80=99s 10 regional offices.
The same was true of all the other alphabet soup of Administrations, Agenci=
es, Bureaus, and Commissions created under conditions of extreme urgency.=
=C2=A0 Inevitably the Federal programs had to look to the states for suppor=
t in implementation.=C2=A0 But, constrained by their constitutional require=
ments to balance their budgets, state expenditures fell with the Depression=
-forced reduction in their tax revenues.=C2=A0 And so, in critical instance=
s as we shall see, partnerships with business became a fact of life.
In one crucial respect, however, FDR=E2=80=99s capacity to mobilize state a=
uthority was unchallenged.=C2=A0 Massive Democratic majorities in Congress =
backed his executive initiatives through his First Term, even though the po=
wer wielded by the Southern segregationist components of his coalition were=
 manifest in every piece of New Deal legislation. Substantial congressional=
 opposition only emerged in the late 1930s, as Southern Democrats increasin=
gly aligned with a Republican minority much strengthened in the 1938 off-ye=
ar election.[4] [#_ftn4]
Today: In 2018, Michael Lewis correctly anticipated the crisis of state cap=
acity that confronted the Biden Administration in January 2021.[5] [#_ftn5]=
=C2=A0 That crisis was compounded of two processes operating on two very di=
fferent timescales.=C2=A0=20
A generation-long effort to restrict the scope and scale of the Federal Gov=
ernment=E2=80=99s engagement with the market economy was aggressively pursu=
ed whenever Republican Administrations and/or Republic majorities in Congre=
ss held power, from 1981 on.=C2=A0 And from the Carter Administration, whic=
h initiated the first roll back of market regulations, through the Clinton =
Administration and even to some extent during the Obama Administration, Dem=
ocratic neoliberals acquiesced.=C2=A0=20
Agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Anti-Trust Division o=
f the Justice Department were starved of funds.=C2=A0 The Congressional Off=
ice of Technology Assessment was closed. As Matt Stoller has documented, go=
vernment officials were mandated to defer to increasingly concentrated priv=
ate contractors with the expected consequences in terms of rent extraction =
both by suppliers and the consultants increasingly invited into the process=
=2E[6] [#_ftn6]
During the four years of the Trump Administration, the attack on state capa=
city accelerated in new ways.=C2=A0 On the one hand, any existing element o=
f the Federal Government that could be deemed concerned with responding to =
climate change was proposed for liquidation, as was the Energy Department=
=E2=80=99s Advanced Research Projects Agency.=C2=A0 Additionally, whether o=
r not Congress (as with ARPA-E) refused to confirm such initiatives, the Tr=
ump Administration pursued a less transparent course.
Across the Federal Government, new rules and regulations were promulgated t=
o reduce the reach of the =E2=80=9CAdministrative State,=E2=80=9D deemed pe=
rnicious by construction.=C2=A0 And Trump appointed senior personnel dedica=
ted to opposing the mission of those agencies they had been chosen to lead.=
=C2=A0 To the extent possible, they were granted civil service status to re=
nder it more difficult for the new Administration to remove and replace the=
m.
Everywhere access to expert scientific and technological policy guidance wa=
s minimized if not totally foreclosed. The White House Office of Science an=
d Technology Policy is a case in point: it took 18 months from Trump=E2=80=
=99s inauguration for any Director to be appointed and once appointed there=
 is =E2=80=9Cscant evidence=E2=80=9D evidence that the Director=20
tried to mitigate any of the administration=E2=80=99s most controversial po=
licies relating to science and innovation. The list includes its chaotic ap=
proach to the COVID-19 pandemic, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord,=
 rolling back a slew of environmental regulations, restricting immigration,=
 and proposing deep cuts in the budgets of most federal research agencies.[=
7] [#_ftn7]
The Biden Administration has an enormous challenge just to undo the damage =
wrought in the past four years.=C2=A0 But there is a further, transcendent =
component of state capacity, one that for the most part FDR did not have to=
 confront, at least until he was challenged to pledge, during the 1940 pres=
idential campaign, that =E2=80=9Cyour boys are not going to be sent into an=
y foreign wars.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 This is the matter of basic trust in the cou=
ntry=E2=80=99s political leadership.
President Biden may be constructing a path towards rebuilding trust through=
 success in delivering the Corona virus vaccines to the arms of the America=
n public as well as delivering the retroactive insurance payments provided =
by the American Rescue Plan.=C2=A0 Demonstration of what a competent state =
can deliver in pursuit of a well-defined mission is a necessary step.=C2=A0=
 So far, it appears that the President has met the most critical test: Unde=
r Promise and Over Perform.=C2=A0 The broad public support he has earned st=
ands in stark contrast with the almost unanimous opposition of Republicans =
in the narrowly divided houses of Congress.
Strategic Missions
New Deal:=C2=A0FDR=E2=80=99s New Deal encompassed three strategic missions:=
 recovery from the Depression, reform of particular aspects of the market e=
conomy, and regime change in the fundamental structure of the American poli=
tical economy. A necessary condition for freedom to act was an assertion of=
 nationalist autonomy: escape from the =E2=80=9Cgolden fetters=E2=80=9D of =
the gold standard and refusal to stabilize the international value of the d=
ollar against sterling or the franc.[8] [#_ftn8]
On December 31, 1933, the New York Times published an open letter from John=
 Maynard Keynes to President Roosevelt. The core of the message was deliver=
ed in the third paragraph:
You are engaged on a double task, Recovery and Reform;--recovery from the s=
lump and the passage of those business and social reforms which are long ov=
erdue. For the first, speed and quick results are essential. The second may=
 be urgent too; but haste will be injurious, and wisdom of long-range purpo=
se is more necessary than immediate achievement. It will be through raising=
 high the prestige of your administration by success in short-range Recover=
y, that you will have the driving force to accomplish long-range Reform. On=
 the other hand, even wise and necessary Reform may, in some respects, impe=
de and complicate Recovery. For it will upset the confidence of the busines=
s world and weaken their existing motives to action, before you have had ti=
me to put other motives in their place=E2=80=A6.[9] [#_ftn9]
Keynes=E2=80=99 economic genius was not fully matched by his political insi=
ght, even in Britain where he failed to win over the political and administ=
rative leadership of the country to overt policies of macroeconomic stabili=
zation until World War II.[10] [#_ftn10]=C2=A0 FDR, by contrast, recognized=
 that the context of crisis was necessary to enable the profound structural=
 reforms to the American political economy that he proposed.=C2=A0=20
The central policy to which Keynes addressed himself was the National Recov=
ery Administration, Part 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act passed i=
n June 1933.=C2=A0 The NRA proposed a comprehensive system of =E2=80=9Ccode=
s of fair competition=E2=80=9D that were required to include: (1) a specifi=
ed minimum wage, (2) a specified maximum number of working hours per week, =
and (3) recognition of the workers=E2=80=99 right to collective bargaining.=
 The goal was simultaneously to restore the profitability of employers and =
to increase the purchasing of power of employees. The means were the legal =
cartelization of markets, both for goods and labor services.
Often neglected by economic analysts of the NRA is that the author of its s=
ource-text was no New Deal radical but rather Gerard Swope, President of Ge=
neral Electric. In September 1931, Swope had proposed a national assemblage=
 of trade associations under the supervision of the Federal Trade Commissio=
n with authority comparable to the NRA=E2=80=99s codes.[11] [#_ftn11] Follo=
wing where Swope had led, the NRA precisely operationalized Adam Smith=E2=
=80=99s famous remark: =E2=80=9CPeople of the same trade=C2=A0seldom=C2=A0m=
eet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends i=
n a conspiracy against the publick, or in some contrivance to raise prices.=
=E2=80=9D=20
Given the constrained state capacity of the New Deal, the industry committe=
es mandated by the NRA were dominated by business.=C2=A0 The tobacco indust=
ry, already notorious for its political clout, succeeded in preventing any =
code from emerging.=C2=A0 In the oligopolistic heavy industries =E2=80=93 s=
teel, autos =E2=80=93 the Administration=E2=80=99s only bargaining chip, ex=
emption from anti-trust enforcement, was irrelevant. By the summer of 1934,=
 after a transient surge in prices and wages, noncompliance was rampant.[12=
] [#_ftn12]=C2=A0 A year later, the Supreme Court declared the NRA and othe=
r New Deal interventions on the supply side of the market economy unconstit=
utional. By denying that the federal government had the authority to respon=
d to the crisis, the Court transformed a policy fiasco into a popular polit=
ical cause.
As the incipient recovery appeared to stall and in response to the Court=E2=
=80=99s challenge, FDR launched the substantially more radical =E2=80=9CSec=
ond New Deal=E2=80=9D of 1935, encompassing the Social Security Act, the Na=
tional Labor Relations (=E2=80=9CWagner=E2=80=9D) Act, the Banking Act of 1=
935, the Rural Electrification Administration, and the Public Utilities Hol=
ding Company Act. Recovery resumed in timely fashion for FDR=E2=80=99s triu=
mphant reelection in 1936: Recovery and Reform marched hand in hand. Althou=
gh the extent to which the Supreme Court =E2=80=9Cfollowed the election ret=
urns=E2=80=9D is contested, in the event the Court broadly validated the co=
nstitutionality of the Second New Deal.
Today: The immediate strategic priority facing the Biden Administration emb=
odies no conflict: to accelerate Recovery from the pandemic in order to Res=
tore economic prosperity.=C2=A0 The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, howev=
er, combines funding for enhanced vaccination programs and retroactive insu=
rance payments for those economically damaged by public health lockdowns wi=
th a host of progressive reforms.=C2=A0 Measures such as expanded child and=
 earned income tax credits may be formally time limited, but they suggest t=
his Administration knows how to exploit crisis for progressive ends, very m=
uch in the spirit of the second phase of FDR=E2=80=99s New Deal.
Looking Forward, Response to climate change, Inequality of income and wealt=
h, and Racial Justice may seem bound to compete for priority. But, not unli=
ke the first New Deal=E2=80=99s haphazard integration of recovery and refor=
m and President Biden=E2=80=99s own American Rescue Plan, programs to =E2=
=80=9Cgreen=E2=80=9D the U.S. economy can serve both to reduce inequality a=
nd promote racial justice. The specific mix of programs and the ways of fin=
ancing them are what matter.=C2=A0 Integration of such priorities can be ap=
proached by concentrating direct state funding and indirect state subsidies=
, financed by progressive taxation, to deliver green infrastructure prefere=
ntially to those constituencies without the resources to protect themselves=
 from the impact of climate change.=C2=A0=20
One central initiative =E2=80=93 reflexively recommended by almost all conv=
entional economists =E2=80=93 is a carbon tax high enough to endogenize the=
 costs that generating carbon dioxide imposes on the environment.=C2=A0 Get=
 the prices right, mainstream economics asserts, and the market will take c=
are of the rest, efficiently allocating resources to serve the multiplicity=
 of demands.=C2=A0 But resource allocation is not all that markets do.=C2=
=A0 They also distribute the returns generated by the employment of those r=
esources.
=C2=A0One unconventional, Nobel-prize winning economist, Joe Stiglitz, iden=
tifies the crucial flaw in the argument for a carbon tax:=20
carbon taxes have distributive implications. In particular, it may be (if c=
arbon consumption increases less than in proportion to income), and be perc=
eived to be, regressive.[13] [#_ftn13]
The politics of a carbon tax are further complicated because the distributi=
onal consequences are not only =E2=80=9Cvertical,=E2=80=9D adversely affect=
ing the poor more than the rich, but also =E2=80=9Chorizontal,=E2=80=9D wit=
h differential impacts on people with similar incomes but different degrees=
 of dependence on carbon-generating sources.=C2=A0 One obvious example is t=
he difference between city-dwellers with access to public transportation an=
d rural populations utterly dependent on their cars.=C2=A0 Any resort to ta=
xing carbon is bound to be complicated by rebates and exemptions and augmen=
ted by regulations such as increased fuel efficiency standards or even =E2=
=80=93 as in the UK =E2=80=93 by prospective banning of hydrocarbon fueled =
automobiles.
Consideration of a carbon tax as the solution calls attention to the third =
dimension along which we can learn from the first New Deal.=C2=A0 This is t=
he inevitable tension between Efficiency and Effectiveness.=C2=A0 In econom=
ic terms, a Carbon tax, indeed, would be theoretically the most efficient r=
esponse.=C2=A0 But when it comes to responding to crisis, Efficiency can be=
 the enemy of Effectiveness.=C2=A0=C2=A0 FDR=E2=80=99s New Deal offers a mo=
st relevant case in point.
Efficiency versus Effectiveness
New Deal:The National Industrial Recovery Act had two parts.=C2=A0 In addit=
ion to the NRA, it also created the Public Works Administration with an unp=
recedented appropriation of $3.5 billion. Recall that at the time, total Fe=
deral annual expenditures were less than $2 billion. What is more, dramatiz=
ing the conflicts engendered by aggressive experimentation, the Economy Act=
 of 1933 has already been passed to reduce Federal expenditures by $500 mil=
lion, honoring a campaign pledge to restore confidence by balancing the bud=
get, whose deficit was the result of the collapse in tax receipts.=C2=A0 FD=
R squared the circle by establishing an Emergency Budget, which included th=
e PWA, distinct from the traditional one.
As Administrator of the PWA, FDR named his Interior Secretary Harold Ickes.=
=C2=A0 Ickes was a committed progressive who had left the Republican Party =
to join Teddy Roosevelt=E2=80=99s third- party campaign in 1912 and never r=
eturned.=C2=A0 He inherited an Interior Department that was deeply tainted =
by corruption, most recently by the Teapot Dome Scandal of the Harding Admi=
nistration: the then Secretary had been bribed to lease naval oil reserves =
under the Department=E2=80=99s supervision to private oilmen.=C2=A0 Ickes w=
as determined to reconstruct the Department=E2=80=99s reputation as subject=
 neither to financial nor political influence.=C2=A0 And this determination=
 carried over to the PWA.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
A project proposed for PWA funding passed through a sequence of detailed an=
alyses - engineering, legal, economic, financial -, before it worked its wa=
y up to FDR himself for final approval. For Ickes, this was a feature, not =
a bug. His biographer puts it well:
Ickes firmly held that speed was less important than stability, permanence,=
 and a fair return to the government for its investment.[14] [#_ftn14]
After six months, only $110 million of the appropriation had actually been =
spent.[15] [#_ftn15]Business Week remarked that =E2=80=9CMr. Ickes is runni=
ng a fire department on the principles of a good, sound bond house.=E2=80=
=9D=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Under =
=E2=80=9CHonest Harold,=E2=80=9D however, the PWA delivered a host of great=
 works, from the Triboro Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel in New York to the Grand=
 Coulee Dam and San Francisco Bay Bridge in the far west, and all without s=
candal.=C2=A0 The PWA, indeed, represented efficiencyin the expenditure of =
public moneys for public goods.=C2=A0 =C2=A0But measured unemployment was s=
till above 20% when the first appropriation ended in 1935.=C2=A0 In respons=
e, FDR turned to a man, Harry Hopkins, who was temperamentally Ickes opposi=
te while also possessed of relationships with those big city machines that =
Ickes had dedicated himself to fighting.=C2=A0 And Hopkins had already demo=
nstrated remarkable effectivenessin the early days of the New Deal.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 In Octob=
er 1933, with few signs of recovery visible, $400 million had been pulled o=
ut of the PWA to fund the Civil Works Administration, the New Deal=E2=80=99=
s first program of =E2=80=9Cwork relief.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 Under Hopkins, the =
CWA put more than 4 million men to work at PWA wages (well above the paltry=
 level of relief payments) in barely three months.=C2=A0 It was, in fact, s=
o effective in spending its money that it ran out of cash and closed down o=
n March 1934.
Now, frustrated by the slow pace of recovery and appropriately alert to the=
 rise of radical voices such as Louisiana=E2=80=99s Huey Long, FDR asked an=
d got $4.8 billion for a new program of work relief.=C2=A0 The Works Progre=
ss Administration was led by Hopkins over Ickes staunch objections. It was =
inevitably politicized, both by the need to rely on local proposals for pro=
jects and Hopkins own propensity for alliance with local political powers.=
=C2=A0 It was all the more effective as the result, giving work to more tha=
n 5 million men over its first three years.=C2=A0=20
The broad range of projects, including public art and entertainment as well=
 as road improvements and sewage works, led critics to label it the sponsor=
 of =E2=80=9Cboondoggles.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 In 1935, Ickes suggested to Vice P=
resident Garner that =E2=80=9Cthe way the money was administered might mean=
 the defeat of the administration next year.=E2=80=9D[16] [#_ftn16]=C2=A0 A=
s usual, FDR understood the politics, remarking: =E2=80=9CIf we can boondog=
gle our way out of the Depression, that word is going to be enshrined in th=
e hearts of Americans for many years to come.=E2=80=9D=20
The PWA and the WPA exemplify the programmatic and institutional alternativ=
es for how to mobilize resources for strategic purposes.=C2=A0 During the f=
irst New Deal, they turned out to be complements, although they were hardly=
 planned as such. On a project by project basis, with each project of grand=
 scale and logistical complexity, the PWA represented efficiency in the all=
ocation of large quanta of capital: a model for the future. Given the overr=
iding priority of getting men off relief and into work, the WPA demonstrate=
d effective response to urgent need.=20
In fashioning any comprehensive response to climate change, President Biden=
 will need to avoid sacrificing effectiveness in pursuit of efficiency, esp=
ecially as Republican opposition is likely to fixate on programs they oppos=
e in principle as wasteful boondoggles in practice.=C2=A0 Yet effective res=
ponse to climate change will necessarily include grand projects of transfor=
mational infrastructure, where manifestly wasteful inefficiency may threate=
n to undermine support for the mission itself.=C2=A0 The next New Deal will=
 need both its PWA and its WPA.
Today: Response to the Corona virus to date provides an illustrative cross-=
cutting chronicle of failure and success:
First, failure to orchestrate access to key supplies =E2=80=93 masks, venti=
lators - generated a fiasco of competitive bidding by state governments and=
 amongst federal agencies as President Trump sought to deny a national resp=
onsibility that the presidential election demonstrated he could not evade.=
=C2=A0=20
But then the =E2=80=9CWarp Speed=E2=80=9D program of vaccine development co=
mbined efficiency and effectiveness.=C2=A0 Multiple parallel projects were =
funded by pre-production procurement contracts as well as R&D grants and co=
vered the spectrum from traditional approaches to the innovative mRNA techn=
ologies deployed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.=20
Third, however, delivery of vaccines into arms reverted to the same fragmen=
ted, inefficient and ineffective process that characterized the first month=
s of the pandemic until the new Administration brought some coherent rigor =
to the task.
Throughout, the diverse array of =E2=80=9Cnon-pharmaceutical=E2=80=9D regul=
ations and guidelines across the American landscape =E2=80=93 and oppositio=
n thereto - confirmed that the pandemic response would express, not overrid=
e, political polarization.
Even in the absence of the political polarization that has infected America=
n government, fashioning programs that appropriately balance between effici=
ency and effectiveness would be hard. Yet the difficulty may be somewhat ea=
sed because, when it comes to climate change, it appears that the public is=
 ahead of many politicians.[17] [#_ftn17] Of the sample polled by a consort=
ium of Yale and George Mason Universities, 75% support rejoining the Paris =
Agreement, 66% say developing clean energy sources should be a high or very=
 high federal priority; 55-82% support a broad range of regulatory and tax =
initiatives to encourage reduction in carbon-generating production and cons=
umption.=C2=A0=20
On every subject, the partisan split between Democrats and Republicans is v=
isible. As with the American Rescue Plan, Biden=E2=80=99s appeals to bipart=
isanship are likely to resonate more outside than inside Washington.=C2=A0 =
And it is suggestive that 66% of those polled =E2=80=9Csupport the Green Ne=
w Deal,=E2=80=9D although understandably at this stage =E2=80=9Conly 18% sa=
y they have heard =E2=80=98a lot=E2=80=99 about it.
In 1933, evidence of crisis was unavoidable even for those most insulated b=
y wealth: the Dow Jones Index had declined by 88% from its 1929 high; Hoove=
rvilles of the homeless were found in public parks across the nation=E2=80=
=99s cities; and the banks were closing everywhere.=C2=A0 The mandate for a=
ction was manifest. Today, building and maintaining the mandate will be an =
essential element of all responsive initiatives. What will be comparable to=
 the New Deal is the wide range of programs of varying degrees of relevance=
 to the multiple missions facing the Biden Administration post-pandemic.
Princeton University has recently published a comprehensive agenda for achi=
eving =E2=80=9CNet-Zero America=E2=80=9D by 2050.[18] [#_ftn18] The report =
presents an array of programs under 6 headings:
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 End-use energy effic=
iency and electrification
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Clean electricity: w=
ind & solar generation, transmission, firm power
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Bioenergy and other =
zero-carbon fuels and feedstocks
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 CO=E2=82=82 capture,=
 utilization, and storage\
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Reduced non-CO=E2=82=
=82 emissions
=C2=B7=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Enhanced land sinks
Of these, some call out for the sort of meticulous planning and careful imp=
lementation that characterized the PWA=E2=80=99s grand projects. Such will =
be the case with the necessary requirement to expand and extend and harden =
electricity grids nationally (even in Texas) and to deploy software to mana=
ge intermittent sources of electricity. But with other initiatives, especia=
lly when they concern the gains available from mass electrification at the =
residential and retail level, effectiveness should dominate efficiency.=20
One example of the latter, referenced in the Princeton Report, is the plan =
for =E2=80=9CRewiring America=E2=80=9D conceived by Saul Griffith and his c=
olleagues: to bring electrification to American households funded by subsid=
ized credit.[19] [#_ftn19] Using electricity alone for heating, cooking, an=
d transportation would not only contribute massively to the Net-Zero goal.=
=C2=A0 The process of universal electrification would generate millions of =
=E2=80=9Cgreen jobs=E2=80=9D and yield significant reductions in the cost o=
f living.=C2=A0 But the very distributed nature of the program =E2=80=93 li=
ke the WPA =E2=80=93 is bound to generate some degree of waste: unrepaid lo=
ans, faulty installations.=C2=A0 Public tolerance of such necessary ineffic=
iency will turn on broad public acceptance of the mission.
One example of an initiative that can serve all three missions would direct=
ly draw on a first New Deal model.=C2=A0 Then, the Rural Electrification Ad=
ministration brought electricity to Americans ignored by the public utiliti=
es as uneconomic to serve.=C2=A0 Today, the =E2=80=9Cdigital divide=E2=80=
=9D reveals an inverse correlation between income and access to broadband i=
nternet that intersects the urban rural divide.[20] [#_ftn20] When the pand=
emic closed schools across the country, the impact of the Digital Divide on=
 access to education and prospective life chances was devastating.=C2=A0 At=
 the same time, the positive effect of virtual working and meeting on carbo=
n-generating travel adds to the case for a =E2=80=9CBroadband Access Admini=
stration=E2=80=9D that would serve all three missions.
The Princeton Report correctly recognizes the need for frontier innovation =
of critical technologies. Two examples are grid-scale energy storage and ca=
rbon capture and sequestration.=C2=A0 Here the history of the American inno=
vation economy offers a compelling model.=C2=A0 The US Defense Department=
=E2=80=99s support for all the emergent technologies that combined to make =
the Digital Revolution was not limited to funding R&D.=C2=A0 It included pr=
ograms of procurement =E2=80=93 of computers, semiconductors, software =E2=
=80=93 before they were cheap and reliable enough for the commercial market=
s.=C2=A0 The American state pulled the suppliers down the learning curve, p=
referentially favoring young, entrepreneurial companies like Texas Instrume=
nts and Intel over the established giant incumbents, IBM and ATT.=C2=A0 Thi=
s was the model implicitly and effectively followed by Project Warp Speed.
There is another opportunity for the Biden Administration to learn from the=
 Obama Administration=E2=80=99s American recovery and Reinvestment Act.=C2=
=A0 Not only is that =E2=80=9Cstimulus bill=E2=80=9D now recognized as havi=
ng been sub-scale. But the =E2=80=9Cgreen=E2=80=9D elements buried within i=
t were misconceived.=C2=A0 The Act extended nine-figure loan guarantees to =
a set of GreenTech ventures. One of them was Tesla, which paid off its loan=
s from the massive private funding that Elon Musk subsequently mobilized.=
=C2=A0 Two others, sadly, were Solyndra in solar panels and A123 in advance=
d battery technology.=C2=A0 Both went bust in highly visible fashion.=C2=A0=
 Procurement contracts to follow R&D grants were the available alternatives=
, against which they might have been able to secure conventional venture ca=
pital and incidentally avoid political embarrassment if they nonetheless fa=
iled.=C2=A0=20
One strategic issue will confront the President Biden in more nuanced and c=
omplex fashion than that which faced FDR: go it alone or collaborate.=C2=A0=
 In 1933, international collaboration would have meant freezing the America=
n state in the face of calamity, even while protectionist programs of natio=
nal economic defense were proliferating globally: from the UK=E2=80=99s aba=
ndonment of free trade in favor of Imperial Preference to Nazi Germany=E2=
=80=99s autarchic determination to escape from the Versailles Treaty.
The choice is more complex today, not only because climate change is existe=
ntially global, as symbolically acknowledged by Biden=E2=80=99s return to t=
he Paris Agreement.=C2=A0 At the practical level of implementation, forty y=
ears of globalization has left the US bereft of the high-tech manufacturing=
 base that had been constructed over the previous forty years.=C2=A0 The co=
mbination of free-trade political economics and shareholder-maximization fi=
nancial economics made abandonment of that strategic resource both economic=
ally logical and politically acceptable. Doubling down in strategic opposit=
ion to China=E2=80=99s rise, therefore, has costs that go to the heart of a=
n effective response to climate change.=20
To begin with, China generates 29% of the world=E2=80=99s annual production=
 of CO=E2=82=82; the US follows with 16%.=C2=A0 No global response to the g=
lobal problem can leave out either. Beyond that fact, a recent paper in Sci=
ence magazine asserts an obvious hypothesis:
Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement will require net zero greenhouse e=
missions by 2050 and substantial reductions before then. It will also requi=
re collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the =
mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because =
of China's investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate=
 targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources=
=2E[21] [#_ftn21]
As the authors acknowledge, =E2=80=9Csome attribute China's rapid rise in L=
CET sectors to unfair industrial policies=E2=80=94such as forced technology=
 transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual proper=
ty (IP) theft.=E2=80=9D Pragmatically, nonetheless, we are where we are.=20
A wise man once said that political leadership resides in fashioning third =
alternatives to seemingly intractable dilemmas.=C2=A0 Such alternatives may=
 exist on each side.=C2=A0 Necessarily inefficient US investments aimed at =
rebuilding at home the capacity that now exists in China may well prove the=
 effective game theoretic approach towards strategic collaboration.=C2=A0 I=
t will likely be matched by China=E2=80=99s equally inefficient determinati=
on to reach the frontier in semiconductor design and fabrication in order t=
o reduce its strategic dependence on the US.=C2=A0=20
Conclusion
Saikat Chakrabarti was the co-author of the plan for a =E2=80=9CGreen New D=
eal=E2=80=9D brought to public attention by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.=
=C2=A0 He has summarized the shared purpose of the initiators:
(1) Create a plan that Democratic presidential candidates would have to res=
pond to, creating pressure on them to have a race to the top against each o=
ther on climate proposals. We aimed to have an order of magnitude increase =
in the ambition of climate proposals being put out by presidential candidat=
es and, through that, dramatically change the scale of what would be =E2=80=
=9Cpolitically acceptable.=E2=80=9D
(2) Introduce (but really reintroduce) a new approach to solving climate ch=
ange that didn=E2=80=99t pit jobs against climate, but made the project of =
solving climate change=C2=A0the same=C2=A0as growing, upgrading and develop=
ing our economy, creating millions of high wage jobs in the process.[22] [#=
_ftn22]
The tactical political initiative worked: through the presidential primarie=
s that candidate Biden wound up dominating climate change gained traction a=
s a salient issue. The central strategic insight is more remarkable and res=
onates with FDR=E2=80=99s rejection of Keynes=E2=80=99 advice to separate e=
xplicitly Recovery from Reform.=C2=A0 Given the intensely conflicted state =
of the American political economy today, it reaches beyond the terms set by=
 Chakrabarti. Any opportunity to serve the two missions that overlap in pol=
itical space with response to climate change =E2=80=93 reducing inequality =
and pursuing racial justice =E2=80=93 may only be addressed by implementing=
 the broad and inclusive agenda of investment and employment that response =
to climate change legitimizes.
Whether it is called =E2=80=9CBuild Back Better=E2=80=9D or a =E2=80=9CGree=
n Industrial Policy=E2=80=9D or, indeed, a Green New Deal, it is imperative=
 to reject the false dichotomy of =E2=80=9Cjobs against climate.=E2=80=9D H=
owever it is branded, if response to climate change is truly to renew the g=
rand promise and the meaningful =E2=80=93 if incomplete - achievements of t=
he first New Deal, it will do so by addressing the cumulative inequities th=
at have reached intolerable levels of social and cultural and political str=
ess.=C2=A0 Somehow, President Biden seems to have intuited this simple, pro=
found truth.=C2=A0 Without any doubt, efforts to implement that agenda will=
 be contested every step of the way and not a few will fail.=C2=A0 But as F=
DR put it almost 90 years ago, =E2=80=9Cabove all try.=E2=80=9D

 0 0 1em 0;">Saikat Chakrabarti was the co-author of the plan for a &#8220;=
Green New Deal&#8221; brought to public attention by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio=
-Cortez.&nbsp; He has summarized the shared purpose of the initiators:</p><=
p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 =
1em 0;">(1) Create a plan that Democratic presidential candidates would hav=
e to respond to, creating pressure on them to have a race to the top agains=
t each other on climate proposals. We aimed to have an order of magnitude i=
ncrease in the ambition of climate proposals being put out by presidential =
candidates and, through that, dramatically change the scale of what would b=
e &#8220;politically acceptable.&#8221;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font=
-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">(2) Introduce (but real=
ly reintroduce) a new approach to solving climate change that didn&#8217;t =
pit jobs against climate, but made the project of solving climate change&nb=
sp;<em>the same</em>&nbsp;as growing, upgrading and developing our economy,=
 creating millions of high wage jobs in the process.<a href=3D"#_ftn22" tit=

;">The tactical political initiative worked: through the presidential prima=
ries that candidate Biden wound up dominating climate change gained tractio=
n as a salient issue. The central strategic insight is more remarkable and =
resonates with FDR&#8217;s rejection of Keynes&#8217; advice to separate ex=
plicitly Recovery from Reform.&nbsp; Given the intensely conflicted state o=
f the American political economy today, it reaches beyond the terms set by =
Chakrabarti. Any opportunity to serve the two missions that overlap in poli=
tical space with response to climate change &#8211; reducing inequality and=
 pursuing racial justice &#8211; may only be addressed by implementing the =
broad and inclusive agenda of investment and employment that response to cl=
imate change legitimizes.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; l=
ine-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Whether it is called &#8220;Build Bac=
k Better&#8221; or a &#8220;Green Industrial Policy&#8221; or, indeed, a Gr=
een New Deal, it is imperative to reject the false dichotomy of &#8220;jobs=
 against climate.&#8221; However it is branded, if response to climate chan=
ge is truly to renew the grand promise and the meaningful &#8211; if incomp=
lete - achievements of the first New Deal, it will do so by addressing the =
cumulative inequities that have reached intolerable levels of social and cu=
ltural and political stress.&nbsp; Somehow, President Biden seems to have i=
ntuited this simple, profound truth.&nbsp; Without any doubt, efforts to im=
plement that agenda will be contested every step of the way and not a few w=
ill fail.&nbsp; But as FDR put it almost 90 years ago, &#8220;above all try=
