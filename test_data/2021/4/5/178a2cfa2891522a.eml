I wanted to follow up on these questions:


1) In regards to your Life Insurance policy:

a. Your agent said "You can choose the amount yourself, and what controls
what you pay for the insurance is your age, the amount that you want to be
insured. There is just one policy for life insurance."

Right now I have a US Life Insurance policy for $500,000 USD which costs
$130.27 USD every 3 months. I am 46 years old; what would your policy cost
to insure for a similar amount?


2) In regards to the Accident Insurance:

a. It looks like the FPlus plans cover quite a bit more than just
disability, but that for disability payments you give between 24,000,000 -
50,000,000 ISK. Is that amount a yearly payout or a total amount?

b. How long is the maximum benefit period?

c. Is there a premium, and if so under what conditions may it be waived?

d. What is the monthly cost? Can you give me a range?

e. Finally, the list at
https://vis.is/samanburdur-a-f-plus-fjolskyldutryggingum/ seem to include
four different "families" of insurance (F plus 1, F plus 2, F plus 3 and F
plus 4), but under these are twelve different categories of coverage. Does
each "family" include all the different categories in one fee or plan, or
is each category a differently priced offering?
