Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their networks in a =
newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. You and =
I have worked together in the past; I wanted to invite you to reconnect to =
see if we could help each other in the future.
=20
Below are a few of my =
current projects; let me know if any strike your interest, or just hit me =
with an update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,
Josh

Current Projects:
=20
IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an =
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. =
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!=20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=

impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
