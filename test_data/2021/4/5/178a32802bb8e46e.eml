Interesting article - brought up a number of things I hadn't thought of....=
.

From the Washington Post:

Vaccine passports and the tough questions we haven=E2=80=99t confronted
Megan McArdle
5-6 minutes
------------------------------

In the next couple of months, America=E2=80=99s vaccination program is like=
ly to
undergo a radical shift. Suddenly gone will be today=E2=80=99s world of vac=
cine
scarcity, where the anxious and eager spend hours scouring the Web for
elusive appointments. We will enter the land of vaccine overabundance,
where public health officials prod, wheedle and beg hesitant adults to
please come in and get their shots.

At that point, we=E2=80=99ll collectively confront questions that have most=
ly been
theoretical: What=E2=80=99s the best way to overcome the understandable anx=
iety of
those who worry about undetected dangers of novel vaccine technologies? How
do we locate vaccination centers to be convenient for people in rural areas=
?

Most controversial will be this question: What circumstances justify
requiring vaccination? Can it be mandatory for someone to work in a nursing
home, enroll in a public school, attend a concert, get on an airplane?
Which is to say, how much risk should the rest of us have to accept to
respect the conscience rights and bodily autonomy of fellow citizens who
don=E2=80=99t want to get vaccinated?

In December, I had a spirited Twitter exchange
<https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1334541453381545984> about this
with Noah Rothman of Commentary Magazine. I was, and remain, strongly in
favor of vaccine passports. But Rothman isn=E2=80=99t wrong to worry about =
the
effects of a society as divided as ours further partitioning itself with an
=E2=80=9Cimmunity caste
<https://www.commentarymagazine.com/noah-rothman/the-rise-of-the-immunity-c=
aste/>.=E2=80=9D
The caste line is likely to harden existing educational and partisan
barriers that are already dangerously ossified.

We also need to reckon with the pragmatic concerns raised by Michael
Brendan Dougherty of National Review, who notes
<https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/stop-the-vaccine-passport-revenge-fa=
ntasy/>
that while vaccine passports are often sold as a way to open things up,
they would actually =E2=80=9Cclose things down, because it bars people from=
 doing
things they=E2=80=99ve already been doing throughout the pandemic: shopping=
,
traveling, gathering together, attending weddings and funerals. You would
be instituting new and harsher restrictions at the very time the pandemic
was ending.=E2=80=9D

Raising the privacy costs of, say, booking travel or concert tickets might
curtail economic activity that we=E2=80=99re desperate to restore. And the
strictures would disproportionately fall on not just poor or rural
Americans but certain groups who aren=E2=80=99t eligible for vaccination, i=
ncluding
children.

As a libertarian, I=E2=80=99d add that creating a vaccine passport creates =
an
instrument of some coercive power; if such a thing exists, private entities
will use it. Which of course is the point; advocates are trying to create a
better incentive
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/krispy-kreme-free-doughn=
ut-vaccine/2021/03/25/3662706e-8d72-11eb-a6bd-0eb91c03305a_story.html?itid=
=3Dlk_inline_manual_14>for
vaccination than free doughnuts
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/covid-19-vaccine-krispy-kreme-=
donuts.html>.
All of us should be wary of initiatives that effectively create a condition
of participating in public life =E2=80=94 especially if coercion becomes a
substitute for persuasion
<https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2021/01/26/medethics-2020-107076>.

And yet we should remember that the unvaccinated aren=E2=80=99t the only on=
es at
risk of being shut out of normal life; there are also the people whose
immune systems can=E2=80=99t make good use of a vaccine. A recent study
<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777685> of 436
transplant patients nationwide, whose immune systems are suppressed to
prevent rejection of their new organs, showed poor antibody response after
the first shot of an mRNA vaccine. Between cancer patients, transplant
recipients and people receiving treatment for autoimmune diseases, a *lot*
of Americans are on immunosuppressive drugs. Shouldn=E2=80=99t we worry mor=
e about
them than about the people who choose to stay vulnerable to covid-19?

We should worry, too about the cost that choosing not to get vaccinated
imposes on everyone who *is* vaccinated: creating a reservoir of disease
that can spread to us, whether because our immunity wanes or because a
variant mutates enough to evade our defenses. People would get sick: some
might die and many others might need booster shots. If someone gets to
force extra shots on someone else, I=E2=80=99d argue it should be the peopl=
e who
have already chosen to protect not just themselves but also the community.

As for the economic costs, I=E2=80=99m skeptical that the net effect of vac=
cination
passports will be to reduce economic activity. Rather, we=E2=80=99re making=
 it less
costly for people who are relatively risk-averse and have been avoiding
public places, and more costly for the more risk-tolerant who don=E2=80=99t=
 want to
get vaccinated. Before vaccines, there were good arguments for both sides
of that tradeoff, but as vaccines become broadly available, banning vaccine
passports would essentially be subsidizing pointless risks.

That=E2=80=99s not to say there aren=E2=80=99t real concerns to address, ev=
en beyond those
Rothman and Dougherty raise. Vaccine passports are going too far if they
become so ubiquitous that they are effectively a mandate =E2=80=94 if, say,=
 you
need one to enter a grocery store or access health care. They should not be
deployed until everyone has at least a chance to get a shot. And they must
be paired with aggressive efforts both to overcome people=E2=80=99s fears a=
nd make
it as convenient as possible to get vaccinated.

Most important, we should remember the real costs we=E2=80=99re imposing on=
 others,
and ourselves, by choosing this course. Vaccine passports may be the best
of a set of bad options, but that doesn=E2=80=99t make them a good thing.

Love you,,
Sharon
