Hey! Do you have any idea how much customer training Google Analytics did
when they first rolled out? We're finding that we're doing a lot of it with
our customers and see a lot of parallels (new types of data, new management
possibilities, etc. etc.). Any suggestions on someone to talk to / compare
notes with would be hugely helpful.

Otherwise life here in Iceland is getting warmer. It's now light from ~4am
to ~10pm, and is consistently above freezing. It's a weird land, you ought
to come visit before tourism resumes.

Let me know if a catch up call would interest you, with the caveat that
aside from the odd NFT / podcast / CGM project I'm mostly focused on
Indigometrics these days!

- Josh
