Khatdija, Bria;

I wanted to update you that we've officially shifted our I&D model from a
consortium to a convening. :)

I.e., instead of asking companies to openly share their strategies and
results with a closed team, we're offering enrolled companies an annual
event in which we aggregate and report on the overall insights, best
practices, and metadata analytics which proved most informative on the I&D
efforts we've been measuring and supporting.

We'll also bring in industry-leading experts to help provide additional
insights into how the field is progressing, what new trends to expect, and
how leaders are harnessing new strategies to create impact. At present
we're working with Wharton's People Analytics group on a whitepaper
to validate our findings, so I expect this would include folks like Adam
Grant, etc.

I was curious if you thought this was the kind of thing your group might
appreciate. Let me know if it's worth a brief call to discuss - W50 taught
me everything I know about a really high-quality convening!

All best,
Josh
