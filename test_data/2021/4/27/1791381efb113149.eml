OK, keep me posted and I'll return the favor.

In terms of the CGM project, I'm pitching a podcast series to W50 now. Once
that closes (either to execute or abandon) I'd like to take one last shot
at the CGM project as previously outlined (i.e., solely to a large
corporate partner), assuming you don't want to run with it. I've been
pitching a variety of projects over the last few months alongside
Indigometrics and am clearing off enough of them to want to get this one
pushed through one way or another!!
