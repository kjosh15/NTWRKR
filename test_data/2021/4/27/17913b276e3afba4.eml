Hey Sonali. Just a heads up that our targets have changed and we're very
keen to talk to American females of color with a data science background.
We really want to get those voices into the software models we're
developing, and are building out a board to support that kind of growth
specifically.

Right now we're in discussions with four large multinationals. If/when any
one of them signs on we'll be in a position to ask you for help in hiring.
:)

Is there anything I can do to help support you? I recently pitched Recurse
to a group of large-org CHROs, so hopefully that helped!

All best wishes,
Josh

<div>We&#39;re also looking at the depressing reality of hiring in 2021 wit=

 by accident (friends of friends or nephews of investor contacts, etc.) so =

I hope this email finds you and yours safe and healthy; it&#39;s been a hel=
l of a year.<br>
<br>
Fortunately I&#39;m writing with good news as I&#39;m looking to learn more=
 about your placement services. My startup (<a href=3D"http://www.indigomet=
rics.com" target=3D"_blank">www.indigometrics.com</a>) needs to hire our se=
cond tech position. We&#39;re currently in the middle of getting our first =
raise, but we&#39;re profitable and want to get the interviews started.<br>
<br>
The position is fully remote although we favor GMT and EST. We need someone=
 who can get up to speed on AWS microservices, optimize/converting our exis=
ting codebase (Python backend / C# front end) to same while collaborating o=
n getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is an ability to =
be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep learning curves.<br>
<br>
The upside is that we&#39;re currently working on DE&amp;I with the biggest=
 construction firm in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 500 co=
mpanies on a separate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest that I know of. I=
f we get it we&#39;ll be helping create systemic, public accountability for=
 much if not most of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel like we&#39;d rea=
lly benefit from some more diverse representation in our team!!<br>
<br>
A year ago I wouldn&#39;t have expected to be here, but the shift to distri=
buted workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We&#39;re seeing appet=
ites increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sharp to join th=
e team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about your fee struc=
ture and how we could get started?<br>
<br>
Finally - how the hell are you?? It&#39;s been a long time, and a weird yea=
r. Let me know if you&#39;re game for a short call just to catch up some ti=
me!!<br>
<br>
All best,<br>
Josh<br></div>
