Josh,

Thanks for reaching out to (mt) Media Temple. You can add additional hosting to the same account. I see you are currently on a Grid Service. The Grid is no longer offered on our front of site. It's been replaced by the Shared Hosting with cPanel. It has a cost of $200 for the first year and then $240 each year after. We also offer additional discounts for 2 year and 3 year pricing. 

Shared Hosting comes with Unlimited Storage, Unmetered Bandwidth and 512MB of ram. 

With regards to the migration, you can opt to perform the migration yourself or have our advance support do it for you. The cost for a migration is $100 per domain. The migration covers files and one database for one domain and can take up to 7 days (or less) to complete. Once the migration has been completed, you'll receive an update from the advance support team to test the site on the new Shared Hosting service. At that point, DNS can be changed for indigometrics.com to point from the grid to the new shared hosting plan. 

With regards to the SSL certificate, since you are using a multi-domain SSL, you'll need to remove the SSL and re-add once the domain is on the Shared Hosting. Our support team can assist you with this. 

Please let me know how wish to proceed.

Best regards,

Pedro E.
Sales @ (mt) Media Temple
