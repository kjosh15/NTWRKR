Shane,

It's been a while; I hope you and yours are doing well as we've moved
through the pandemic!

I'm reaching out to see if you were interested in discussing the human
analytics platform I co-developed. We just signed our third large
multinational and have three more in active conversation with ten more
total in the pipeline - most of which are focused on measuring Inclusion
and Diversity. The data we're getting so far is transformational from an
organizational perspective.

We're also preparing to release an HBR article and are starting work with
Wharton's People Analytics group on a whitepaper documenting the platform's
efficiency, so there is more momentum near at hand.

I seem to recall you having an interest in algorithmically modulated
culture change. We're doing it, but the implications are getting awfully
large and I'd love to get your take. Are you interested?

All best wishes,
- J
