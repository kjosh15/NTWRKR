Thoughts and notes on podcasting:

While my podcasting is corporate.  I would classify it as developer
advocacy content.  And more humanizing than most of what gets made.
Especially a brand like IBM that has no consumer products this is something
they need.  Although not something that they have been able to do very
well.  Even with a lot of resources.  By there nature corporations  get
locked into echo chamber content with an agenda.  Which pleases
stakeholders trying to achieve a quarterly goal.   But comes across as
boring and contrived to an audience....developers in my case.  I don=E2=80=
=99t
fault anyone for that.  It=E2=80=99s just a product of scale and structure.=
  And
don=E2=80=99t think attempts to organize differently have proven themselves=
.  But
their are clearly ways of working in these structures that can be highly
productive.  And they are not about scoffing or demeaning the hierarchy.
By 50% luck and 50% hard work I was able to pitch this as a new full time
role after 4 years in the advocacy trenches.  So I was able to walk that
line of pleasing internal stakeholders and an external audience. My
developer advocacy organization has a cross organization mandate.  Which I
took seriously and act on.  Also I am able to do this job because I am
rather self sufficient in that I do 95% of the work myself.  Even when I
get some help it=E2=80=99s usually fleeting and not that helpful. So I am a=
 lot of
bang for the buck compared to specialist teams who can execute but at a
much greater cost and without same degree of authenticity.  As no one
person on those teams know the tech, organizational dynamics, and have the
presentation & production skills.  Whereas I can be very efficient and fast
because I have all those things.
