Hey Josh (and cc'ing Elise too for viz because I see you were included on
that email too),

Unfortunately, not a ton we can do on our side because it's most likely
that many of these folks are just hearing the promos on The Daily, doing a
quick Google, and digging up your emails. If anyone tries to email the show
through Apple Podcasts, our feed, or another means, the address listed is:
tbrandpodcasts@nytimes.com

You can feel free to copy/paste a response like the below! Or, don't feel
obligated to respond at all.

*"Hi there, thanks for reaching out! *

*For any booking inquiries or questions about Built for Change, please feel
free to reach out to the production team at: tbrandpodcasts@nytimes.com
<tbrandpodcasts@nytimes.com>"*
