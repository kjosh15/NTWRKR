Thanks, Jennifer! Three questions:

1. Is it possible to link to Gilded as the service provider / producer? I'd
written the proposal assuming it was white label - knowing they'd be
positioned as an available service to members may help them amortize costs.

2. Is it possible to position me as an advisor to *all* W50 members in my
role as host? We already have a structure in place for this for Innovating
50 members - if I can provide this for everyone that could help further
defray the overall price tag.

3. What range are you looking for in terms of a podcast? I'm hesitant to
suggest testing a smaller slate of episodes as you won't be able to
generate awareness to really get good data on appetite, retention,
feedback, etc.

Let me know your thoughts on the above and let's see if we can't find a
there, there!

All best,
Josh
