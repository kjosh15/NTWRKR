Just following up - let me know when works for you to reconnect!

Also, wanted to update you that we've officially shifted our I&D model from
a consortium to a convening. :)

I.e., instead of asking companies to openly share their strategies and
results with a closed team, we're offering enrolled companies an annual
event in which we aggregate and report on the overall insights, best
practices, and metadata analytics which proved most informative on the I&D
efforts we've been measuring and supporting. We'll also bring in
industry-leading experts to help provide additional insights into how the
field is progressing, what new trends to expect, and how leaders are
harnessing new strategies to create impact. Not sure if this impacts
anything on your end, but figured I'd share just in case!

best,
Josh
