Chris, apologies for the hasty pword switch to your email account. Given
that the change is in place (I can't go back and revert it) I've ensured
that worst case scenario you can just log into gmail.com as
chris@indigometrics.com with the pword I sent to get your email.

Once you have time, follow the instructions here:
https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/171710?hl=en if you want to
download your email, cal, etc. to Outlook.

Again, I know we're moving fast, but the last thing you needed was to have
your email account made more difficult to access while at your folks. On
the upside, the rest of the team can start calendaring, etc. immediately on
the MX transfer.

More soon,
Josh
