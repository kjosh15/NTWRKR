We can certainly get started by then, but it would be difficult -
practically - to get everything in place for a truly safe launch in that
frame. It takes time for the accounts to validate, for the banks to confirm
payment information, for the platforms to migrate data pointers, etc. - all
elements outside our control (although they are increasingly expedited.)

On my end, I'd want to make sure you have a fully documented process (in
case I get hit by a truck), that there's a secure key management process in
place (so nothing gets stolen/lost), and that there's a clear chain of
accounting.

Let me get you a rough proposal ASAP and we can decide if we want to follow
the process outlined. Once we have a go/no-go we can proceed as fast as the
platforms employed will support and your taste for security allows. For
example, we can hold the keys virtually while the NFT goes live, and then
afterwards migrate to a cold wallet (a real-life USB stick) for better
protection. That sort of trade-off would expedite the process with
temporary increased exposure.

More soon,
Josh

 he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#3=
9;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve been working with a friend=
 who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we&#=
39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were on the right tr=

he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand, gallery, or =
