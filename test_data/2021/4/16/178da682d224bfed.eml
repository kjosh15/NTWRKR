 still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like =
to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve been working with a friend who is c=
urrently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been=
 predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were on the right track when =
he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#39; who had his credentials on a $200k=
 NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants t=

to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand, gallery, or reseller =
first. It&#39;s very much the wild west ATM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead o=

 you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or some other place in the year ahead f=
or a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love back at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><=
