Vicki just got back to me to let me know that they'll send a proposal over
soon. They seem keen but know it's not an immediate need.

In terms of your list, do you want me to lift the corporate names off this
doc to do a connection check? Otherwise I think I have a good idea of who
to watch for opportunistically.

Thanks!
Josh
