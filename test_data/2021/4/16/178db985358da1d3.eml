Bruce,

The latest conversation I had was with Dr. Jack Kreindler (
https://www.chhp.com/our-founders/jack-kreindler), who suggested the
Baysian adaptive trial. Some quick notes:


###

He pointed out that change piques interest, and that the surprise comes
from when people learn - that's a reward function.

He pointed me at www.medable.com, which looks like an all-in-one
interface/data collection research platform which could expedite the entire
project and reduce the dev overhead to fundamentally UX/UI.

Jim Pates, his lab manager, could do in-lab work in the UK. Jack's company
designs and operates these kinds of trials for a flat fee.

He felt that a decentralized design was the right way to do it.

He also thought we could partner with someone like Scripps, and suggested
we skip Apple (too hard to work with) and just invite Abbot (for devices)
and J&J (for users to test).

What he thought was novel was:

1. Using CGM as a signal to change behavior.
2. Doing large scale test to find what works.

###

My take-away was that I needed to update the deck I send you with three
things:

a) Give a graphic illustration of the *types* of data/UX elements I could
test, to make that part more intuitive,

b) Include the Baysian adaptive trial as it 1. produces the highest impact
arrangement of elements the fastest, and 2. is basically completely
automated.

c) Add in more content around the partners (Jack's company CHHP, IDEO,
Medable, etc.) to make it clear that this is a one-check-and-get-results
opportunity.

Once those things are clear I think we could simply shop it around at a
senior level and see if we get any bites. There are only so many players
who could write the check and provide the user base - and who also have the
apparatus to execute on the results. If any of them go for it, then it's
fundamentally a matter of stakeholder management and making sure Jack's
team gets the pieces it needs.

That's my $0.02, anyway. I'd LOVE to be a part of the kickoff, partner
acquisition, and storytelling around the platform (esp. as it's a personal
experience that brought me to this), but I don't have the ability to
drive/build the company it would produce. (Keeping in mind that this kind
of platform is infinitely replicable and would define a fundamentally new
approach to testing-forward emerging medtech solutions.) If we could find a
way to amortize my time to do the launch I'd love to step back into an
advisory role going forward while maintaining a minority stake in the
company.

Let me know what you think! I sent you an invite for next week; let me know
if that works and if not when would.

All best,
Josh
