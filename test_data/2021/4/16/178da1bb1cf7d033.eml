I'll shortly be updating your @indigometrics.com email password (I'll send
it to you via Signal).

You can use the new password with the same configuration and everything
will function as usual until I switch the MX records to enable GSuite. At
that point you'll have to repoint your client (here's
<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/171710?hl=3Den> instrux if you u=
se
Outlook, for example), or log into gmail.com.

There may be a short lag while this transition is happening, but it's no
mail should be lost (I'll run a second migration after the MX record shift
occurs).

Once I've confirmed the transition you can update your password and we
should be set with Workspace going forward.

P.S. Also, separate question, but do you all use a password manager like
LastPass? Seems like a good corporate platform to have - let me know if
anyone has any preferred counter suggestions.

Similarly, should we also pay for an incremental backup service like
Backblaze if everything is on the cloud?
