    Josh,<br>
    <br>
    Good to hear from you and I hope you had a great holiday.&nbsp; I must
    confess my vacation is still ongoing - I'm now up in Scotland
    cycling on the beach and eating delicious Arbroath Smokies.&nbsp; Do the=
y
    do a lot of smoked fish in Iceland?&nbsp; Back to reality next week.<br>=

    <br>
    Since our chat in NYC I've been thinking a lot about some of the
    ideas we discussed - I read your book and a few of those articles on
    bitcoin as a platform - really fascinating stuff.&nbsp; I get the feelin=
g
    that there are a whole host of developments in those two areas which
    are going to change the world radically, it's just not clear to me
    exactly how yet.&nbsp; And that's the part that gets me really excited,
    finding that out, working out how to do it and taking it to the
    world.<br>
    <br>
    Now, I know we only really met recently and barely have an
    understanding of where each of us is coming from, but I have this
    feeling that together we could forge a mutually beneficial
    partnership to develop some of the above.&nbsp; I think we each bring
    something to the table that the other doesn't have, but more than
    that, I think our intelligence, experience and curiosity means
    working together we can get to places neither of us could reach

t
    after all these years and all the things I've done, that carries
    weight with me.<br>
    <br>
    We are not talking massive r&amp;d labs here or indiscriminate
    scattershot funding with the hope that one idea will pay off.&nbsp; More=

    like the careful investment of our time and money to select a few
    things we believe in and then a massive drive to make them happen.&nbsp;=

    I've done this a few times in my life and I am pleased to say it's
    always been successful, usually with results that exceed what I
    expected (the Club and my windfarms being only two examples).&nbsp; <br>=

    I don't know what your situation is vis a vis your time, work
    committments, money etc and it may be you're too involved elsewhere
    to pick this up, but have a think about the above and if you are
    interested let's discuss by phone or email.&nbsp; I am planning another
    trip to NYC around 7-14 Sept - if you are in town we could try and
    kick a few things about then.<br>
    <br>
    Along the way I think we can have a lot of fun as well and, like all
    steps into the unknown, we might end up in a good place that neither
    of us could have foreseen from the beginning - and that's what life
    is all about!<br>
    <br>
    I'll tell you about the hydra project when I see you since it's too
    complicated to write down.&nbsp; Still not sure if the principal party i=
s
    mad/bullshitting/could work with a reduced version/would be hell to
    work with....<br>
    <br>
    Speak soon.<br>
    <br>
    Best wishes<br>
    Steve<br>

              Great to see you yesterday and our chat got my creative
              mojo into gear again also.&nbsp; I'll read your book on holida=

              in Italy now and let's catch up after that to kick around
              a few ideas.&nbsp; <br>
              Had another meet on the hydra project this morning - still
              digesting...<br>
              FYI attached a couple of things on liquid air for you -
              one short, the other with more detail.<br>
              <br>
              Enjoy Iceland with the family and we'll be in touch soon.<br>

                        your shortlist of interesting tech and I'll see
                        if I know anyone that could be useful. In the

                        to keep you company on the ride home/to Italy,

Long time no speak! I've got big news: I'm hosting a new television series
called "The Link" for the National Geographic Channel, and it's coming out
tomorrow, May 25th at 7pm/6c.

The show is about the history of human innovation, tracing the connections

between the world's greatest inventions in art, science, medicine, finance
and more, from ancient times up to the present day. It's chock full of crazy=

stuff like underwater helicopter evacuations, Indy race car driving, the
Black Plague, and playing with the codebreaking devices that won World War

II. If you've ever found yourself clicking "just one more link" when you
should have been going to bed, this is the show for you - each episode spans=

a dozen or so technologies, and traces how each one was dependent on the
capabilities provided by the one before it.

It's a lot of fun, and it's also one of the last shows on television that
doesn't hinge on someone getting kicked off the island, being humiliated in
front of their peers, or getting drunk and doing regretful things. This is

our last shot to see if anyone still cares about intelligent programming, so=

it's hugely important that we move the needle on its ratings.

So if you've ever loved a science show like Nova, or gotten crazy excited
watching Myth Busters, this is your chance. Please tune in each Thursday,
set your DVR, and indulge me as I send out the occasional email reminder.
Most importantly of all, please help us spread the word! You can get all
kinds of great info, clips, behind the scenes blogs etc on the website
linked below.

And if you enjoy the show, please join in on the discussion on facebook
(<a href=3D"http://facebook.com/thelinktv" target=3D"_blank">facebook.com/th=
elinktv</a>) tweet about it (using the hashtag #TheLink), or do
whatever else strikes you to help spread the word.

Thanks a gazillion,
Josh Klein
