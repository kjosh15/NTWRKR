Very much so. Thanks again for the introduction, Richard! It was huge just
to hear someone else say the words "billion dollar company." ;)

More seriously, he's absolutely right that some analytical rigor would be
well applied here. I'm hopeful he'll spend a little more time explaining
his framework and to get a better idea of how/if he's interested in the
company.

Looking forward to tomorrow's call - and especially to any comments you may
have on how I presented myself/Indigometrics both today and tomorrow! Your
calling bullshit capabilities are highly refined: I didn't see so much as
an eyebrow raise during the entire conversation. Curious what your takeaway
was.

All best wishes,
Josh
