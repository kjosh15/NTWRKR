Spoke to her just earlier - she's SUPER sharp!! Had an excellent
conversation; thanks so much for the intro!

On a side note, I also spoke to Jennifer and April a couple days ago and am
sending a revised pitch to them. Thanks for the connection and I'll keep
you in the loop.

All best wishes,
Josh
