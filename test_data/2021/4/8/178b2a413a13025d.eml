Spoke to John Rizzo <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfrizzo/> just now via a
friend's introduction. He was very clear on three points:

1. This is a billion dollar company, easy.
2. Don't take VC if you can at all avoid it.
3. Work backwards from your goals to determine any actual funding
requirements.

He didn't say "I want to invest," but did ask for another call to do that
last step with my via a framework he used to teach go-to-market at Stanford
(which should be useful all on it's own), and my contact to him thinks he
may be keen on investing.

TL;DR: Billion dollar company, reinforced. ;)
