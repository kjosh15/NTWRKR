Andy,

Thanks again for the call earlier today. I'll get a revised version of the
W50 doc together ASAP as per our notes; otherwise please let me know when
you've had a chance to think through a sizzle reel for other projects as
per our conversation.

Looking forward to it,
Josh

39;d know exactly who to talk to at Microsoft about pitching a Future of Wo=
rk show, and may even be willing to endorse it. They don&#39;t have anythin=
g in this space specifically, but do have a pretty big department focused o=
n the topic. I also have Jordan Harbinger&#39;s agent who is tied into them=
 so we could submit through multiple angles at once. <br><br>2. I can go to=
 the following companies (all very large) if you can help me qualify any of=
 them:<br>	Blackrock<br>	HP<br>	Verizon<br>	Workday<br>	Google<br>	Masterca=
rd<br>	Motorola<br>	IDEO<br>	Walmart<br>	Amazon<br><br>3. Crunchbase has a =
list of ~1000 recently funded, Small-to-Medium sized businesses sortable by=
 the size of their recent raise. We could use this to make a list to pull t=
argets from to further qualify for outreach:<br><br><a href=3D"https://www.=

<br>Let me know if doing this sort of more scaled approach to targeting mak=
es sense to you. In the meantime I am continuing to push W50. <br><br>Other=
wise, it seems like we could start with a direct pitch for a Future of Work=
 podcast pitch to Microsoft via Jaron and Jordan, and then try to formalize=
 a qualification process for the second and third options while it progress=
es so we&#39;re ready to send a more bulk email when the show hits. Or none=
 or some of those options. What do you think?<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br><=

br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode =
for a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all development (crea=
tive), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, prod=
uction, post-production and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute=
 at the level we do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work proce=
ss, it varies. However, I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh wi=
ll work together to build and execute a creative podcast strategy that best=
 serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, =
and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along th=
e way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production log=
istics, including: development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking=
, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive m=
usic.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our =
call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, w=
e don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on =
a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically =
the clients put together a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategi=
ze together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordin=
arily competitive, so it requires another budget for distribution and marke=
ting. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#3=
9;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case, distribution is =
super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long story short,=
 we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented company. Mi=
ght be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York=
 Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Ph=
arell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many =
more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the for=
mer editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They=
&#39;re that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&=
quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. T=
hey&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50=
, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing=
 leaders from each group to create a series of insights to share across all=
 the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind=
 of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was much more practica=
l than what he had considered (which was focused on interviewing outside ex=
perts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the other side =
of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their appro=
ach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this i=
nternally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the=
 risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources. (Although =
I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth p=
itching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a o=
ne-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;=
m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve =
worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him =
