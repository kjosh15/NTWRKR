You beat me to it! I think I may have picked up the calendly link idea from
you...

Regardless, it's constrained to the next couple weeks, which unfortunately
are booked up due to my sister visiting me here in Iceland. Do you have a
longer view, or (hehehe) does sometime here <http://josh.is/scheduling>
work for you?

All best,
Josh
