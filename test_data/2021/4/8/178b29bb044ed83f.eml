Richard, thanks again for making the connection. I'm saving some fermented
shark just for you.

John, pleasure speaking with you. Your insights were spot on but I feel
like we got to the most interesting question last, which is if this is a
billion dollar company how do we avoid those near-death experiences (and
how fast can we move) to get to it? I've attached our overview deck and
credentials for our sandbox are below - if you're willing, I'd love to
schedule another call to talk through the analytic go-to-market framework
you described and to see what sort of planning you'd suggest for getting to
that first $1bn.

Gratefully,
- J
