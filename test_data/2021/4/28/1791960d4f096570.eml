Josh,

Thank you for your quick response. 

Really the Shared hosting is the only option with Cpanel, it doesn't just limit you to a WordPress only site. I can certainly assist with getting the new Shared Server Deluxe added to a new account, below is the information we would need:

Company Name (if applicable)
Owner's Name (first and last name).
Billing Address (Street and Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country).
Email (please ensure this is accurate, as this is what the new account owner will use to sign in).
Phone number.

Once I get this information back I can get the new account established with the Shared Hosting Deluxe Yearly Plan. 

Below are some of the KnowledgeBase articles we have about Getting started with the Shared Hosting Plan as well as moving your website over.

 Support can always help assist with any questions or issues that possibly arise.

Best regards,
