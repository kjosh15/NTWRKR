Sweets,

There are a number of things that we need to move forward together; I'm
putting them here so we can (possibly!) move them forward asynchronously.

1. financial review; pay off CC. Can you take a look at our budget, our
finances, and make a suggestion for how much we can pay down the CC?

2. order stuff for folks to bring. Here are the things on my list; if you
let me know what else you'd add I can make the Amazon order and (if you
tell me what the kids need and if it makes sense to order them in the US)
the vivo barefoot order. The glasses and contacts you need to order
yourself. :)

- new glasses - Zenni?
- CD->Bluetooth device
- more glasses cleaning cloths
- terra plana's for menfolk

3. review pics / list from Gustavo. I forwarded you the email; if you can
reply to it I'll send you the pics.

4. review pitch for Business Iceland. Here's what I'm suggesting so far:

- Advising on special projects like Science City Reykjavik
Retainer agreement for X hours/month

- Seeking partners for specific existing projects, like Algae, greenhouses,
electric cars
Single project from their existing list for $X over 3 months with clearly
defined deliverables and KPIs.

- Seeking partners for specific new projects, like Tesla autonomous vehicle
fleets to test Icelandic Test Market prospect
Specific project from a list provided by us for $X over 3 months with
clearly defined deliverables and KPIs. This project would be put forward as
fitting within their list of 6 primary categories, leveraging direct
relationships we uniquely can bring, and would include us doing the primary
research before making the pitch.

note that these last two options can employ my startup (w/ my partner) to
do research, outreach, etc. to provide greater impact.

Love you,
Josh
