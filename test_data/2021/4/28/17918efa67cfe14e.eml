Josh,

Thank you for contacting Media Temple! I'm sorry you are having issues with email being accepted by recipients.

I regret that I am unable to answer your question.  There are so many variables involved with sending and receiving emails that it is impossible to know if the same email from your Grid would have been accepted.  

I notice that your subject line refers to DMARC protocols. A DMARC record is used in conjunction with SPF and DKIM and these three components work wonders together to authenticaticate a message and determine what to do with it. If DMARC is being rejected, I recommended checking your SPF and DKIM records. A great resource at mxtoolbox.com provides tools to test your DNS records among other things. I would also recommend analyzing the header and your zone records for more information about the failure.
