Sounds good - I expect he=E2=80=99d enjoy the dev challenge.

Why don=E2=80=99t we ask Lachlan for an estimate? It=E2=80=99s something I=
=E2=80=99ve been pushing
him for anyway, and it=E2=80=99s give Andrew something to respond to in cas=
e he
needs to help support the dev effort. I take it Andrew is heads down on
other things and can=E2=80=99t address this?
