Hey bud,

All is well! I had previously been doing CNC automation for California
Closets and writing inventory software. Now I'm doing carpentry as my
father is looking to retire but I still do software/hardware as a hobby and
am always looking to help/consult/collaborate. Wanna build something
awesome?? Hope you're doing well brother!

Regards,

Michael
