Wanted to followup to see if there was reason to reconnect. I'm curious to =

All best,
Josh

Current Projects:
=20
IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.=
com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for autonomously managing =
behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!=20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Technology and Innovation Consulting(http://www.josh.is): as ever, I =
continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology strategy and =
new innovation / product development. We've seen some radical changes in =
the last year - the winners are acting on it!
