Hi Joshua,

Thanks for reaching out here! Given the demand-driven nature of the GLG m=
arketplace, different topics and investment themes directly dictate our o=
utreach at any time. As our business continues to grow and our clients' r=
esearch interests expand, we are hopeful that we can identify more opport=
unities that align with your background and experience.

We cannot always predict the direction our client will ultimately take wi=
th the projects you are invited to. However, a complete profile and quick=
 responses can improve your chances of being selected. I went ahead and r=
eviewed your profile, and the following are some things I believe could h=
elp highlight your expertise. The two main sections to focus on are the '=
Summary' and the 'Work History' section. You can access this by clicking =
here: https://services.glgresearch.com/cm-home-profile/#resume


- The 'Summary' is where you can add a high level summary of your profess=
ional background, functional experience, and skills.
- The 'Work History' section should include detailed information about yo=
ur current and/or past roles. This section should be as built out as poss=
ible and include thorough descriptions of each position that you've held.=
 You can include specific details about your responsibilities, skills, sp=
ecialties, industry knowledge and anything else that is notable.

All of the information that you include in the 'Work History' section is =
searchable so that GLG can find the most relevant project opportunities t=
o invite you to. This means that the more detailed information you provid=
e, the more likely you are to receive relevant project invitations.

If you have any questions or need more help, please let me know!

Best,
Tirsa Bernal
