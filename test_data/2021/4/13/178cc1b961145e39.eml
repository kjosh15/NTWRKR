Turns out we got delayed at the opticians (who didn=E2=80=99t think to ment=
ion that
they wanted to dilate our eyes...) so didn=E2=80=99t end up connecting with=
 you.

That said, we=E2=80=99ve learned that R.vik has some decent ramen and a kil=
ler
comic book shop, so will definitely be back. Would love to connect again!!

Maybe a call in the next few weeks just to compare notes?

Apologies for vanishing today,
Josh
