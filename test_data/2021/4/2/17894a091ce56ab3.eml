Need to read more of these, but some very surprising insights that on reflec=
tion make a lot of sense. Having all your dev outsourced, for example, seeme=
d initially like a negative but may be a big plus if it enables a buyer to m=
ore quickly take over and manage the business. Similarly, it reinforced the i=
mportance of well documented code and business processes, as well as highlig=
hting our differentiators (such as customer retention and lifetime value.)

Lots of key elements to start aiming towards (and validating!) here.
