Doesn't feel too direct; they=E2=80=99re clearly very focused on feelings. =
I think
our behavior vs feelings (esp. as additive to engagement software) is still
a very big differentiator... At least until we articulate it very clearly
and very publicly!

That=E2=80=99s my biggest worry right now - we=E2=80=99re getting closer to=
 =E2=80=9Ccoming out=E2=80=9D as
a big new thing (which a Wharton white paper could def. validate), at which
point all guns will be suddenly pointed at our space. I want to be able to
have an excellent M&A convo by then!
