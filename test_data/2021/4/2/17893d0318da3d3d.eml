A good perspective on angel/early stage VC - he wants $25K/month in gross
profit with strong growth to even consider at a $4M valuation, and that for
a $500k investment round. :/

Thanks for the note Josh.

Please use the form at the bottom of our Submit page for potential
investment consideration.

http://rightsidecapital.com/submit/

We don't want to waste your time so you should know that, at a high level,
we invest in tech companies raising rounds of $500K and less at valuations
of $3M and less that already have a live product with initial revenues.
(Occasional exceptions to $1M and $6M, but _starting _at $25K/month in
gross profit with strong growth to even consider at a $4M valuation).

It's probably worth carefully reviewing the detailed factors in the
Automatic No and Pro Tips sections of that page.

*** Note specifically that we always require the product already be in the
hands of users/customers and almost always require initial revenues.

Best,

Kevin

Below are a few of my current projects; let me know if any strike your
interest, or just hit me with an update on what you're working on. Or let's
set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,
