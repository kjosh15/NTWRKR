Monday I'm in transit, so I sent an All-hands invite for Tuesday at 10am
GMT; Lachlan, let me know if you'll be able to talk to Andrew before then.
Loreley, Chris, if this is too soon for another All-Hands let me know and
I'll drop you from the invite. I'll send two all-hands for the week after,
ongoing.

Similarly, Thursday I'm already booked up so I made an invite for Friday,
same time; if that doesn't work for anyone let me know!

Loreley, Lachlan, if you'd like a one-to-one next week let me know
separately and we'll find a time.
