><br>3. Crunchbase has a list of ~1000 recently funded, Small-to-Medium siz=

 to make a list to pull targets from to further qualify for outreach:<br><b=

 Hey Josh,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =
COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k p=
er episode for a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all develo=
pment (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shi=
pping, production, post-production and exclusive music. Everything it takes=
 to execute at the level we do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a=
 work process, it varies. However, I think what you can say is something li=
ke:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded =
and Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast strateg=
y that best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial=
 approval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoin=
ts along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all pro=
duction logistics, including: development (creative), research, writing, fa=
ct-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and =
exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting=
 at in our call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distribute t=
he shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, though). =
We rely on a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and=
 typically the clients put together a marketing plan as well. However, we c=
an strategize together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is=
 extraordinarily competitive, so it requires another budget for distributio=
n and marketing. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcas=
t; if it&#39;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case, distr=
ibution is super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long s=
tory short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented =
company. Might be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instea=
d: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, =
Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clini=

;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad we spoke the other day - I think =
I have a really good lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashins=
ky, the former editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at Wor=
ld 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti=
-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of =
the G100. They&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, C=
TO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast i=
nterviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights to share=
 across all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exact=
ly the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was much mo=
re practical than what he had considered (which was focused on interviewing=
 outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the =
other side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what =
their approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socia=
lize this internally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39=
;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources.=
 (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#3=
9;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull t=
ogether a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More critica=
lly, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon =
- I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this i=
dea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need=
 some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work proce=
ss breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=

br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic=
 cop&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group, decide=
 on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each group t=
o do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as we=
ll as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<br>&gt;=
