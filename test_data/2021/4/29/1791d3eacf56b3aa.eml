Kevin, Kellie,

Wanted to check in prior to our next call to see how the story gathering /
interviewing was going. Based on what we're seeing in the numbers + the
timing on the rollout we may be hitting a sweet spot for releasing an
article. My guess is if we aim for Memorial Day we'll be in the right place
at the right time.

I recently reconnected with a journalist friend who is BFF's with Adi
(Editor in Chief at HBR), so if we can get a draft to HBR in the next few
weeks I think we'll be right on track.

Let me know if you've got any updates and/or if we can help at all before
our next call; otherwise let's plan to dig in and outline a narrative
structure we can look to backfill with data and quotes!

- J
