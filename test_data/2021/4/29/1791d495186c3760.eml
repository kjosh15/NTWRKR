It's been a while - how are you and yours doing now that change is hitting
the gas?

I'm writing as indigometrics <http://www.indigometrics.com> is starting to
hit the "fun" part of the hockey stick and we're considering taking an
early stage investment. We've talked to several seed funders, angels, and
VCs, and I thought I'd ask you what your view was on family offices.

The reason you came to mind is that the product has shifted significantly
towards supporting, measuring, and managing I&D initiatives. Wharton's
People Analytics Team wants to do a white paper, and our lead client is
working on an HBR article about their use of it for I&D. We're sitting on
23 customers, 3 large multinationals, discussions with 4 new large
multinationals, and 10 more large multinationals in the pipeline. If we're
going to take funders, they're going to set the tone for the kind of
company we build over the long hauls - and now is that turning point.

Your insights have always been spot on and I don't know anyone who could
more quickly tell me if I'm looking in the right direction. Similarly, if I
can be of any help to anything you're working on, please let me know!

All best wishes,
Josh
