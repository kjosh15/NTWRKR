Josh,

I apologize if there is some confusion, to get domain indigometrics.com moved from the current Grid on this account to a new hosting plan on a new account, as well as the SSL and DNS settings transferred.  

First you need to chose a hosting plan, As we stated in prior responses. The best and cheapest option for you really is the Shared Hosting Deluxe plan which is $20.00 a month. That Shared Hosting Server does come / include the Cpanel access regardless. 

The only other option that is $20.00 a month is our Managed WordPress Ultimate Plan which is $20.00 a month, but you are only allowed to create/ have a WordPress site, which you said is not needed. 

Now to get your site moved to the new account on that Shared Hosting Plan, it is $100.00 for our Advanced Support team to handle.  Otherwise you could do it manually by those KnowledgeBase articles supplied previously. The turnaround time for our Advanced Support Team is usually 7-10 Business Days, and the move will include all of sites files and database information. The emails if there are any would still need to be migrated manually using Imap settings.

If you do not use the Grid for the email services then this would be void, if you do use the Grid for email services then this is the KnowledgeBase article for steps on how to migrate those emails: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204405444/how-do-i-migrate-email-between-servers-using-imap

So far the total cost would be $120.00 for the hosting and site move. 

Now on the SSL, if its tied to the Multi-Domain on this account we cannot transfer that over, you'd have to purchase a standard alone SSL  for it. Which is $75.00 a year or $120.00 for two years.

Lastly on the DNS settings, those do not usually carry over. They reset when you change over to the new Shared Server IP/DNS information. So any custom DNS settings you currently have in place would need to be manually inputted on the new Server. 

In summary, the total cost should be around $195.00. That is for all that has been mention, the new Hosting Plan, our Team handling the site move, as well as the new Stand alone SSL. Again the turnaround time for our team to do the site moves is about 7-10 Business Days.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to get the new account started. I would again need the below information and confirmation on what all you need added to it such as Hosting, Site Move, and the SSL. 

Company Name (if applicable)
Owner's Name (first and last name).
Billing Address (Street and Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country).
Email (please ensure this is accurate, as this is what the new account owner will use to sign in).
Phone number.

Best regards,
