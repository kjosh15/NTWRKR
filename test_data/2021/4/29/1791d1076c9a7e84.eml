We were connected waaaay back in 2010 by Adam L. Penenberg. Happy to tell
you about the CGM project (although the deck probably does a better job of
this), but am surprised you're not more curious about Indigometrics. I
would have thought that data analytics + shifting human behavior would have
been more interesting to you!
