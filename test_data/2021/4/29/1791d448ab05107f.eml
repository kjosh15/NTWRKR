Morgan,

Such a pleasure to reconnect yesterday; I'm thrilled to hear about the work
you're doing, and really really really appreciate your insights and advice
on Indigometrics! I've attached our overview deck, we've got a short video
at www.indigometrics.com, and if you like I'm happy to send you credentials
for our sandbox so you can kick the tires on the actual product.

If you know of a family office that might be interested we're keen to
connect, and in any case please do let me know if this is something you'd
be personally interested in. We've not finished structuring the pool of
investors yet (step 1: finalize the lead...) but I'd love to find some way
to have you involved.

Please do let me know if I can ever be of help to you or your ventures, and
I look forward to reconnecting soon!

All best wishes,
Josh
