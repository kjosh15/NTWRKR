Kate,

Thank you so much for such blisteringly clear analysis and insight on the
W50 call earlier today. I've been a special advisor to World 50 for quite
some time, and this was one of the more appreciably applicable calls I've
heard in a while!

As I was listening to you speak it made me realize that things have changed
significantly since I was last looking at board seats - especially around
Data, HR (esp. D&I), and Cyber - my areas of expertise.

Given my consulting work I have exposure to a wide variety of senior
executives across industries, but am not working in a large company (I'm
independent.) Do you or someone at your firm have time for a brief call to
see if we can be helpful to each other, or am I barking up the wrong tree?

Many thanks!!!
Josh
