Hey Josh!

Thanks for this update. We could aim for lower. Depending on how low you wan=
t to go we could go to ~150-175k if other parameters were set in place in th=
e contract phase. Want to give that a shot?=20

 want to share the message that they have a podcast, and care about the numb=

 requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it sound=
s like this might be an internal podcast; if it's only distributed to member=
s of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It'd be a private=
 link essentially. So, long story short, we aren't a data-driven company, we=
 are a service oriented company. Might be good to include some clients we've=
 worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon,=
 Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan=
, Cleveland Clinic and many more.=20

 bet he'd know exactly who to talk to at Microsoft about pitching a Future o=

 in this space specifically, but do have a pretty big department focused on t=
he topic. I also have Jordan Harbinger's agent who is tied into them so we c=
ould submit through multiple angles at once. <br><br>2. I can go to the foll=
owing companies (all very large) if you can help me qualify any of them:<br>=
	Blackrock<br>	HP<br>	Verizon<br>	Workday<br>	Google<br>=
	Mastercard<br>	Motorola<br>	IDEO<br>	Walmart<br>	Amazon<br><=
br>3. Crunchbase has a list of ~1000 recently funded, Small-to-Medium sized b=
usinesses sortable by the size of their recent raise. We could use this to m=

o targeting makes sense to you. In the meantime I am continuing to push W50.=
 <br><br>Otherwise, it seems like we could start with a direct pitch for a Fu=
ture of Work podcast pitch to Microsoft via Jaron and Jordan, and then try t=
o formalize a qualification process for the second and third options while i=
t progresses so we're ready to send a more bulk email when the show hits. Or=
 none or some of those options. What do you think?<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<=

br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode fo=
r a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all development (creativ=
e), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, producti=
on, post-production and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at t=
he level we do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work process, it v=
aries. However, I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work to=
gether to build and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the=
 World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be g=
iven opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gilded A=
udio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, includin=
g: development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipm=
ent, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our produc=
tion services work we don't distribute the shows, we don't even track number=
s really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different vendors (Di=
stributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put together a mark=
eting plan as well. However, we can strategize together on this and help get=
 this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive, so it requires=
 another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it sounds like th=
is might be an internal podcast; if it's only distributed to members of Worl=
d 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It'd be a private link ess=
entially. So, long story short, we aren't a data-driven company, we are a se=
rvice oriented company. Might be good to include some clients we've worked w=
ith instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washingt=
on Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Clevela=
nd Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chief of For=
tune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They're that group I've been on=
 retainer to as an "anti-McKinsey." They recently hugely expanded in size th=
rough a buyout of the G100. They're structured into interest/role groups - i=
.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a=
 podcast interviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights=
 to share across all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it w=
as exactly the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was m=
uch more practical than what he had considered (which was focused on intervi=
ewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on t=
he other side of a big restructuring, and aren't completely clear on what th=
eir approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socializ=
e this internally, and there is no guarantee they'll bite. There's also the r=
isk that they'll try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think=
 this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it's worth pitching to th=
em more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and A=
dam said that would be super helpful. More critically, I'm speaking to the n=
ew head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I've worked closely with him f=
or 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do y=
ou think? If you're game, I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture=
 podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # references for Gilde=
d.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=

ount of "traffic cop" work that would be required to interface with each gro=
up, decide on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of eac=
h group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an E=
P as well as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<b=
