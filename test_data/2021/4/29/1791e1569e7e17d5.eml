I don't suppose they're interested in measuring culture / behavior? We've
been developing a platform to produce statistical models of same so that
orgs can help staff align on core values, identify potential
safety/innovation/inclusion behavior gaps, and measure the efficacy of
their interal comms and L&D efforts. Let me know if that sounds interesting
at all, and glad to hear you're doing well!!

All best,
Josh
