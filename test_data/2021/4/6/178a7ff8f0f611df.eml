There is no one obvious avenue to approach here but we could set up stuff i=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thanks for all this! Funny you should mention Adam G=
rant as I&#39;m working closely with his People Analytics group at Wharton.=
<br>
<br>
Some quick followups:<br>
<br>
1. Do let me know if Dr. Hermundur has any other material to share, but don=
&#39;t stress about getting it to me in English. My wife is equally involve=
d in this effort and I like having material in Icelandic I want to understa=
nd in front of me.
<br>
<br>
2. For funding we&#39;re currently exploring a consortium of big companies =
to address D&amp;I through data (a longer conversation to be had there cert=
ainly!) If we fill all 8 seats we may not elect for funding at all (instead=
 funding via consortium investment), but
 in all likelihood we&#39;ll be looking for investment by this summer. <br>
<br>
So; if you have any introductions to make I&#39;d love to get them started =
now, before money is in hand, as it helps me vet if we&#39;re aligned on li=
ttle things like the purpose of the company, growth goals, etc. before they=
 have checks to write.<br>
<br>
3. Reg. introductions to funds, I&#39;m thinking specifically of helping in=
 connecting Icelandic companies to US funders/CVC/JV/corporate clients, etc=
. To your point, there&#39;s got to be a specific project out there where I=
 can deliver real value as part of the Icelandic
 ecosystem. My guess is that it will be in this space.<br>
<br>
4. Let me know when you&#39;re available to talk again; I&#39;m curious to =
hear the story about building resilience and grit - esp. if this is a data =
driven insight. Now that we&#39;re working with Wharton we have a lot of sc=
ientists wanting to test stuff on our platform...!<br>

Such a pleasure talking today - we didn&#39;t have time to get into it, but=
 one of the first things I did in the pandemic was to create an outreach ca=
mpaign to identify and reconnect with people who were strongly values led (=
and with whose values I shared). The
 goal was to create a broader network of very aligned connections and to re=
duce interactions with those who weren&#39;t motivated similarly. So I thin=
k we&#39;re looking to spend our time similarly.
<br>
<br>
1. Local school: please do send the framework you&#39;ve been working on lo=
cally and I&#39;ll use it to investigate the willingness of our incoming pr=
inciple to make changes. If we can make a role as that &quot;warm blanket o=
f support&quot; you mentioned this may be a good place
 to drive change.<br>
