Joshua,
  An article in the Wall Street Journal by James T Areddy:

China Creates Its Own Digital Currency, a First for Major Economy

A cyber yuan stands to give Beijing power to track spending in real time, pl=
us money that isn=E2=80=99t linked to the dollar-dominated global financial s=
ystem



A thousand years ago, when money meant coins, China invented paper currency.=
 Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally, in a re-imagination o=
f money that could shake a pillar of American power.

It might seem money is already virtual, as credit cards and payment apps suc=
h as Apple Pay in the U.S. and WeChat in China eliminate the need for bills o=
r coins. But those are just ways to move money electronically. China is turn=
ing legal tender itself into computer code.

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have foreshadowed a potential digital futur=
e for money, though they exist outside the traditional global financial syst=
em and aren=E2=80=99t legal tender like cash issued by governments.

China=E2=80=99s version of a digital currency is controlled by its central b=
ank, which will issue the new electronic money. It is expected to give China=
=E2=80=99s government vast new tools to monitor both its economy and its peo=
ple. By design, the digital yuan will negate one of bitcoin=E2=80=99s major d=
raws: anonymity for the user.

Beijing is also positioning the digital yuan for international use and desig=
ning it to be untethered to the global financial system, where the U.S. doll=
ar has been king since World War II. China is embracing digitization in many=
 forms, including money, in a bid to gain more centralized control while get=
ting a head start on technologies of the future that it regards as up for gr=
abs.

And it goes on.  I thought would be of interest to you. Note that it elimina=
tes what is often touted as one of bitcoin=E2=80=99s advantages - anonymity.=
 Instead, it gives the Chinese gov=E2=80=99t far more data re both its citiz=
ens spending and the economy as a whole.=20

Love,
DAD
