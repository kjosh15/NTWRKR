Will Gen X Women Rule the World?
--------------------------------

We'll see a lot of change in these new "roaring" twenties. The
roaring, though, may be the pace of that change rather than the
amount of fun everyone has.

I'm still counting on fun, personally.

One group that may be having more fun is women. That's because
they're gaining wealth faster than men, to the point that by 2030
women will own more than half the world's total wealth.

That's a bigger deal than you might think, according to Wharton
School professor Mauro F. Guill=C3=A9n. He highlights it as one of the
most important trends in his book 2030: How Today's Biggest
Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u6vekgw3tqhde642iv/6qhehoup6gw2q6u9/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzJQdWlmbGE=3D
):

These momentous trends spell massive changes not just for society
but also for capital markets, because women are different from
men when it comes to investing; for companies, because women
bring different perspectives to the workplace; and for
innovation, because women are increasingly becoming
entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneur part is especially interesting, as Generation X
is already the most entrepreneurial cohort. Plus, we're right at
the age where most successful businesses are started (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u6vekgw3tqhde642iv/kkhmh2u82qe973hk/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5jLmNvbS9qZWZmLWhhZGVuL25ldy1yZXNlYXJjaC11bmNvdmVycy1pZGVhb=
C1hZ2UtdG8tc3RhcnQtYS1idXNpbmVzcy5odG1s
):

Generally speaking, the study showed that a 50-year-old
entrepreneur was almost twice as likely to start an extremely
successful company as a 30-year-old, and a 40-year-old
entrepreneur was more than twice as likely to found a successful
startup as a 25-five-year-old, and a 60-year-old founder was
three times as likely to start a successful company as a
30-year-old.
This is good news for Gen Xers regardless of gender. But it
stands to reason that a lot of those businesses will be run by
Gen X women. And with the youngest of our tribe just entering
their 50s by 2030, that's a whole lot of productive time for an
economic shift due to our tough-as-nails ladies.

There's more. Women are doing more personal investing and wealth
management these days, and they tend to be better at it. As
Professor Guill=C3=A9n puts it, "The era in which most of the wealth
was generated by men, owned by men, and managed by men is nearly
over."

Women also spend money differently than men. They make
investments in education, healthcare, and insurance more readily,
and not just for themselves, but for their children and
grandchildren as well.

So is the fast increase in women=E2=80=99s wealth accumulation leading to
a large transformation of the economy? Absolutely. Remember that
spending on education, healthcare, and insurance account for
about 30 percent of the American economy. As women accumulate
more wealth over the next decade, those parts of the economy will
benefit from increased spending.
Men should welcome the shift to greater economic equality. It'll
certainly keep us from becoming complacent, and may lead to more
opportunities to find the right co-founder. Especially if they
have all the money, right?

And, not to put too fine a point on it, women tend to outlive men
by about seven years in the developed world. So if we're looking
to build wealth as opposed to simply passing it on to our better
halves, we guys need to take better care of ourselves.

Here's the main takeaway -- the shifts coming this decade will be
challenging for many. But if you understand the economic changes
that come with fewer babies being born, the graying of the
population, and the rising wealth of women (just to name a few),
you can make smart economic moves no matter what your gender.

We came home from school every day to an empty house and did our

Is Marijuana the Secret to Living a Long, Happy Life?
-----------------------------------------------------

By Trudi Roth

I recently attended a Clubhouse presentation where cannabis
industry experts discussed how to reach their most desired
audience, represented by a persona they called =E2=80=9CForest.=E2=80=9D In=
 her
early 40s, she lives in Portland, Oregon (where pot is legal) and
is busy raising kids, working full-time, and supporting her aging
parents.

Forest also has chronic back pain, insomnia, and anxiety, so
naturally, she=E2=80=99s perfect as a budding client. While much of the
conversation felt like blowing smoke, I loved that for once,
someone passed the dutchie to Gen X.

A recent study (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u6vekgw3tqhde642iv/l2heh6uov94kg8ag/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JkbWFya2V0aW5nLmNvbS9jb250ZW50LWh1Yi9uZXdzL2VhdC1kcmluay1hc=

) found that although we=E2=80=99re just 20% of the US population, we
account for 30% of lawful cannabis consumption. And a majority of
us (65%) are for legalizing it, not criticizing it. That said, as
natural skeptics, we=E2=80=99re smart enough to weed out the blunt truth

) about cannabis.

The ABCs of THC
---------------

First, the basics: cannabidiol (CBD) doesn=E2=80=99t get you high because
it=E2=80=99s non-psychotropic. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chemical
responsible for the psychological effects.

This is why currently hemp-based CBD is legal in all 50 states.
Only 36 states currently allow medical marijuana-based products,
and just 16 states and the District of Columbia have authorized
recreational pot use for adults.

Still, the flowering of the end of pot prohibition is lighting up
opportunities for us to revisit reefer. As epidemiologist William
Jesdale points out (

):

It=E2=80=99s easier to get and it=E2=80=99s also less stigmatized. With les=
s
punitive policies and just-say-no rhetoric, people who used in
their youth and may have stepped away might have come back, now
that it=E2=80=99s not Demon Weed anymore.
In fact, many see pot as a natural solution for various health
issues from chronic pain to tremors, inflammation, mental
afflictions (i.e., anxiety, depression, PTSD), glaucoma,
insomnia, and even cancer.

Unfortunately, this may be a half-baked assumption.

Disjointed Evidence
-------------------

While pot is often promoted as a miracle panacea, the empirical
evidence is pretty dank. That=E2=80=99s because marijuana has been
classified as a Schedule 1 narcotic since the Nixon White House,
complicating and limiting research.

Still, there is encouraging evidence (

) that cannabis helps relieve chemotherapy-related nausea, muscle
spasms from multiple sclerosis, some sleep disorders, and certain
kinds of chronic pain, albeit modestly. Other studies support (

) utilizing it to treat short-term depression and anxiety,
although continued use may worsen symptoms over time.

Plus, as we age and our metabolism slows, it=E2=80=99s important to
consider side effects (

), like dizziness, drowsiness, and interactions with other
medications. There=E2=80=99s a free cannabis-trained nurse hotline called

) if you have questions.

Still, there=E2=80=99s no need to think pot=E2=80=99s potential has complet=
ely
gone up in smoke. With cannabis decriminalized in almost all
states, it may be high time to explore if today=E2=80=99s grass is
greener than we remember it.

n twice as likely to found a successful startup as a 25-five-year-old, and =
a 60-year-old founder was three times as likely to start a successful compa=
ny as a 30-year-old.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"color:#333">This is good news for Gen Xers regardless of gender=
. But it stands to reason that a lot of those businesses will be run by Gen=
 X women. And with the youngest of our tribe just entering their 50s by 203=
0, that's a whole lot of productive time for an economic shift due to our t=
ough-as-nails ladies.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">There's more. Women are doing more personal investi=
ng and wealth management these days, and they tend to be better at it. As P=
rofessor Guill=C3=A9n puts it, "The era in which most of the wealth was gen=
erated by men, owned by men, and managed by men is nearly over."</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Women also spend money differently than men. They m=
ake investments in education, healthcare, and insurance more readily, and n=

. Remember that spending on education, healthcare, and insurance account fo=

 over the next decade, those parts of the economy will benefit from increas=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Men should welcome the shift to greater economic eq=
uality. It'll certainly keep us from becoming complacent, and may lead to m=
ore opportunities to find the right co-founder. Especially if they have all=
 the money, right?</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">And, not to put too fine a point on it, women tend =
to outlive men by about seven years in the developed world. So if we're loo=
king to build wealth as opposed to simply passing it on to our better halve=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Here's the main takeaway -- the shifts coming this =
decade will be challenging for many. But if you understand the economic cha=

(THC) is the chemical responsible for the psychological effects.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">This is why currently hemp-based CBD is legal in al=
l 50 states. Only 36 states currently allow medical marijuana-based product=
s, and just 16 states and the District of Columbia have authorized recreati=
onal pot use for adults. </p>
