 wanted to ask you about:<br><br>1. At the time you mentioned you were most=
ly focused on growing Marsbot. My contract work these days is mostly spent =
on retainer to senior executives of large multinationals, all of whom are s=
tarting to gear up looking for partnerships and platforms they can use to d=
ifferentiate. Is this worth a followup conversation?<br><br>2. I&#39;ve got=
 a startup built around metricing and managing corporate culture which has =
been blowing up since COVID+BLM (<a href=3D"http://www.indigometrics.com" t=
arget=3D"_blank">www.indigometrics.com</a>). We&#39;re about to look for a =
