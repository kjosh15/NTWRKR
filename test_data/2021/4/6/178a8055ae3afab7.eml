Back at you!! And yes, being a dad is hilarious, full stop. They're 5 and
8, both boys, and both way better people than their parents. ;)

We'll likely be in Iceland for another year or so. We landed on our feet in
a huge farmhouse with loads of land, wood burning stove, fiber internet,
etc. etc. Like yourself, having the space is a saving grace! Glad to see
you've been able to weather the pandemic in a good spot also... I agree,
pandemicing in NYC sounds nightmarish.

Most of my current projects are on www.josh.is, but I'm also pitching an
AI-led TV show w/ Microsoft, hosting a podcast for Accenture, and
continuing my retainer work to a private senior executive club called World
50. Most of my time is on www.indigometrics.com though, which thankfully is
suddenly profitable and growing well.

Keep me posted on *your* other stuff; I know you've always got cool
projects going as well!

All best,
Josh
