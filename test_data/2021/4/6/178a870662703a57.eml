fessor Mauro F. Guill=C3=A9n. He highlights it as one of the most important t=
rends in his book 2030: How Today's Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape t=
he Future of Everything:
>=20
> These momentous trends spell massive changes not just for society but also=
 for capital markets, because women are different from men when it comes to i=
nvesting; for companies, because women bring different perspectives to the w=
orkplace; and for innovation, because women are increasingly becoming entrep=
reneurs.
> The entrepreneur part is especially interesting, as Generation X is alread=
y the most entrepreneurial cohort. Plus, we're right at the age where most s=
uccessful businesses are started:
>=20
> Generally speaking, the study showed that a 50-year-old entrepreneur was a=
lmost twice as likely to start an extremely successful company as a 30-year-=
old, and a 40-year-old entrepreneur was more than twice as likely to found a=
 successful startup as a 25-five-year-old, and a 60-year-old founder was thr=
ee times as likely to start a successful company as a 30-year-old.
> This is good news for Gen Xers regardless of gender. But it stands to reas=
on that a lot of those businesses will be run by Gen X women. And with the y=
oungest of our tribe just entering their 50s by 2030, that's a whole lot of p=
roductive time for an economic shift due to our tough-as-nails ladies.
>=20
> There's more. Women are doing more personal investing and wealth managemen=
t these days, and they tend to be better at it. As Professor Guill=C3=A9n pu=
ts it, "The era in which most of the wealth was generated by men, owned by m=
en, and managed by men is nearly over."
>=20
> Women also spend money differently than men. They make investments in educ=
ation, healthcare, and insurance more readily, and not just for themselves, b=
ut for their children and grandchildren as well.
>=20
> So is the fast increase in women=E2=80=99s wealth accumulation leading to a=
 large transformation of the economy? Absolutely. Remember that spending on e=
ducation, healthcare, and insurance account for about 30 percent of the Amer=
ican economy. As women accumulate more wealth over the next decade, those pa=
rts of the economy will benefit from increased spending.
> Men should welcome the shift to greater economic equality. It'll certainly=
 keep us from becoming complacent, and may lead to more opportunities to fin=
d the right co-founder. Especially if they have all the money, right?
>=20
> And, not to put too fine a point on it, women tend to outlive men by about=
 seven years in the developed world. So if we're looking to build wealth as o=
pposed to simply passing it on to our better halves, we guys need to take be=
tter care of ourselves.
>=20
> Here's the main takeaway -- the shifts coming this decade will be challeng=
ing for many. But if you understand the economic changes that come with fewe=
r babies being born, the graying of the population, and the rising wealth of=
 women (just to name a few), you can make smart economic moves no matter wha=

.
>=20
> The ABCs of THC
> First, the basics: cannabidiol (CBD) doesn=E2=80=99t get you high because i=
t=E2=80=99s non-psychotropic. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chemical res=
ponsible for the psychological effects.
>=20
> This is why currently hemp-based CBD is legal in all 50 states. Only 36 st=
ates currently allow medical marijuana-based products, and just 16 states an=
d the District of Columbia have authorized recreational pot use for adults.
>=20
> Still, the flowering of the end of pot prohibition is lighting up opportun=
ities for us to revisit reefer. As epidemiologist William Jesdale points out=
:
>=20
> It=E2=80=99s easier to get and it=E2=80=99s also less stigmatized. With le=
ss punitive policies and just-say-no rhetoric, people who used in their yout=
h and may have stepped away might have come back, now that it=E2=80=99s not D=
emon Weed anymore.
> In fact, many see pot as a natural solution for various health issues from=
 chronic pain to tremors, inflammation, mental afflictions (i.e., anxiety, d=
epression, PTSD), glaucoma, insomnia, and even cancer.
>=20
> Unfortunately, this may be a half-baked assumption.
>=20
> Disjointed Evidence
> While pot is often promoted as a miracle panacea, the empirical evidence i=
s pretty dank. That=E2=80=99s because marijuana has been classified as a Sch=
edule 1 narcotic since the Nixon White House, complicating and limiting rese=
arch.
>=20
> Still, there is encouraging evidence that cannabis helps relieve chemother=
apy-related nausea, muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, some sleep disord=
ers, and certain kinds of chronic pain, albeit modestly. Other studies suppo=
rt utilizing it to treat short-term depression and anxiety, although continu=
ed use may worsen symptoms over time.
>=20
> Plus, as we age and our metabolism slows, it=E2=80=99s important to consid=
er side effects, like dizziness, drowsiness, and interactions with other med=
ications. There=E2=80=99s a free cannabis-trained nurse hotline called Leaf 4=

>=20
> Still, there=E2=80=99s no need to think pot=E2=80=99s potential has comple=

 are increasingly becoming entrepreneurs.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=

 50-year-old entrepreneur was almost twice as likely to start an extremely s=

han twice as likely to found a successful startup as a 25-five-year-old, and=
 a 60-year-old founder was three times as likely to start a successful compa=

<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=
(51,51,51)">This is good news for Gen Xers regardless of gender. But it stan=
ds to reason that a lot of those businesses will be run by Gen X women. And w=
ith the youngest of our tribe just entering their 50s by 2030, that's a whol=
e lot of productive time for an economic shift due to our tough-as-nails lad=
ies.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=
(51,51,51)">There's more. Women are doing more personal investing and wealth=
 management these days, and they tend to be better at it. As Professor Guill=
=C3=A9n puts it, "The era in which most of the wealth was generated by men, o=
wned by men, and managed by men is nearly over."</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=

 wealth accumulation leading to a large transformation of the economy? Absol=
utely. Remember that spending on education, healthcare, and insurance accoun=
t for about 30 percent of the American economy. As women accumulate more wea=
lth over the next decade, those parts of the economy will benefit from incre=
ased spending.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=
(51,51,51)">Men should welcome the shift to greater economic equality. It'll=
 certainly keep us from becoming complacent, and may lead to more opportunit=
ies to find the right co-founder. Especially if they have all the money, rig=
ht?</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=
(51,51,51)">And, not to put too fine a point on it, women tend to outlive me=

<p style=3D"font-family:source-sans-pro,helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:rgb=

e challenging for many. But if you understand the economic changes that come=
 with fewer babies being born, the graying of the population, and the rising=
 wealth of women (just to name a few), you can make smart economic moves no m=
atter what your gender.</p>
