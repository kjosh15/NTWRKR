Dear Josh Klein and Dear
Steve bond
Your crow project produced a huge impression on me. I and my friends are
makers and we like to invent \ make different projects with electronics,
which could be useful for people. Contact with such project as yours, give
an inspiration for guys like me to create and invent new projects.
Honestly, we want to invite you to Zoom or Skype, to discuss the idea of
interaction between crows and people with you.
In May there will be a conference of makers in my town. The idea of this
conference is smart and clean city. If we could contact you by Zoom or
Skype during this conference that would be delightfully. You could realize
the idea with crows in life, in my opinion it=E2=80=99s very difficult worl=
d-class
project, I think, you will produce a big effect for each conference
participant. So, I would like to suggest you to join us this forum in May
14 after noon for 10-15 minutes, to communicate and talk with my friends
about your project, we will be very grateful, if you find a time for us.
