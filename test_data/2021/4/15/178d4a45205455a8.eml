Hi Josh
Good to hear from you and apologies for the delay.  We=E2=80=99ve done a =
bit of a pivot in the business, though I hate that word!  We=E2=80=99ve =
moved from working with corporates as a bureau to instead supporting and =
working with speakers to plan and grow their speaking careers.  If =
you=E2=80=99d like any help in that regard then let me know would be =
delighted to assist.  Your projects are really relevant and timely, I am =
sure you will get a good uptake.=20

Kindest Regards
Maria
