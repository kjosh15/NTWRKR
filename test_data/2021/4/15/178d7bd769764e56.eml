Here=E2=80=99s a popular piece I did on PoMo.
Https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/?ep=3D028

Very briefly, it is the generally recognized background truth for the
mainstream academic humanities throughout the European Continent and most
of the Anglosphere, but it=E2=80=99s core claim is that there is no general=
ly
recognized background truth.

Also, a not very large critical mass of technologists who understood it
properly would be able to built tools far more relevant than Bitcoin and
Etherium because they would have better understanding of the concepts,
trust, contract, etc, which crypto is trying to produce solutions for.

To a very great extent, Iceland made a critical mistake in trusting the
outside world to the degree that it did.  The religion and philosophy of
the European continent are not superficial. They have a very specific
uncooperative agenda.

If you want to talk, let=E2=80=99s have a call. Text me at (610) 213-2487
