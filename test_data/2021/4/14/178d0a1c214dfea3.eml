there'd be a market for an oped about why this is a great idea. i was JUST =
reading this in Parents Mag:
"I didn't know nearing my 3-year-old sing for the first time would level me=
, in a good way, as much as it did. It's something he only did alone at fir=
st, when he didn't know we could hear and see him on the monitor-- he would=
 very sweetly and tunefully belt out, 'Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes' wit=
h hand movements. It was a private thing he did, and it was so nice to see =
that he had something that was just his."
EXCEPT IT WASN'T JUST HIS!!! He is living in a totalitarian, panopticon sta=
te and doesn't know it.
I have no idea if this upsets you the way it upsets me. I can't imagine gro=
wing up with my parents seeing what I was doing -- good or bad -- when I th=
ought I was alone.

 I had an idea for years about a platform in which you could track your kid=
s at any time - but each time you did it you have to write at least three s=
entences as to why. When the kid turns 16 he/she gets the records of each t=
ime, where they were, and what the parent wrote as to why. Think there'd be=
 a market?

Love to innovate. Maybe we can chew on a couple of ideas. One is that paren=
ts are encouraged to -- they practically have to opt out OF -- tracking the=
ir kids and being constantly available. I'm pretty sure that changes childh=
ood completely -- you are never truly trusted to be resourceful and respons=
ible. You don't get to see what you're made of when there's always an adult=
 ready to assist or intervene. Is there some tech way to scale back the chi=
ld-assisting tech? Tech that maybe only grants you three times you can call=
 your parents each month, or three times you can activate your phone to tra=
ck your kid (like a genie only provides 3 wishes)? That way parents would b=
e more mindful and kids would have less constant oversight?
Other topics: How do we get more schools to do the Let Grow Project, where =
kids are given the homework assignment, "Go home and do something new, on y=
our own"? Here's a 2-minute video of how much it can change kids (and paren=
ts) for the better. Kids are so anxious and passive. This is a great, FREE =
way to start breaking that shell!
How do we reverse engineer the societal notion that all kids are easily hur=
t and go through life broken, and therefore that it is best/kindest/most ev=
olved to view childhood through the lens of psychology -- always worrying a=
bout and discussing their feelings? And having THEM discuss their feelings?=
 It seems like we are so focused on sensitivity and fragility that we are i=
gnoring standard-issue resilience boosters kids come with, like bravery, fo=
rtitude, ignoring some pain, finding something else to do or love or think =
about... The same way we're getting kids into yoga and "mindfulness" and su=
ch -- techniques that adults may need because they don't climb trees or pla=
y night tag anymore -- we are making them into therapist chow.=C2=A0
And do you want to write about Moxie with me? I'm pretty down on the idea t=
hat a fake playmate is any kind of teaching tool for the real world of inte=
racting. Maybe if a child has special needs and the parent can't be helping=
 them as much as they need help -- but for regular kids? Or am I a grump wh=
o would probably have grumbled about the first See-n-Say or Tickle Me Elmo?=
 (Hint: I WAS an AM against Tickle Me Elmo.)

 of ideas. One is that parents are encouraged to -- they practically have t=
o opt out OF -- tracking their kids and being constantly available. I'm pre=
tty sure that changes childhood completely -- you are never truly trusted t=
o be resourceful and responsible. You don't get to see what you're made of =
when there's always an adult ready to assist or intervene. <b>Is there some=
 tech way to scale <i>back</i> the child-assisting tech? </b>Tech that mayb=
e only grants you three times you can call your parents each month, or thre=
e times you can activate your phone to track your kid (like a genie only pr=
ovides 3 wishes)? That way parents would be more mindful and kids would hav=
e less constant oversight?</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br clear=3D"none"></div><=
