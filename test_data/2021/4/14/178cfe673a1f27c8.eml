Hi Josh

Wonderful - thank you! Any chance that 12.30pm EST works for you? Otherwise
I can shift a few things and 1pm is also fine!

Looking forward to it!

All my best

v><div>Kehinde, why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope=
 of what you are thinking to get the conversation started. And if you don&#=
39;t mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the background if th=
at is alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFT=
s are a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I can =
help in any other way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0</di=

 him when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture framed =
of ourselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quot;e=
pitome of NY experience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the background an=
d everything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock so=
unds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#39;=
ve been working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for =
the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we rea=
lized we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#=
39; who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his sec=
urity wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I =
can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via=
 personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild we=
st ATM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries)=
 do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I c=
an do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, o=
r some other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much lo=
