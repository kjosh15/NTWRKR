Hi Josh
Nice to hear from you.
I'm in the middle of another campaign, running in the Democrtaic primary
for NYC Comptroller.
MCCforNY.com
If you know New Yorkers who you can bring together for a Zoom event to help
me raise money, that would be extremely helpful.
The first $250 of contributions from New Yorkers is potentially matched 8
to 1.
Meaning $250 could turn into $2250.
Let me know if you can bring together people who are concerned about the
direction of the city.
Thanks!
Michelle
