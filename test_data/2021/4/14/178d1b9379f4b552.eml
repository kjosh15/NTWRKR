my NFT Dream Team.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Josh, I know you house sa=
t for Kehinde, lord, almost 20 years ago, but I forget if you ever met pers=
onally. Thanks for assisting with this. Rosie, who is also cc&#39;d here is=
 Kehinde&#39;s studio manager. Obviously, Kehinde has the vision for this a=
nd will connect the dots for you as far as the idea, number of NFTs, form, =
etc... As you mention in your email (pertinent text below), letting everyon=
e know how selling through different formats works, and since you mention t=
he Wild West any specific risks or restrictions associated with each format=
 would help too.</div><div><br></div><div>Kehinde and Rosie, I have known J=
osh since high school. You can find his resume at=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://w=
ww.josh.is/" target=3D"_blank">https://www.josh.is/</a> if you are interest=
ed. He has been at the forefront of various waves of technology for a few d=
ecades now,=C2=A0just look at his client list. I also can&#39;t resist addi=
ng his crow vending machine Ted talk: <a href=3D"https://www.ted.com/talks/=

><div><br></div><div>Kehinde, why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vi=
sion and scope of what you are thinking to get the conversation started. An=
d if you don&#39;t mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the ba=
ckground if that is alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock m=
ainly, and NFTs are a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me =
know if I can help in any other way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- S=
cott=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div><i>Email: We do indeed know Kehinde; we=
 house-sat for him when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a p=
icture framed of ourselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39=
;s our &quot;epitome of NY experience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the=
 background and everything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work=
; Blackrock sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing i=
s good. I&#39;ve been working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch =
of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a =
while - we realized we were on the right track when he had to rescue a frie=
nd of theirs&#39; who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he =
set up his security wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely t=
o sell NFTs I can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wan=
ts to sell via personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very mu=
ch the wild west ATM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators =
(or galleries) do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know=
 what else I can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, =
New Orleans, or some other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<=
br><br>Much love back at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>=
