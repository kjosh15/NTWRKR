 in your email (pertinent text below), letting everyone know how selling th=

iv>Kehinde, why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope of =
what you are thinking to get the conversation started. And if you don&#39;t=
 mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the background if that i=
s alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs ar=
e a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I can help=
 in any other way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0</div><d=

 when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture framed of o=
urselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quot;epito=
me of NY experience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the background and ev=
erything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock sounds=
 amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve b=
een working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the =
Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we realize=
d we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#39; =
who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his securit=
y wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can =
certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via per=
sonal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild west A=
TM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!=
<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I can d=
o to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or so=
me other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love b=
