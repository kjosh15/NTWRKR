Excellent! Nicely phrased, and I love how you emphasize that the socially
conscious element is important.

Two things I'd change; 1. I think you could combine the second and third
sentences in the second paragraph to be clearer. 2. Make the last paragraph
a clear question. Are you asking her if she's offering shares, how much she
thinks you should be paid, or... ? If you like, one approach could be
"Could we start with $25/hr and reassess in the fall to see if I can commit
more time and/or if shares become a possibility?" or something like that.

Exciting opportunity, Hulda - and nicely handled with the followup and
articulation of values!

xoxo,
Josh
