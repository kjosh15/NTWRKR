Looks like as long as the US doesn't make it onto the "red list" you should
be able to present your vaccination record, take a test, and then
quarantine until your results arrive. I'd double check that the place you
rented qualifies for quarantine, and if not plan to spend the first night
in a quarantine hotel (which is free, anyway!)

Love,
Josh
