Now that I'm using an Icelandic SIM it looks like my invite didn't go
through. Can you send one to my local # at +354.655-3925?

All best and much obliged,
Josh

P.S. Weirdly, I did a TV spot once which required that I assemble an entire
Model T from parts, and then drive one around for a couple hours. Super
weird now that changing your car's oil requires a graduate degree and a
bank of specialized microcomputers.
