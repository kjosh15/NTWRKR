Can you read over?

Very exciting, and no worries, I know your schedule is crazy. I like the
philosophy of "anything we can accomplish is better than nothing,"
especially given that it's a socially conscious company. We need companies
like these in the world and that's a real driver for me to be a part of it.

This is a great fit for me. Something you should know is that I'm applying
to an Occupational Therapy program - if I get in I'll be starting full time
school in the fall. Mostly attending remotely which feels like would be
supportive to my work with you if I take this position with your company,
however we'd need to be mindful of the position not being able to grow
beyond my capacity in the fall. We could start with the current schedule
and I can be a part of accelerating the company's growth over the summer
and reassess hours mid September.

Naming a price is tricky with the small number of hours to start with. I
don't know what sort of funding you have or if shares are a part of the
conversation.
