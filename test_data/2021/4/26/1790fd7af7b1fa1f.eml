Yeah I searched email had been a very long time since we corresponded.  I
was at 3rd Ward in Brooklyn.  Is that where we met?

Were you involved in this?

Continuous Glucose Monitoring seems interesting.  Tim Ferris was doing this
years ago and now I have friend who recently sent me info from study where
they tracked 50k meals and blood sugar response.  Was doing keto for year
and half.  Now off the wagon and eating ice-cream and beer.

As for me doing podcasts and livestream for IBM:
