I'm arranging to help an artist get rolling with them, and will be
consulting to a bunch of CMOs on the topic in an upcoming Clubhouse. A good
friend is doing the back end security work for NiftyGateway, so I get to
hear a lot about what the Winklevii are doing... it's an interesting time
for NFTs!

Let me know how I can help,
Josh
