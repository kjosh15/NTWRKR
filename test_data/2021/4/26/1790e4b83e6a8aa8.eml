Just checking back in. If you didn't see, Bitcoin recently took a beating
<https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin> but is already rallying again
(same for Etherium <https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum>), so it's not
a bad time to dip a toe into crypto. Let me know where you stand on the NFT
project!
