Excellent news!! Spring is springing (??) here also, although it's def.
colder than anywhere else I've lived - we've still got snow on the lawn.
Our crows disappeared as soon as the geese started migrating inland,
assumedly b/c loads of them are getting hit by cars and its' a fucking
corvid feast out there. They'll be back, I trust.

What did you think of Rodion's invite? I'm pretty booked up trying to
recover from losing half my annual income two years running now, plus
building a company that's growing fast. Def. want to support is efforts if
you think he's in the right direction, though! Thoughts?
