Hi Josh-

Great to hear from you!

Wow- it sounds like you have been doing some amazing work and that there
are some incredible things happening.  Can't wait to dive in and learn
more, Josh.

I have some updated info on New Leaf to send you-- and am almost complete
on a self-assessment checklist that will help me get a grasp of your
speaking work and see if there may be a match for your needs and New Leaf's=
.

I will have my amazing assistant Jess send through the 2 page overview on
New Leaf and I will send the checklist assessment early next week.  If you
have a moment to fill it in, that would be amazingly helpful.

From there, I would love to set up a time to chat on Zoom.

Sound good?
Warmly,
Amy
