Do you know anyone that might want to run one? I have a series of banks in
S. America that need someone to test their infrastructure (not penetration,
just an initial overview w/suggested next steps). Any recommendations
appreciated.

Otherwise, I hope you're well! I'm still in Iceland, smoking reindeer and
learning about more new kinds of snow and ice than I ever knew existed. At
least my startup <http://www.indigometrics.com> is growing well - let me
know if you've got any large multinationals keen in using data to solve for
DE&I!

All best and much obliged,
Josh
