I'll set up an offer for the life insurance but can't give you the price ju=
st yet.

Concerning the questions about accident insurance in the F+ packages. First=
 of all we're not talking about over all accident insurance but leisure acc=
ident insurance and so my answers are based on that.

a) Let's say that you have the F+3 package. The maximum insurance amount fo=
r disability is 33.153.000 ISK. The amount is based on the disability you w=
ould be assessed for.

b)The benefit period is 46 weeks, waiting time 6 weeks. So if you would be =
unable to work for a longer period than 6 weeks you'd receive benefits dail=
y - ISK 27.000 a day.

c)The premium for just this part of the insurance is ISK 16.099. Exemption =
from premium is not offered in F+

d)The monthly cost really depends on the rest of the package because this l=
eisure accident insurance is included in the packages 2-4.

e)Each category is differently priced. F+4 has the highest insurance amount=
 and the lowest deductible, and therefor the most expensive one. F+1 does n=
ot offer the leisure accident insurance and so the F+2 has the lowest insur=
ance amount and the highest deductible.

Hopefully this gives you a more clear image of our F+ leisure accident insu=
rance and please let me/us know if you have more questions or if anything w=
as misunderstood :)

Kind regards,

Subject: Followup Questions
I wanted to follow up on these questions:


1) In regards to your Life Insurance policy:

a. Your agent said "You can choose the amount yourself, and what controls w=
hat you pay for the insurance is your age, the amount that you want to be i=
nsured. There is just one policy for life insurance."
Right now I have a US Life Insurance policy for $500,000 USD which costs $1=
30.27 USD every 3 months. I am 46 years old; what would your policy cost to=
 insure for a similar amount?


2) In regards to the Accident Insurance:

a. It looks like the FPlus plans cover quite a bit more than just disabilit=
y, but that for disability payments you give between 24,000,000 - 50,000,00=
0 ISK. Is that amount a yearly payout or a total amount?

b. How long is the maximum benefit period?

c. Is there a premium, and if so under what conditions may it be waived?

d. What is the monthly cost? Can you give me a range?

e. Finally, the list at https://vis.is/samanburdur-a-f-plus-fjolskyldutrygg=
ingum/ seem to include four different "families" of insurance (F plus 1, F =
plus 2, F plus 3 and F plus 4), but under these are twelve different catego=
ries of coverage. Does each "family" include all the different categories i=
n one fee or plan, or is each category a differently priced offering?
