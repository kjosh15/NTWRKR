A few quick items:

a) Crowberry: I may have found a lead seed-stage investor ($1-1.5mm). They
want a pitch from the two of us in a week or two for their new fund, due to
close in a month or two. They're be happy to lead it, but would need an
angel or two to follow on. They also have good relationships with US-based
VCs (they've done some investments with Andreessen Horowitz, Menlo
Investors, and others) if a Series A or B makes sense later. Let's discuss
tomorrow.

b) We should move Indigometrics.com to its own hosting plan so Lachlan can
admin, etc. This is an annual $200 fee and a weekend of work on my end, but
it'll move the domain out of my personal plan, which we should do
regardless. How do I expense?

c) Similarly, MediaTemple has a Google Workspace package for ~$25/month
which I think we should launch at least in the short term so we can
coordinate calendars, Loreley can start on docs, etc. while we wait for her
laptop to arrive. Again, let me know where to charge it and I'll get this
turned on.

d) Separately, I have a call scheduled with Kevin and his media person to
start work on the HBR article. Let me know if you're planning to attend -
happy to run it myself, but we'll want to revert to discuss data at some
point.

All best,
Josh
