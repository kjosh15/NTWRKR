 For example, we can hold the keys virtually while the NFT goes live, and th=

usly, Kehinde has the vision for this and will connect the dots for you as f=
ar as the idea, number of NFTs, form, etc... As you mention in your email (p=
ertinent text below), letting everyone know how selling through different fo=
rmats works, and since you mention the Wild West any specific risks or restr=

 I also can't resist adding his crow vending machine Ted talk: <a href=3D"ht=

 idea of the vision and scope of what you are thinking to get the conversati=
on started. And if you don't mind, I would love to stay on the email thread i=
n the background if that is alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black=
 Rock mainly, and NFTs are a space I have been curious about too. Equally, l=
et me know if I can help in any other way too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><di=
v>- Scott&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Email: We do indeed know Kehinde=
; we house-sat for him when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a=
 picture framed of ourselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It's o=
ur "epitome of NY experience" photo, with a bagel shop in the background and=
 everything. ;) Glad to hear he's still doing great work; Blackrock sounds a=
mazing.<br><br>If he'd like to connect his timing is good. I've been working=
 with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss t=
wins and we'd been predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were on the r=
ight track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs' who had his credentials=
 on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!<br><br>If Kekin=
de wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can certainly help, although h=
e ought to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand, gallery, or re=
seller first. It's very much the wild west ATM so he's wise to get ahead of i=
t before regulators (or galleries) do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us direct=
ly, and let me know what else I can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you a=
gain in Iceland, New Orleans, or some other place in the year ahead for a pr=
oper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love back at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><div><br>=
