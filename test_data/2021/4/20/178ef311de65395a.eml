Well that's serendipitous - I was just asked to hold a Clubhouse session
about NFTs in May for a group of current and former CMOs from companies

It's through World 50, a "private community for senior-most executives" I'm
on retainer to.

bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs =

a friend of theirs&#39; who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen becau=

he wants to sell via personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s v=
