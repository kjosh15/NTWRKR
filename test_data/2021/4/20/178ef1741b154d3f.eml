GoDaddy is one of the biggest resellers of domain names. It's likely that
the person who bought it used their anonymity service, hence the records
coming up empty. You could contact GoDaddy to ask them about selling it,
but I'm unsure of how/if they'll put you through. :/

Know that's not much help, sorry! How about www.TheRealRupertFriend.com?
