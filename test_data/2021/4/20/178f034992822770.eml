Hey Mollie,

Prior to our call I wanted to hit you with an update on the latest PR stuff
I've got going. Let me know if any of these might help us work together,
and otherwise I'm looking forward to our call - lots of other projects are
bearing fruit!

   - Firstly, I'm the cohost of Built for Change
   <https://link.chtbl.com/accenture>, a big new podcast by Accenture,
   made in collaboration with T Brand Studio at the New York Times. This is
   their biggest push in this space this year, and they're advertising it
   heavily on The Daily and other NYT podcasts. I've been assured it's not
   unreasonable to expect it to be in the Top 20 of the Apple Podcasts'
   Business category!

   - Secondly, my startup, Indigometrics.com <http://indigometrics.com/>,
   is about to get a bunch of new press; one of our biggest multinational
   customers is developing a Harvard Business Review article, and Wharton's
   People Analytics team is talking with us about publishing a white paper =
on
   it. At the same time, many of our newer customers are starting to manage
   their Diversity and Inclusion efforts with our platform... because they =
can
   cite our statistics as part of their PR. The upshot is that the *Future
   of Work* is a bright new platform for speaking - and one which is
   strongly aligned with a company I'm invested in!

   - Lastly, there's been a wonderful upsurge of activity as vaccinations
   spread around the world. I've been a mentor for SXSW, a special technolo=
gy
   advisor to World 50, have participated in war game exercises with a
   consortium of US intelligence community members, and more. See the
   attached, updated presskit for all the latest, and as always videos, pre=
ss,
   and reference work is available at www.josh.is.

Things are starting to really pick up as we get deeper into 2021. I'm
looking forward to riding the wave with you!

All best,
Josh Klein
