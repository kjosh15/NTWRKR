Hey Josh,

Thanks for saying hi! It's always great to hear from you.

I've been busy putting machine learning in to distributed databases at my
company, Era. We recently raised our Series A:
https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/20/log-management-database-startup-era-software-raises-15-25m/

One thing that has surprised me, as we've grown to twenty salaried
employees, is how much capital-c Culture matters. Before starting the
company, I didn't have a visceral appreciation of Culture's importance,
probably because I was a solo engineer. Lately, I find myself earnestly
talking about humility, generosity, first-principles-thinking, and our
other values -- no longer just "engineering talk".

What's the story with that glucose monitor? It sounds useful and
interesting, as a data geek!

Best,
Robert
