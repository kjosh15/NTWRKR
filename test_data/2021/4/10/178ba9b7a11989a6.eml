Hello, this is Rodion. I wrote to you in the summer about crows, remember?
Sorry for not writing for a long time, I was very busy with the project.
While I went back to the city to study, the birds went through the second
stage of training, they took peanuts from the device. Thanks, your advice
helped.

Now I'm working on a neural network, I already have a network that detects
butts and opens the device, but this is only a demo version. I also began
to make a model of my own device for training on cigarette butts. This is
really very interesting. Recently I put the device back in the city, and I
am waiting for the crows to come again. What is your lot?

I recently came across another person who teaches corvids. You may have
heard of him, this is Hans Forsberg (
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA). He managed to
train forty to assemble metal lids. And I think he also wants to start
collecting cigarette butts. Have you seen him?

If you're interested, here's my neural network video -
https://fb.watch/4N1Uptgr84/. It is in Russian, but part of the video on
the neural network can be understood without words)

Seen your latest YouTube videos, it's great.

Respectfully yours, Rodion.
