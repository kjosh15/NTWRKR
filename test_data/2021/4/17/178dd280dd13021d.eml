It=E2=80=99s not just crypto. Modern governments and societies are built on=
 a
social tech stack. game theory, decision theory, cybernetics, etc. those
are built on natural law and other softer humanistic theories. The latter
can be taught without prior foundations, but that requires good
storytelling and empathy by the person explaining. Otherwise it=E2=80=99s j=
ust
lists of facts.

If it=E2=80=99s possible for them to become oriented, boys won=E2=80=99t be=
 in trouble.
Without that they literally need to fall back on sexual orientation, a
radically nihilistic alternative to what people a century ago would have
referred to as =E2=80=98meaning=E2=80=99 before Stalinism taught them to em=
brace
=E2=80=98absurdism=E2=80=99.

The tragedy is that their lives could be so incredibly much richer if we
were able to understand the situation they are in. Iceland is independent
enough that it could be a city upon a hill if it understood, for instance,
the considerations which lead the UK to leave the EU, and achieve
vaccination rates far higher than those achieved by the rest of the
continent.
