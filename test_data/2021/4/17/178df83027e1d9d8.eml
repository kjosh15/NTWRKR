Hey all, I wanted to update you that Google Workspace is up and running.
We'll probably want to tweak stuff as we go, so keep me posted - Lachlan,
I've made your account admin so you can assist on this.

The only bell/whistle I installed was CNAME routing; you can go to the
following URLs and be routed directly to Indigometric's instances of the
relevant service:

cal.indigometrics.com
mail.indigometrics.com
docs.indigometrics.com
groups.indigometrics.com
sites.indigometrics.com

*At this point please:** a) log in and change your password, and b) enable
2FA - see: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839
<https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839>*

Let me know if you have any questions; I'll be migrating repeating meetings
and such onto the cal as we go!

- J

P.S. Who's in charge of checking the info@ account? Let me know and I'll
pass you the login credentials!
