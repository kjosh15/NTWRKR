*TL;DR: Indigometrics is doing the basics for growth, with some exciting
accelleration about to hit.*
Welcome to summer!! If you're interested in talking about NFTs, using
Iceland as a market test bed, or Human Analytics I'm your man.

Otherwise Indigometrics has hired its first three folks, we're learning a
TON from our first really challenging rollout, and we're trying to gauge
what the impact of an HBR article and Wharton Whitepaper will be on our
sales pipeline. While that's happening, we're in discussions with four
large multinationals, any one of which could sign on and solve our
short-term cash flow issues. *If you've got thoughts on how to maximize the
results of good press, let me know!*

Meanwhile I'm keeping the wheels on the bus with the new Built for Change
<https://link.chtbl.com/accenture> podcast for Accenture, made in
collaboration with T Brand Studio at the New York Times. I'm also looking
at helping a big fine artist (he painted Obama) explore NFTs, and with
Business Iceland to help them pitch Iceland as a test bed for large
companies.

All interesting stuff - the technological revolution of the last ten years
is peanuts compared to what we're *starting* to go through now. Very
exciting times - let me know how/if I can help you in your own navigations
of our crazy near future!

All best,
Josh
