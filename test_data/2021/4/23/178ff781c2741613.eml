Harris,

As per our last conversation, please find an overview deck attached, and a
short summary video available here <http://www.indigometrics.com>. You can

My biggest question for you is how you'd suggest we optimize the upcoming
HBR article on how one of our biggest clients (a construction firm of >50k
employees) is using us for Diversity and Inclusion, and a pending
whitepaper and associated HBR whitepaper from Wharton's People Analytics
team. We're starting to build out our skills matrix for our advisory board,
which ought to help put us in a better position vis a vis optics around D&I
prior to publishing.

Other than that I am continuing to see interesting stuff around the project
we worked on - let me know if you'd like me to send you stuff I find as I
don't want to spam you otherwise!

All best,
Josh
