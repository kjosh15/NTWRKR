John,

Thanks for the consideration here; I've sent an invite for 1pm EST on the
30th. If you need to adjust let me know what your calendar allows.

I'm having a number of conversations (including with some large potential
new clients as well as potential investors here in Iceland) before our call
which ought to inform the conversation - very much looking forward to it!!

- J
