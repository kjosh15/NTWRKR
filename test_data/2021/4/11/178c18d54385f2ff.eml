You ok if I ask Michael at BSS if/how they could help amplify any press we
could get from the HBR piece / Wharton white paper? I ask as I expect him
to either suggest some contacts, defer, or ask for $$... or try using the
platform again. I think that latter is least likely but wanted to clear
with you.

Thoughts?
