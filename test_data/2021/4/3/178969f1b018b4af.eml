C-Side is a current events program that uses the world's most advanced
artificial intelligence, comedically housed in a mammoth robot named C, to
show Americans the human side of the issues which divide them most.

Through a dialogue box on the show's mobile app and website, our AI robot
will continuously discuss the most contentious topics of our time with
thousands of opinionated viewers simultaneously, attempting to coax them
into empathizing with another perspective.

Then, on the program each week, C and a cohost will discuss the robot's
conversations with viewers. The highlights of those chats - the unexpected
successes, the unanticipated arguments, the bizarre but effective lines of
reasoning - act as a mirror onto the absurd and deeply human nature of our
beliefs *as they actually are*.

Using theatrics and comedy, C will then select a few of their most
intriguing conversations from the past week and use guests or the viewers
themselves to re-enact the chats. C will even at times be dispatched to
visit viewers in their homes and communities across America, offering
surreal, comedic, and even endearing portraits of life behind American
divisiveness.

# A unifying robot

Today, the US is divided over innumerable issues; how to approach
immigration, what to do about climate change, whether to overhaul US
healthcare, and who should govern the nation. Race, sex, gender, and even
bathrooms have become hubs for shouting matches.

But what if we could, through technology, talk *to ourselves* - as a
country? What if an AI educated itself on polarizing topics by listening to
both sides' best arguments, and then debated with the most ardent fanatics
- all to convince them otherwise? Would we learn to listen to each other
better... or simply see our own absurdities in stark relief?

By being able to analyze and learn, at scale, C_Side aims to provide a
narrative for how Americans can re-engage with each other. Because it is
unbiased, it will reflect the all-too-human absurdities of our arguments,
providing the clearest mirror to our own beliefs.

Visually, C will be a heaving robot reminiscent of 1990's sci-fi. But
intellectually, C can be the voice of the nation, offering insights drawn
from who we actually are, rather than who we want to believe each other to
be.

All best,
