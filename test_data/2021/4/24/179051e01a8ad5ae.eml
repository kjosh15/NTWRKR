Hey dude! I finally got around to watching Rodion's video. I was excited
that he used the core Crowbox platform and kind of hot-rodded it for his
experiment. We'll see how he does!

One of the farm cats that roams all of the prairies around here ate some
small animal in our firepit area which is directly south of our house. He
left a pile of intestines and what looked like a liver.

Eli the dog kept going back to this area to sniff the guts, and I kept
forgetting to pick them up. Anyway, this morning we're watching TV and I
see a crow fly over our prairie that's south of the house, 50 or 75 feet
up. I thought "cool, another crow" then about 30 seconds later a dark form
dropped from the sky directly south of our house. So I went and looked out
the window and a raven of some sort (its beak was fairly tall, and it was a
big bird) had landed in the firepit area and starting collecting the guts.

So, it appears that this guy was flying over, saw the guts and thought
"yummers" and swooped back around and landed to collect them. This means a
couple of neat things. Firstly, that the corvids I see flying over are
indeed scanning the surface of our property for food items. It also means
that, at least in this case, the corvid wasn't too shy to land somewhat
near the house to collect the food.

This might mean that my Firepit area is a good place to deploy a Crowbox. I
think I should put a little platform up and place some peanuts and see
whether I can get the firepit onto the corvids' regular foraging route.

How are things? I kind of went dark on you there for a bit. Spring is
looking pretty awesome here!

-Steve
