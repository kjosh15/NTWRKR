Hi Guys! Very cool work, Rodion. We're both very pleased to see that
someone has taken the Crowbox platform and modified it for a different
experiment. I look forward to hearing more about your project. And as Josh
says, let us know if you have any questions or if there is a way we could
help.

-Steve
