Hey Josh,

Apologies for my late response. Thanks for reaching out :) Sure -- would
appreciate a call to touch base to learn more about we're both up to.

I have good availability in the afternoons. Anytime between 1 PM - 4 PM ET
would work well for me until the end of the week. Let me know what works
for you and which number to reach you at.

Best regards,
Stephen McCarthy
