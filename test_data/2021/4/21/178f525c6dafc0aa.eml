Three salient things:

1. I'm working with a pretty big artist (he painted a president?) on his
NFT deployment, so if you need anyone to explain the ins and outs I'm now
qualified. As usual my take is a little weird as I've been doing some work
with the US Intelligence community and have some close friends who are
working on some of the bigger platforms. Either way, I'm SUPER curious what
CAA is doing in this space and if they realize how much firepower they
could get out of it.

2. I cobbled together a serendipity engine that emails folks I've spoken to
and generates scaled network effects. I think there may be a book there b/c
it's about how anyone can leverage their network to make a bigger, better,
more sustainable one... and in our newly highly-virtualized world that's a
pretty big area of interest. My description is crap, however, hence my
wanting to get your expert eye on the concept.

3. I was curious to catch up vis a vis past published works.

Let me know if it's worth your time to catch up on 1 &/or 2, and if we
could/should chat about #3.

All best,
Josh
