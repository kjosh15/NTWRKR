Got it. Thanks for the insight - and the advocacy!

I'm (reasonably) flexible around terms, but if it doesn=E2=80=99t include a
percentage it's going to be hard to stay aligned given all the
opportunities and resources that are related to the space - tying in my
executive clients, leveraging contacts in crypto, doing an unknown quantity
of marketing/technology expansion advising, etc.

There's just a ton of ways to develop the platform to support Kehinde here,
and if we=E2=80=99re all pushing to make it the best sale possible it=E2=80=
=99s easy to
invest across the board.

Anyway, that's my rambling response. Really appreciate you connecting us
and I do hope something works out - we=E2=80=99ll see what Rosey comes back=
 with!
