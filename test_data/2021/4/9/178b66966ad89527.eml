Robert,

Firstly, thanks again for the intro to Ester. She connected me to Karl
Gu=C3=B0mundsson of Islandsstofa which was a huge help.

In the meantime, I just spoke to the head of BP's R&D/CVC branch,
Launchpad, and they'd like to see a deck for Icewind. No promises,
obviously, but I described what I knew of the company and he said it was an
area they were keen to grow. Let me know if that's ok and if so if you have
a deck I can forward!

Many thanks,
Josh
