hello Josh.
it has been a strange year indeed.  I've managed to weather it, along with
others in my close orbit.
I trust you have as well.
as things begin to open up, perhaps some of the things I've been developing
will find traction with funders.
IndigoMetrics sounds interesting, and terrifying.  the notion that a deep
learning algorithm knows who is happy and who isn't has so much potential.
and like all new technology, pretty much since fire, it's a double edged
sword.
have you watched The One, or Made for Love?
https://www.netflix.com/title/80199029
https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYFE2Tg8P-76tMQEAAAAS
the planet is of course our most pressing problem - the destruction we've
caused across all aspects of our ecosystem will very quickly make Covid
seem like child's play.
I'm slowly working on a doc about a relative - Mezz Mezzrow.
https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-mighty-mezz-marijuana-and-the-beat-generation/
thanks for checkin in.
Tod
