Hi Josh

No rush at all, let=E2=80=99s just keep chatting
We have a few months still to launch this new company. Happening in =
July. I think then I could introduce you to them.=20

They really want to change the way that they are perceived around the =
world. In order to do this they need to make sure everyone in the =
company believes in the same purpose.

Looking forward to catching up again soon.

Cheers

Rob
