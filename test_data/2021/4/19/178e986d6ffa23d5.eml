Rosey,

It strikes me that the best way to market Kehinde=E2=80=99s NFT is probably=
 a drop
auction. That=E2=80=99s where you tell people some time in advance that the=
 NFT
will be becoming available, and when it =E2=80=9Cdrops=E2=80=9D it immediat=
ely goes to
auction.

That approach would let you leverage your own mailing lists, galleries'
member lists, and online followers to drum up interest prior to the NFT
becoming available - which both generates more press and increases the
likely end sale price.

This approach lets you begin the process immediately - we would be setting
up your accounts while prepping for the drop and building and marketing the
NFT. Let me know if that sounds right to you.

- J

onversation started. And if you don&#39;t mind, I would love to stay on the=
 email thread in the background if that is alright, to see how this unfolds=
 and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs are a space I have been curious abou=
t too. Equally, let me know if I can help in any other way too.=C2=A0</div>=
<div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div><i>Email: We do =
indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him when we first moved to NYC (thank=
s to you!) and have a picture framed of ourselves of a day we took his dogs=
 out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quot;epitome of NY experience&quot; photo, w=
ith a bagel shop in the background and everything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s=
 still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like =
to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve been working with a friend who is c=
urrently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been=
 predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were on the right track when =
he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#39; who had his credentials on a $200k=
 NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants t=
o get set up securely to sell NFTs I can certainly help, although he ought =
to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand, gallery, or reseller =
first. It&#39;s very much the wild west ATM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead o=
f it before regulators (or galleries) do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us di=
rectly, and let me know what else I can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see=
 you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or some other place in the year ahead f=
or a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love back at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><=
