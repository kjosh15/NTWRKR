Thanks, Phillip!

Jeffrey, pleased to meet you back!

Your timing on this one couldn=E2=80=99t be better - I=E2=80=99m currently =
helping a pretty
big-name fine artist (he painted a US president) figure out his approach to
selling NFTs, and another good friend has been doing back-end work on the
Winklevoss twin=E2=80=99s latest NFT platform, so I=E2=80=99ve got plenty o=
f insights to
share.

As for absolving NFTs of absurdity... well, let=E2=80=99s not reach *too* f=
ar. But
demystifying them, sure! When are you thinking, how big of a group, and
comprised of what invitees?

Thanks for thinking of me - looking forward to a fun (and enlightening)
conversation!

- J
