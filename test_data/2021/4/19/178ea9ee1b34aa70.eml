Hey all,

Wanted to follow up to say Vicki sent me the deck you put together and it
looks... amazing. You've got one of the most comprehensive and
deeply-looking processes I've seen yet; it's super exciting to think about
what you could bring to a nascent brand like Indigometrics!!

As mentioned, we're signing on some big new growth but haven't stepped over
that line yet, so will keep you posted. In the meantime, let me know if the
client you mentioned that might be interested actually is as that could be
a nice opportunity to drive adjacent demand - a LOT of the time we spend
with clients is around how they define themselves, and that reflects
internally just as much as it does externally.

All best,
Josh
