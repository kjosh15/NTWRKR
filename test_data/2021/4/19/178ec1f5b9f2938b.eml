Sure - I moved it to 2:30 GMT on the 26th, if that works.

I keep coming back to how quickly we could vet this project. I=E2=80=99d lo=
ve to
get some funding to do the initial pitching, and have total faith that you
could see it through.

Being able to outsource most of the work aside from the executive wrangling
aid also exciting - its a fairly painless way to accelerate a huge new
health tech market, and to secure a position in potentially doing the same
in others.

Let me know what you think and if I can answer any questions in the
meantime, and best of luck with the cottage!
