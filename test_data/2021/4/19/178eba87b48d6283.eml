Dear Friends and Family,



We hope all finds you well in these truly exceptional times.  Spring is in
full swing here in Dublin.  We have been lucky enough to have some amazing
weather and the time to enjoy it.  Vaccines are being rolled out here, a
bit slower than in the US but steadily gaining speed and we feel confident
that we will get ours in time to travel home this fall for a visit.  We
have been moved up the list as Ireland is now doling out =E2=80=9Cthe jab=
=E2=80=9D by age
instead of the complicated 15 group scheme they had before.  I guess there
are some advantages to getting older.



An Otter on the Dodder



We have been enjoying walking in our 5km radius.  One of our favorite walks
is along the river Dodder which has a mostly continuous trail from the city
center to Bushy Park passing through several parks along the way.  On our
last walk down the Dodder we were fortunate to see a river otter, but too
slow to take a picture of it.  We did manage to get shots of a heron, the
elusive cormorant, an adolescent swan, an adorable fox and the Dodder
Rhino, which was clandestinely installed sometime in 2012.  At Bushy park
we even saw some live music while waiting in line for ice cream.  It wasn=
=E2=80=99t
the greatest live music, just some guy playing The Girl from Impanema and
then Old McDonald on his guitar, but who are we to complain?



New Freedoms



As of last Monday, we can now travel anywhere in Dublin County and 20 km
into neighboring counties!  This means that we can now explore areas
outside of our 5km for the first time since December!  Some of the pubs
have also started serving pints to go so now we can enjoy an actual draft
pint of Guinness in the park.  It still isn=E2=80=99t the same as going to =
the pub
but its better than nothing and Guinness on tap here is so darn good!  We
have also explored further south down the coast.  We found a great trail
that goes from the Peoples Park in Dun Laoghaire to Dalky.  We can now walk
down Scotsman=E2=80=99s Bay Park to the Forty Foot swimming area where ther=
e are so
many people in just swimsuits diving into that cold, cold water.  We can
also now legally visit the city center again.  On Saturday we rode our
bikes there to get some cheese and enjoy a drink in St. Stephen=E2=80=99s G=
reen.
While we were enjoying our afternoon out, someone stole my bike!  Eric was
able to ride home but I had to take the bus.  I=E2=80=99m a bit bummed, I r=
eally
liked my bike, I bought it with my summer school money some years ago, but
I can get another one and as Eric says it is the quintessential
living-in-Dublin experience to have your bike stolen.



Glendalough



Friday is our favorite day of the week because Eric doesn=E2=80=99t have to=
 work on
Fridays and we are able to go places that are usually too crowded to visit
on the weekend.  Last Friday we drove to Glendalough for a hike, which we
can do because of the relaxation of the restrictions.  Glendalough is a
lake in County Wicklow that has a 12th century monastery and old mining
buildings from the 1800=E2=80=99s.  We walked around the lake which include=
d
passing a waterfall, climbing over 1000 feet, some spectacular views, a
mountain goat, loads of deer and some sheep and a difficult descent over
very rocky and uneven ground.   It is to date the longest and most
difficult hike we have done since Eric=E2=80=99s injury and he rocked it.  =
I will
admit the descent made me a little nervous for his ankle.  When we got
home, we negated all of the health benefits of the hike by splitting a
munch box for dinner.  A munch box also known as a snack box or spice bag
is an assortment of various fried food served with a curry dipping sauce.
They are a staple of Chinese take away here and ours included: fries better
known as chips, onion rings, chicken wings, chicken strips, chicken balls
and sausage.  What they lack in nutritional value, they make up for in
deliciousness.



In Other News



One exciting discovery for us is a farmer=E2=80=99s market that is about a =
mile and
a half from our apartment.  We have been going there weekly for fresh
produce, milk, bread, olives and other fun things.  My favorite stand sells
local apple juice and has one that is a blend of apple and black currant.
It goes great with gin.  We also, fingers crossed, think that we are close
to being finished with the house buying process.  The list of things that
need to be done is down to one.  Hopefully we will have a closing date this
week or next.



Stay safe and enjoy the spring!



Much love,



Eric and Marti
