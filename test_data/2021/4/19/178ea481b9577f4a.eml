I spent a little time over the weekend and came up with three immediate tar=

 Jaron Lanier, Chief Technology and Officer Prime Unifying Scientist at Mic=

ing a Future of Work show, and may even be willing to endorse it. They don&=
#39;t have anything in this space specifically, but do have a pretty big de=
partment focused on the topic. I also have Jordan Harbinger&#39;s agent who=
 is tied into them so we could submit through multiple angles at once. <br>=
<br>2. I can go to the following companies (all very large) if you can help=
 me qualify any of them:<br>	Blackrock<br>	HP<br>	Verizon<br>	Workday<br>	G=
oogle<br>	Mastercard<br>	Motorola<br>	IDEO<br>	Walmart<br>	Amazon<br><br>3.=
 Crunchbase has a list of ~1000 recently funded, Small-to-Medium sized busi=
nesses sortable by the size of their recent raise. We could use this to mak=
e a list to pull targets from to further qualify for outreach:<br><br><a hr=

W50. <br><br>Otherwise, it seems like we could start with a direct pitch fo=

t;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $3=
0-40k per episode for a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all=
 development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipme=
nt, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music. Everything i=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In ter=

hing like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =
Gilded and Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast =
strategy that best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full ed=
itorial approval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at ch=
eckpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles =
all production logistics, including: development (creative), research, writ=
ing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-producti=
on and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was =
getting at in our call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distr=
ibute the shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, th=
ough). We rely on a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for th=
at, and typically the clients put together a marketing plan as well. Howeve=
r, we can strategize together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcas=
ting is extraordinarily competitive, so it requires another budget for dist=
ribution and marketing. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal=
 podcast; if it&#39;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case=
, distribution is super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So,=
 long story short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service or=
iented company. Might be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with=
 instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington=
 Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Clevelan=
d Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=

;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad we spoke the other day - I=
 think I have a really good lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam =
Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief=
 at World 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &qu=
ot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buy=
out of the G100. They&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., C=
MO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<b=
r>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a po=
dcast interviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights t=
o share across all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it wa=
s exactly the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was =
much more practical than what he had considered (which was focused on inter=
viewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just =
on the other side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear o=
n what their approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time t=
o socialize this internally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. Th=
ere&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal res=
ources. (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I thin=
k it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I=
 pull together a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More =
critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow aft=
ernoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put=
 this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game,=
 I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a wor=
k process breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me =
know what you think!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - J<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;=
traffic cop&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group,=
 decide on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each =
group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an E=
P as well as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<=
