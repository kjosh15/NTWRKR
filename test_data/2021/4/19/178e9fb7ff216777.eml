Hi Josh

Thank you for following up!

I am happy to hear you say that - as it is also my understanding that a
drop auction would likely work best.

In terms of the contract scope and price, would it be possible instead to
agree to a set price/fee? Based on the terms by which we will be working
together, it is not customary for us to work with percentage royalty style
contracts.

I would very much like to have the opportunity to work with you on this
project and hope we can find a good way to move forward together.

Best wishes
Rosey

almost 20 years ago, but I forget if you ever met personally. Thanks for as=

 manager. Obviously, Kehinde has the vision for this and will connect the d=
ots for you as far as the idea, number of NFTs, form, etc... As you mention=
 in your email (pertinent text below), letting everyone know how selling th=
rough different formats works, and since you mention the Wild West any spec=
ific risks or restrictions associated with each format would help too.</div=

. You can find his resume at=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.josh.is/" target=

the forefront of various waves of technology for a few decades now,=C2=A0ju=
st look at his client list. I also can&#39;t resist adding his crow vending=
 machine Ted talk: <a href=3D"https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_a_thou=

iv>Kehinde, why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope of =
what you are thinking to get the conversation started. And if you don&#39;t=
 mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the background if that i=
s alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs ar=
e a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I can help=
 in any other way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0</div><d=
iv><br></div><div><i>Email: We do indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him=
 when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture framed of o=
urselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quot;epito=
me of NY experience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the background and ev=
erything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock sounds=
 amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve b=
een working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the =
Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we realize=
d we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#39; =
who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his securit=
y wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can =
certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via per=
sonal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild west A=
TM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!=
<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I can d=
o to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or so=
me other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love b=
ack at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></d=
