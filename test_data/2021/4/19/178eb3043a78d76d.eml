you as far as the idea, number of NFTs, form, etc... As you mention in your=
 email (pertinent text below), letting everyone know how selling through di=

 why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope of what you ar=
e thinking to get the conversation started. And if you don&#39;t mind, I wo=
uld love to stay on the email thread in the background if that is alright, =
to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs are a space I=
 have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I can help in any oth=
er way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0</div><div><br></di=
v><div><i>Email: We do indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him when we fi=
rst moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture framed of ourselves of=
 a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quot;epitome of NY ex=
perience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the background and everything. ;=
) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.<b=
r><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#39;ve been working=
 with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss =
twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were o=
n the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs&#39; who had his=
 credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!<br=
><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can certainly h=
elp, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand=
, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild west ATM so he&#3=
9;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!<br><br>Fee=
l free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I can do to help. =
Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or some other pl=
ace in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love back at you,=
