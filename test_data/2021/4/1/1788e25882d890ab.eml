Andrew, meet Lachlan, the newest addition to the Indigometrics team.
Lachlan is going to be helping firstly around the items we'd previously
discussed of documentation, testing, and deployment.

Lachlan, Andrew's the brilliant mind behind almost all of our code to date
and your absolute best source for understanding our architecture, code,
design, etc.

Can you two connect and get Lachlan up to speed on the above topics so he
can start building up our documentation? I've asked for an overview of our
existing architecture as a first priority before we start getting into
testing.

Thank you, gentlemen!!
Josh
