Excellent feedback - in terms of sales mostly stuff we already knew, but in
terms of selling it into enterprise was able to break it down into:

1. Can we scale cheaply?
2. Do we have a roadmap of interesting features / growth they find
appealing?
3. How do we validate? (Wharton, their HBR article, etc. all part of this).

Let's talk about the roadmap on our next call - this is a chance to wax
poetic and draw interest.
