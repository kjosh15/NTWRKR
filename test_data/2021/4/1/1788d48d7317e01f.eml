Otherwise, it seems like we could start with a direct pitch for a Future of=
 Work podcast pitch to Microsoft via Jaron and Jordan, and then try to form=
alize a qualification process for the second and third options while it pro=
gresses so we&#39;re ready to send a more bulk email when the show hits. Or=

TS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per =
episode for a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all developme=
nt (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shippi=

;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a wo=
rk process, it varies. However, I think what you can say is something like:=
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and=
 Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast strategy t=
hat best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial ap=
proval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints =
along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all produc=
tion logistics, including: development (creative), research, writing, fact-=
checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and exc=
lusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at=
 in our call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distribute the =
shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, though). We =
rely on a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and ty=
pically the clients put together a marketing plan as well. However, we can =
strategize together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is ex=
traordinarily competitive, so it requires another budget for distribution a=
nd marketing. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcast; =
if it&#39;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case, distribu=
tion is super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long stor=
y short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented com=
pany. Might be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: =
New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spo=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad we spoke the other day - I think I =
have a really good lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky=
, the former editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World=
 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-M=
cKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of th=
e G100. They&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO=
50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast int=
erviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights to share a=
cross all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exactly=
 the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was much more=
 practical than what he had considered (which was focused on interviewing o=
utside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the ot=
her side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what th=
eir approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to sociali=
ze this internally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s=
 also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources. (=
Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;=
s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull tog=
ether a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More criticall=
y, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - =
I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this ide=
a to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need s=
ome rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work process=
 breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=

t;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic c=
op&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group, decide o=
n topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each group to =
do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well=
