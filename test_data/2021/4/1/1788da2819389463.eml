I am really happy to hear you and Hulda are still together. Love
that woman. How old are the kids, and how are you enjoying being a father?
I have to admit, picturing you as a father kind of cracks me up, but in the
best way.

I understand going to Iceland during the pandemic. Do you think you will
stay in Iceland long term? And don't be surprised if I come to visit,
Iceland has been one of those places I have been meaning to go for a long
time. My saving grace during the pandemic is having a house with a nice
little plot of land in the city, you kind of feel like you are in the
country, and having space and neighbors that weren't on top of you was
perfect. I kept thinking that doing the pandemic in NYC would have been a
nightmare.

I know you always have a lot of irons in the fire, so what spaces are you
working in right now? Any fun projects?

Really happy we are back in contact Josh, I have missed having you in my
life.

am a member on the board, and he is now planning fundraising strategies to =
make
the organization more self-sustaining. One thing he is considering is makin=
g a
series of NFTs with funds to directly go to Black Rock. He isn=E2=80=99t ve=
ry tech savvy
so I have been putting out some feelers to find a digital artist that could
help him navigate those waters and possibly translate his work into somethi=
ng
interesting. I should also say, this would be more to have a conversation a=
bout
ideas, possibilities, and how to do things. Since Kehinde did the official =
Obama
portrait he has enough visibility it may be a smart way to capitalize on th=
e
trend and build the non-profit endowment, he is literally spending millions=
 on
residencies for young artists. </p>

Do you have any suggestions of people he may want to contact?
Or know anybody I should ask? If you have ideas please let me know, if you =
don=E2=80=99t
no worries. Most importantly though I would love to hear how you are doing.=
