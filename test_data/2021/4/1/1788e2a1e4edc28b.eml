Thanks again everyone for a great start to what is hopefully a long and
profitable future! I wanted to get some time scheduled on a few meetings:

1. When is a good time for a second one-on-one meeting to discuss OKRs (
https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and when can we set a
calendar date to revisit these quarterly (I.e., Josh <> Lachlan, Chris
<>Loreley)?

2. When is best to schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else
over the next few weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's going?
This is just a support call to make sure you're getting what you need to
feel successful. (I.e., Josh <> Lachlan, Chris <>Loreley, Lachlan <>
Loreley)?

3. When works best for standing weekly meetings? Chris and I have had some
success with Monday/Thursday, but feel free to weigh in.

Feel free to reach out directly/individually to get these set (other than
item #3)!

All best,
Josh
