Wanted to get your feedback on what our official toolset should look like.
Chris runs PC, I run macs, he loves Excel + Dropbox, I prefer GSuite...
right now it's a mess. And we don't have anything for collaboration /
project tracking. Do you have a preference or suggestions for what tools we
use as an organization?

P.S. This is work stuff and we're not paying you yet, so I froze this
question until your official start date. Please ignore if we've covered it
in the meantime!
