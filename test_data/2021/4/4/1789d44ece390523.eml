This isn't intended as a critique - I'm just checking in - but am I right
that we only have transcripts for three of the six EPs so far? I wanted to
make my marketing material for all EPs; do we have any content elsewhere
that might give me some good quotes to tie into for each?

Also, this begs the question of if we're still on schedule for an April 15
launch, and/or what's up with the additional 4 EPs? (We still haven't heard
anything about them yet!)

All best,
Josh
