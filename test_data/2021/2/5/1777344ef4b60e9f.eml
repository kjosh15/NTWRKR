No dice except for impactinternational.com, who in 2018 said: "Sorry this
isn=E2=80=99t a good fit for Impact as we=E2=80=99re a fully custom leaders=
hip development

solutions and program content are created uniquely for each client we work
with."

:/ That said, we can get 3rd degree connections to any of these, and if
nothing else have a decent shot of engaging them in conversation I would
think. Can you prioritize the list based on your experience with Lane 4 and
I'll roll them into my outreach pipeline?
