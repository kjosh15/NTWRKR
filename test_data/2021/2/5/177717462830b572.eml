Another win; spoke yesterday with a VC who wants to introduce us to
Andreeson Horowitz and has some really strong opinions on VC funding in the
CA ecosystem (he's been a part of the biggest investor clubs in CA - he's
former Google). He's going to run me through a practice pitch and provide
other introductions (this may be his way of kicking the tires before
investing himself.)

Onward,
Josh
