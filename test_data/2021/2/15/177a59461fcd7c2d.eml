Benni,

I have a tv sizzle reel I need to host and am looking for recommendations
on someone who can shoot it. It's a standard "guy seated in a dark room
with a fuzzy background" talking head piece, but I don't have the camera,
etc. Do you know anyone in Akureyri who would be interested in doing a bit
of side work?

Hope you're well and enjoying France!!
- J
