Wanted to write with:

1. Thanks for the call - SUPER fun as always; I'm glad I was able to help
provide an impromptu geography lesson! Let me know if you want some crazy
waterfall pics or evidence of the sun being up at midnight, etc.

2. I've included a deck on Monerium and one on Videntifier; happy to
provide connections to either, and would be grateful to any
introductions you think would benefit (if not yourself, first!)

3. You mentioned soon being able to contract outside experts. I'm looking
to sign up a couple retainer contracts this year as Indigometrics grows.
I.e., one-off projects are schedule killers, and I've found I really like
the cumulative impact of ongoing retainers. Is this sort of thing a
potential here?

All best wishes,
Josh

P.S. I'm watching the ravens do tricks over the snowfield in front of our
house; Icelandic ravens are HUGE (nearly as tall as my 4-year-old) so it
gets really mind-melting when they're tiny and floating in the sky before
they land next to a sled and suddenly seem to dwarf it... Thought I'd
mention it in the spirit of trans-continental interest!
