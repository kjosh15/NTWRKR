Wise man.   There is a certain emotional cachet to getting funding, as if
someone else thinks your product is worth backing.  But it brings a ton of
headaches with it, along with dilution.   And  if you believe that your
product is ultimately valuable you don't need the investor validation. they
will always still be there later once you've proved that.

In Joey and Martin's case I persuaded them that one good (I.e.family
friendly) initial investor was all they needed after they ran out of
their own funds.  That was ME, and it got them through a year or so when
they could be free to build things out without anyone breathing down their
necks.  And while I got a good deal it came with tons of risk, which I took
because I knew Joey and what he was capable of.

Keep me posted.  I will give you feedback on the new deck in a few days.

Best, R
