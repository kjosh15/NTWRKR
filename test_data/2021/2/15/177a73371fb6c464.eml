Hey, Josh

I hope you're doing well.

Ironically, I've been super busy working as President of IATSE Local 15
while our industry is shut down. I've not been keeping up with personal
email very well.

Did I ever get you connected to my cousin, Pilar Gerasimo? Her book, Health
Deviant came out right before the pandemic hit in early 2020. Here's her
website for the book: https://www.thehealthydeviant.com/

We are doing a lot of lobbying and supporting our unemployed workers. We
are also looking ahead at workforce development as we have people retiring
or leaving the industry due to the current lack of work. Negotiating with
employers over workplace safety and return to work protocols are also
keeping us busy. Thankfully, I have a wonderful new Business Rep who joined
us last May after representing nurses. She brought lots of experience in
negotiating for infection mitigation.

It would be good to hear how things are going for you all.

Sincerely,
Jennifer Bacon
