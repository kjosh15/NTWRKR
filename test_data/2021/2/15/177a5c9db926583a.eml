Laura,

Thanks again for the call the other day. As I work through my notes I
wanted to follow up to ask for a little more detail on who your ideal
client for coachability testing might be. I ask as I have pretty good
access to some big corporate senior leaders, and speak regularly with many
of them. I know you mentioned scale, interest, and accessibility as being
key, but can you expand a little on what else might distinguish a good from
bad option? If I can get a little more resolution I'd like to draw up a
short list and see how close we can get to a dream team cohort.

Much obliged!
- J
