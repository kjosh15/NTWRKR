Got some really good feedback from my conversation with Domenic Merenda:

1. He's on the advisory board for Google Ventures. His words "don't touch
them. They'll take a huge amount of equity and make it impossible to get
future rounds so you wither and they can acqua-hire your talent." He had
several other comments, but the gist of it was that if you're not
AI-focused steer well clear.

2. Salesforce. He knows a bunch of folks in their investment arm and is
happy to make an intro to either, but warns that they will only look at
companies that have $1mm ARR, solid. That said, if you do they're
apparently one of the best corporate arms for helping their investments
with introductions, deal flow, advisors, etc.

3. Pitching. He's going to walk me through a full-on "interested VC" (2nd
meeting style) pitch to beat any remaining rough edges off.

It turns out that he's looking for cool people to do projects with going
forward and thought my network would be great for validating a couple of
his hypotheses - so that's a no on investing himself (at least at our
size).

Tomorrow I'm talking to Mark Silva of KITEsrm.com; expecting some useful
feedback and potentially some good introductions there.

Onward,
Josh
