Of course. Let=E2=80=99s get it out today.=20

I spent Monday and Tuesday putting two pages together=E2=80=94one =
synthesizing what we discussed regarding the online chats and the other =
just a simple storyboard with a bit of visuals mixed in.

Let me put it all together this morning with the previous C-Side pages, =
and we=E2=80=99ll get it over to Jaron.

Thanks for the text document. That was really helpful to have it laid =
out so thoughtfully.

Matt

said, I think I have a general idea of what I'd like to see in an =
agreement:<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">Your production company and my =
LLC work in partnership to develop and pitch the C-Side show idea. If =
we're able to secure funding, we'll split development efforts to =
serialize the show, with a subset of total profits set aside for 3rd =
party participants (including EPs). If at any point either party wants =
to leave the project we should have ownership %'s worked out.<br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">In terms of the work, I'm happy to leave final =
creative decisions in your hands (as this is your biggest prerequisite!) =
but would like to see strong financial assurances in exchange and would =
like to split business and financial decisions going forward.<br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">Other questions are around:<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">Term; how long to shop the project?<br =
class=3D"">Obligations/ownership beyond the term?<br class=3D"">Titles?<br=
 class=3D"">Copyrights? <br class=3D"">Development expenses and =
insurances?<br class=3D"">Assignments to other parties?<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">and, of course %'s of ownership (and splits for EPs, etc.)<br =
