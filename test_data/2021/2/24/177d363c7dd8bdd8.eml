NP; I expect these things to take time. The U.S. is trying not to fall over
at the moment and the postal system isn't leading the charge in recovery...

Not clear. The UK has a flat 10% capital gains for assets, which would be
better than the US, in which case I suspect the US would want to get its
cut anyway. TBH, I suspect that if we approach a sales event it will be a
matter of finding the best tax attorney we can and then just doing our
best. The rule of thumb seems to be that until you have >$500k/year in
earnings it isn't worth messing with outside tax vehicles like offshore
accounts, etc.

Will do and have done - he had a great time!! Sorry we didn't get to call
you yesterday but everything stacked up and suddenly Haakon was yawning in
my arms and chanting "Dr. Seuss, Dr. Seuss, Dr. Seuss!" as a call to
bedtime reading and sleep. We'll try to catch up this week.
