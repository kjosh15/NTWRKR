AWESOME!!! Huge congratulations, Mike. Well deserved and well earned;
really excited to see what you do with this!! As ever, if I can be of any
help please let me know.

Otherwise, if you can connect me with Elyse I'll set up a time for us all
to chat. Excited to hear about what she's targeting and how/if I can be
useful.

All best wishes,
Josh
