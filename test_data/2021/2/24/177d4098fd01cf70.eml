Mark,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about First Round - the more I
dig into their existing investments the more I think they may be a good
fit.

Again, Indigometrics is a B2B SaaS platform for Human Capital Management
using peer-to-peer surveys to model human behavior over time. We've
developed a suite of dashboards and data tools to allow employees to target
behaviors to improve their career outcomes, and leaders to manage their
corporate culture where, when, and how it matters most.

We call it the Google Analytics of Corporate Culture.

I've attached an overview deck, and would love to talk to whoever you think
is best over there!

Much obliged,
Josh Klein
