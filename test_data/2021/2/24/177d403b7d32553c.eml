Chris,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about MLT and John Rice. We built
Indigometrics.com to provide solid data on employee behavior based on core
corporate beliefs. Our mission has been to arm employees with the
information they need to improve their outcomes in relationship to the
company, and to inform the organization about how, who, and what is needed
to support this.

Since BLM and the murder of George Floyd we've discovered an enormous
appetite from clients for using this system to measure DE&I behaviors over
time. I'd love to connect with John to see if there is overlap and to
compare notes!

I've attached a brief overview deck, but would like to walk him through our
sandbox if he's interested.

Very much obliged,
Josh
