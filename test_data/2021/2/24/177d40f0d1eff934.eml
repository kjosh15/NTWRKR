Mark,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about Comcast. They clearly
understand B2B, and some of their recent investments, like FortressIQ, show
they get the value of data-led insights to the enterprise.

Again, Indigometrics is a B2B SaaS platform for Human Capital Management
using peer-to-peer surveys to model human behavior over time. We've
developed a suite of dashboards and data tools to allow employees to target
behaviors to improve their career outcomes, and leaders to manage their
corporate culture to reduce churn, increase employee alignment, and
increase L&D and internals culture efforts effectiveness.

We call it the Google Analytics of Corporate Culture.

I've attached an overview deck, and would love to talk to whoever you think
is best over there!

Much obliged,
Josh Klein
