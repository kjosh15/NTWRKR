Matthew,

It's been a while since we spoke at SXSW - really, it seems like a
lifetime!! My kids have moved on from Paw Patrol and it seems that so have
you; I'd love to connect some time to compare notes if you think that'd be
useful! And did you ever buy some land for hiking trials??

Separately, I have a friend who has a similar background to yourself - in
digital media (Apple TV Channels, Hulu), and he worked on a startup for
kids video from two ex-Nickelodeon guys. The last two years he's been doing
more M&A work and wants to move back to operations, and would like to catch
up with you about the changes. Do you mind if I introduce you?

All best wishes,
Josh
