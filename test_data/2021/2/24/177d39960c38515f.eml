Your website is failing when I attempt to finalize an order (Trk. 
#1107140281). When I click "Ship" after entering in all required 
information I get:

"Shipment cannot be completed.
- (1000) Authentication Failed"

However, I cannot find any reason why. My login in josh@johs.is, account #: 
10783323. The shipment is to Devon Klein in Seattle. Can you help me get 
the shipping label please?

Many thanks,
Josh
