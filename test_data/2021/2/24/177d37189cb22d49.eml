I'd love to get your advice on being more active in interviewing on these
calls. I'm realizing I've done a ton of work with senior execs and am very
comfortable with them and the content, but want to sharpen my ability to
pull good quotes out of them for tape. Do you mind setting up a brief call?
If so, let me know what times work for you!!

All best,
Josh
