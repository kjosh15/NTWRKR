I have a friend (see below) who would like to talk to you about Amazon,
security, and what it's like to work for Amazon in Seattle - he created a
security suite at Akamai and is targeting Amazon as an employer. Do you
mind if I introduce you?

All best wishes,
Josh

Hey Josh,
Great to catch up last week and congrats on the progress with IndigoMetrics=
.
As we discussed, I've love to connect with Myles when you get a chance.

Quick background:
I'm a  technology and media executive with expertise in management,
finance, and strategy that has spanned video, internet infrastructure and
advertising.  My 16-year career has included positions at NBC Universal,
Hulu, ESPN, 24/7 Real Media and Akamai as Chief Strategist of Media and
Entertainment - including development of the security suite.

Given the space that Amazon occupies at a nexus of the tech, advertising,
commerce and media ecosystem I really enjoyed our conversation about the
opportunities with data ahead.
Let me know if you need any more information from me.
