Thanks for offering. To be honest, I=E2=80=99m just not sure what I can =
ask you to do. Heavy Illustrator/Photoshop and TV treatment writing =
experience is the only thing useful here. But that doc you wrote up was =
really helpful.

I=E2=80=99ve had a designer working with me the past year but I needed =
to stop shelling out. So I did this one solo. It=E2=80=99s pretty simple =
looking, so it was only two days-ish.

Any future time sinks, we=E2=80=99ll have to figure out something =
different. But at least we can get this out to Jaron. Before then, =
please have a read over this. I=E2=80=99m sure there are errors.
