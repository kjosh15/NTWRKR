"ardent, fanatics"<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">In terms of the chat, do =
we want to allow users to choose the topic, or give them a list of items =
before the chat, or force them to discuss whatever GPT-3 chooses?<br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">I think we should have a EULA up front =
allowing us to use the content of the conversation, vs. asking after 20 =
exchanges. (This provides more blanket legal protection and "breaks the =
illusion" less.)<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">ACT II: can we emphasize =
that this isn't reading a text screen? I.e., using actors reading the =
script, or animations, or something more visual. Maybe just make the =
text bar in this image smaller?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">ACT II: Can =
we use a picture of a Boston Dynamics robot here to emphasize how real =
world this is? Would love to actually have a robot walk autonomously =
into people's homes before having a conversation? OMG, so intrusive and =
awkward...! If nothing else this might be a better visual to impress =
upon the reader how weird this would be.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">ACT =
IV: Think we should provide some examples here. I.e., political analyst =
on cults, or vaccine specialist, or protest movement leaders. Again, is =
it worth getting GPT-3 involved here to push the weirdness up a =
notch?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">All best,<br class=3D"">Josh<br =
