Barn doors didn't get fixed yet. I tied them together for now. We had
another windstorm night before last, but not as bad as the first. I need to
call a steel building guy to get the tracks repaired, I guess.

Septic field was inspected and doesn't appear to be damaged. The tree's
root ball left a seven foot deep hole which filled with a bunch of water
following the path of least resistance- seeping into the hole laterally. It
IS fluid from the drainfield equipment but it is not present due to broken
pipes. Just a place for the water to go and settle. I'm going to get a
couple neighbors to help me pull the stump and tip it back into its hole.
Right now everything is frozen, though.

No movement on Crowbox stuff for me lately. been busy trying to find Dani a
new car and dealing with the generator install, etc. The generator saga is
all done, so that's nice.

So, yeah, nothing new to report. Just staying in touch, realized I got this
email from you but hadn't replied.

-Steve
