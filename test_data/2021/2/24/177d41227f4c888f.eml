Yes, exactly. I'd rather see a higher ROI to cover additional development
costs, but think this is a reasonable pitch - it's not a huge cost over
buying us direct (which makes it easier to include Bechtel if we want), has
a good growth path, and gets us the cash when we need it. If we play it
right the cost to support will go down significantly as we progress,
meaning better margin for the overall inflow.

Put another way, I don't think we could provide less than 2k users up front
and still expect to deliver good value on the effort, and raising that to
5k still fits within our existing tiers in case we want to change pricing
structures before they sign up additional users. :)

We'll see how it goes!
