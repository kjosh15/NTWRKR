Chris,

Below are the points I want to hit in pitching a "Consortium Team"
investment from Mahesh, the CTO at Motorola.

Specifically, do the #'s suggested below make sense to you?

*"Indigometrics will provide integration and analytics on up to 2,000
employees the first year, with a scale-up option for up to 5,000 employees
the second year. ($35/person total.)"*

At a buy-in of $250k that nets us ~$2.90/user/month over two years, so not
a huge gain over our current pricing, but it would give it to us up front.
Let me know if you think we need to revamp the #'of users suggested to
create a better margin.

#######

We're looking to create a consortium of just a few companies to work
together to "solve" for DE&I, using data to provide accountability and
insight.

- We've been talking with Bechtel, who are interested, and are planning to
approach BP, Sherwin Williams, and Estee Lauder to give a good
cross-industry view.

- We're also working with Wharton's People Analytics lab and expect their
leading DE&I professor to participate in the project, providing feedback on
best practices, experiment design, and data analytics.

- The idea is that each company invest $250k to cover development and
management costs.

Indigometrics will provide integration and analytics on up to 2,000
employees the first year, with a scale-up option for up to 5,000 employees
the second year. ($35/person total.)

Indigometrics will also develop dashboard, analytics, and features as
required to support the effort.

All the data will remain the property of the respective companies, with all
learnings shared equally between each.

- World 50's DE&I group (currently ~400 companies) is also interested, so
this is a chance to help shape a potentially very large accountability
platform.

Are you interested?
