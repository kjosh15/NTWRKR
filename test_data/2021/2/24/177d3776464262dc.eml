This is great stuff!! As an aside, my platform Indigometrics
<http://www.Indigometrics.com> was strongly shaped by Whiting Williams=E2=
=80=99
ideas. Our goal was explicitly to connect data with purpose to ensure that
employees got a "seat at the table" in the ongoing conversation around what
organizations' meaning is.

Looking forward to it,
Josh

Elise - we'll use this for the Table Read tomorrow, and Josh - you may read
through this version to become acquainted before Thursday's tracking
