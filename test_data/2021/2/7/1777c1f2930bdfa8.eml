Smart. Yes, I agree.

I mentioned the other day that I think we need a revamped version of the =
document I put together for BBC3.=20

I spent several days on that, and we should get our money worth on it, =
as we=E2=80=99re both slammed. There is a storyboard-like page in there =
already. My advice is that we expand on that and revamp the design and =
geo-focus.

It=E2=80=99s exciting! Looking forward to it.

Matt
