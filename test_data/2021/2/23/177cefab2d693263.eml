I need to get you connected to Elyse. She=E2=80=99s taking a lot of the day=
-to-day
for Innovating 50. I know you=E2=80=99ve seen her on calls but a 1:1 would =
good
(well... including Ashley and Me). Just so she knows you can be a go-to
resource.

I now have responsibility for all World 50 groups. Which is something like
40 different communities and a bunch of different personalities, ways of
operating and experience on the group leader side. Fun but daunting...
