Hi Josh,

I think that it would be best if we could jump on a quick call to make a
plan for moving forward. Here is my calendar
<https://calendly.com/bret-distributeconsulting/30-minute-meeting>.

As far as the government initiatives, we have done work off and on for the
past three years in different levels of involvement. At the present time we
are holding off on actively pursuing governments due to the longevity of
getting the engagement underway. If they were to come to us, that would be
a different situation and it definitely speeds things up.

Talk soon

rel and Bret,<br><br>First off thanks so much for the deep consideration of=
 the platform - I really appreciate the time you&#39;ve invested, especiall=
y when I know you have so much on your plate!<br><br>Some responses:<br><br=
># On our aim with distributed workforces:<br><br>- There aren&#39;t many c=
ompanies that DON&#39;T support distributed workforces that we want to work=
 with, because we generally see that as a sign of imminent failure in large=
 organizations.<br><br>- It&#39;s my view that the challenges of a distribu=
ted workforce are very close to the systemic challenges - such as exclusion=
, stagnation, and inflexible bureaucracy - which fundamentally threaten com=
panies&#39; success.<br><br>- The big specific issues we are looking to tac=
kle - beyond providing solid baseline metrics on individual corporate value=
s - are DE&amp;I, Innovation, and Distributed Workforce. This area is core =
to our offering going forward.<br><br><br># On client fatigue:<br><br>- You=
 bring up a great point that if a client were to go through a long analytic=
s process with us and identify distributed workforce as a challenge it coul=
d be a difficult upsell to then enroll them in an in-depth process with you=
.<br><br>- Our platform is designed to be used ongoing, for the lifetime of=
 the company, and to provide metrics about the fundamental values of the co=
mpany AND specific change initiatives, such as Distributed Workforce. <br><=
br>- As such, our enrollment process is separate from the topic of tackling=
 specific issues. As you noted, we measure impact. Once we establish a base=
line we can tell a client that there&#39;s a problem, but then also measure=
 if the efforts they are making to resolve the issue are working - and if s=
o, where, with whom, and when. <br><br>- From our side that makes it easy t=
o enroll your services when needed: we&#39;ve identified a problem, and can=
 then provide data on the impact of their work with you. But there&#39;s no=
 intimation that whatever solution the client selects to address the proble=
m is prefaced or precluded by the work we&#39;ve done.=C2=A0<br><br><br># O=
n Distributed Workforce values:<br><br>- You make an excellent point that t=
he values you&#39;d need to measure are different from a purely in-place or=
ganization. It&#39;s not a huge effort for us to add new values (and the be=
havior statements that measure them), but more critically we&#39;re able to=
 map them to existing behavior statements embedded in the existing corporat=
e value set.<br><br>- This &quot;subsetting&quot; mechanism allows our algo=
rithms to slowly migrate more desirable behavior statements into the core v=
alue set where/when/with whom it creates the highest impact. This changes t=
he goal behaviors slowly over time to better align with the desired outcome=
s.<br><br>- This means that once you&#39;ve defined isolation, burnout, lac=
k of innovation, etc. you can cross-correlate them for whatever the client&=
#39;s core values are and then measure them over time. <br><br><br>All of t=
he above isn&#39;t nearly as elegant or concise as the video you sent, but =
I hope it helps explain how we see strong alignment with what Indigometrics=
 wants to provide, that our system is flexible in producing the metrics you=
&#39;ve mentioned needing, and that engaging clients either before or after=
 the use of our system should be flexible and additive. <br><br>At least, t=
hat&#39;s my initial impression! Let me know if the above is helpful and if=
 a followup call would help.<div><br>All best wishes,<br>Josh<br></div></di=
