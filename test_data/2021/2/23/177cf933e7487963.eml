nsideration of the platform - I really appreciate the time you&#39;ve inves=
ted, especially when I know you have so much on your plate!<br><br>Some res=
ponses:<br><br># On our aim with distributed workforces:<br><br>- There are=
n&#39;t many companies that DON&#39;T support distributed workforces that w=
e want to work with, because we generally see that as a sign of imminent fa=
ilure in large organizations.<br><br>- It&#39;s my view that the challenges=
 of a distributed workforce are very close to the systemic challenges - suc=
h as exclusion, stagnation, and inflexible bureaucracy - which fundamentall=
y threaten companies&#39; success.<br><br>- The big specific issues we are =
looking to tackle - beyond providing solid baseline metrics on individual c=
orporate values - are DE&amp;I, Innovation, and Distributed Workforce. This=
 area is core to our offering going forward.<br><br><br># On client fatigue=
:<br><br>- You bring up a great point that if a client were to go through a=
 long analytics process with us and identify distributed workforce as a cha=
llenge it could be a difficult upsell to then enroll them in an in-depth pr=
ocess with you.<br><br>- Our platform is designed to be used ongoing, for t=
he lifetime of the company, and to provide metrics about the fundamental va=
lues of the company AND specific change initiatives, such as Distributed Wo=
rkforce. <br><br>- As such, our enrollment process is separate from the top=
ic of tackling specific issues. As you noted, we measure impact. Once we es=
tablish a baseline we can tell a client that there&#39;s a problem, but the=
n also measure if the efforts they are making to resolve the issue are work=
ing - and if so, where, with whom, and when. <br><br>- From our side that m=
akes it easy to enroll your services when needed: we&#39;ve identified a pr=
oblem, and can then provide data on the impact of their work with you. But =
there&#39;s no intimation that whatever solution the client selects to addr=
ess the problem is prefaced or precluded by the work we&#39;ve done.=C2=A0<=
br><br><br># On Distributed Workforce values:<br><br>- You make an excellen=
t point that the values you&#39;d need to measure are different from a pure=
ly in-place organization. It&#39;s not a huge effort for us to add new valu=
es (and the behavior statements that measure them), but more critically we&=
#39;re able to map them to existing behavior statements embedded in the exi=
sting corporate value set.<br><br>- This &quot;subsetting&quot; mechanism a=
llows our algorithms to slowly migrate more desirable behavior statements i=
nto the core value set where/when/with whom it creates the highest impact. =
This changes the goal behaviors slowly over time to better align with the d=
esired outcomes.<br><br>- This means that once you&#39;ve defined isolation=
, burnout, lack of innovation, etc. you can cross-correlate them for whatev=
er the client&#39;s core values are and then measure them over time. <br><b=
r><br>All of the above isn&#39;t nearly as elegant or concise as the video =
you sent, but I hope it helps explain how we see strong alignment with what=
 Indigometrics wants to provide, that our system is flexible in producing t=
he metrics you&#39;ve mentioned needing, and that engaging clients either b=
efore or after the use of our system should be flexible and additive. <br><=
br>At least, that&#39;s my initial impression! Let me know if the above is =
helpful and if a followup call would help.<div><br>All best wishes,<br>Josh=
