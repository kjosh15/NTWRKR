 thanks so much for the deep consideration of the platform - I really appre=
ciate the time you&#39;ve invested, especially when I know you have so much=
 on your plate!<br><br>Some responses:<br><br># On our aim with distributed=
 workforces:<br><br>- There aren&#39;t many companies that DON&#39;T suppor=
t distributed workforces that we want to work with, because we generally se=
e that as a sign of imminent failure in large organizations.<br><br>- It&#3=
9;s my view that the challenges of a distributed workforce are very close t=
o the systemic challenges - such as exclusion, stagnation, and inflexible b=
ureaucracy - which fundamentally threaten companies&#39; success.<br><br>- =
The big specific issues we are looking to tackle - beyond providing solid b=
aseline metrics on individual corporate values - are DE&amp;I, Innovation, =
and Distributed Workforce. This area is core to our offering going forward.=
<br><br><br># On client fatigue:<br><br>- You bring up a great point that i=
f a client were to go through a long analytics process with us and identify=
 distributed workforce as a challenge it could be a difficult upsell to the=
n enroll them in an in-depth process with you.<br><br>- Our platform is des=
igned to be used ongoing, for the lifetime of the company, and to provide m=
etrics about the fundamental values of the company AND specific change init=
iatives, such as Distributed Workforce. <br><br>- As such, our enrollment p=
rocess is separate from the topic of tackling specific issues. As you noted=
, we measure impact. Once we establish a baseline we can tell a client that=
 there&#39;s a problem, but then also measure if the efforts they are makin=
g to resolve the issue are working - and if so, where, with whom, and when.=
 <br><br>- From our side that makes it easy to enroll your services when ne=
eded: we&#39;ve identified a problem, and can then provide data on the impa=
ct of their work with you. But there&#39;s no intimation that whatever solu=
tion the client selects to address the problem is prefaced or precluded by =
the work we&#39;ve done.=C2=A0<br><br><br># On Distributed Workforce values=
:<br><br>- You make an excellent point that the values you&#39;d need to me=
asure are different from a purely in-place organization. It&#39;s not a hug=
e effort for us to add new values (and the behavior statements that measure=
 them), but more critically we&#39;re able to map them to existing behavior=
 statements embedded in the existing corporate value set.<br><br>- This &qu=
ot;subsetting&quot; mechanism allows our algorithms to slowly migrate more =
desirable behavior statements into the core value set where/when/with whom =
it creates the highest impact. This changes the goal behaviors slowly over =
time to better align with the desired outcomes.<br><br>- This means that on=
ce you&#39;ve defined isolation, burnout, lack of innovation, etc. you can =
cross-correlate them for whatever the client&#39;s core values are and then=
 measure them over time. <br><br><br>All of the above isn&#39;t nearly as e=
legant or concise as the video you sent, but I hope it helps explain how we=
 see strong alignment with what Indigometrics wants to provide, that our sy=
stem is flexible in producing the metrics you&#39;ve mentioned needing, and=
 that engaging clients either before or after the use of our system should =
be flexible and additive. <br><br>At least, that&#39;s my initial impressio=
n! Let me know if the above is helpful and if a followup call would help.<d=
