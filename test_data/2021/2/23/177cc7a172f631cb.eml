Joshua,

Our local Staples office supply store will send faxes. Let me find out tomor=
row what they charge.=20

Perhaps more important, I finished preparing our records for Frank Khalife t=
o do our taxes. I mentioned you had moved to Iceland had were part of a star=
tup that might sell for a significant amount and you were bothered enough ab=
out the US taxes that you were considering relinquishing your US citizenship=
 because you didn=E2=80=99t want to pay both US and Icelandic taxes on the c=
ompany sale. He was quick to tell me he knew the US was unique in this regar=
d and he didn=E2=80=99t know about Eritrea or the third country. HOWEVER, he=
 informed me that while it is a hassle of paperwork, you claim your Icelandi=
c taxes on the sale as a credit against your US taxes. And since (I believe)=
 the Icelandic taxes are more than the US taxes, you will owe the US gov=E2=80=
=99t nothing from the sale of Indio. Even if you relinquish your US citizens=
hip, the US government will follow you for 10 years. I gather Frank is famil=
iar with these matters as a former British citizen.=20

I would strongly suggest you clarify this matter before making  any major ch=
anges. If Frank is right - and from the way he spoke, he sounded quite sure o=
f his position on the matter - you are in a much better position than you th=
ought you were.=20

More after I find out about the faxing matter.=20

Love,
DAD
