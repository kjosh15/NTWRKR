Meaning is there anything we can do in parallel to get some storyboard
material in front of Jaron to keep the conversation going. Happy to pitch

Josh

P.S. How did the big push of the last couple weeks go? I've only heard of
it through you but I'm very keen to actually see this big News project
you've been working on!
