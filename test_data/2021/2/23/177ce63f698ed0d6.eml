Thanks, Mark. I spent some time looking at these materials and have a few
folks I'm going to share them with, if that's ok (mostly fellow consultants
who can upsell your platform/services).

In the meantime, is it possible to get an intro to First Round - the more I
dig into their existing investments the more I think we may be a good fit.

Much obliged and all best,
Josh

P.S. https://kite.docsend.com/view/tcnd3zuvj2m28hat didn't resolve!
