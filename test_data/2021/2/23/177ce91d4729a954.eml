=C3=9Eetta reddast indeed! As I'm continuing to grow my network I'll keep
looking for ways to source 300 Brains to prospective clients and we can
loop in then; similarly as things open up and I'm able to reconnect with
contacts across the Nordics.

In terms of selling my services, for the most part I've worked on a
consultancy basis, either short-term advisory to senior executives or
longer-term on special projects, usually around technology and innovation
strategy. Finally, over the last few years I've increasingly been asked to
help companies large and small with their business development
internationally. Happy to set a call Thursday or Friday morning if you'd
like to discuss!

Looking forward to it,
Josh
