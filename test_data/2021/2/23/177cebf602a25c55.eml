Chris,

Wanted to follow up on two potential introductions, if possible.

John Rice <https://mlt.org/john-rice/> and the MLT looks AMAZING,
especially if they're interested in making their certification part of an
ongoing, continuous process of assessment and improvement. LOTS of
concurrencies here, depending on their model - plus the more highly ethical
people I can talk to about this platform the better! Let me know if a brief
intro paragraph would be helpful.

At present I'm going to ask to put an intro to Village Global
<https://www.villageglobal.vc/> on hold. They seem very well positioned as
investors and I didn't see any competitive investments with plenty of
adjacency, but I'm going to take a run at building a collective of
companies to fund a D&I effort (as a service investment) first. If we can
do that we may be able to pivot towards using services to hit our immediate
growth funding.

Very, very much obliged - both for the intro and the advice!

Looking forward,
Josh
