Iceland's double taxation treaty surrenders the rights to capital gains to
the US for the first five years of residency, and Wyoming has 0% capital
gains tax, so if I can domesticate there and sell soon I'd only owe the US
federal capital gains, or:

Long-term capital gains tax rateYour income
*0%* $0 to $53,600
*15%* $53,601 to $469,050
20% $469,051 or more

I.e., in Iceland capital gains is 20%, in the US it's (likely) 15%. The
real reason to consider leaving US Citizenship is that it and North Korea
(and Eretria) are the only countries to charge you over and above whatever
taxes you pay to the country where you live. It's going to cost me an
additional $1k/year just to file the paperwork, and if I make much more
than $108k I'll have to pay a substantial sum to the US ABOVE my Icelandic
taxes.

Put another way, I can come visit for up to six months any time - the US is
happy to have foreigners come spend their money - if I leave my
citizenship, but if I keep it I can never stay for more than six months
without them taxing the WHOLE year.

</rant>

Thanks for suggesting Staples; I ended up using www.gotfreefax.com which
seemed to send just fine. With a little luck you'll be receiving a couple
certified documents from NY soon!!

Many thanks and much love,
Josh
