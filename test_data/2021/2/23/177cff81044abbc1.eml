Cool.
For Myles - what his experience has been to work at Amazon, specifically in
Seattle
For Matthew - he and I have similar backgrounds (and overlapped at NBCU)
and up until two years ago I was working in digital media in operations as
he was/is. The last two years I've been doing more M&A work and want to
move back to operations - I've kept up on the space but wanted to catch up
with him about the changes.
