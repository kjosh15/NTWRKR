Hi again,
is it ok i send a customer of mine that i think might be interested in your
service your website or you prefer not for now? Its the customer i told
you that is doing restructuring of their internal systems and activities
and making plan for the coming years. Im sending him offer for other things
today and was thinking about mentioning this

If so, i could say something like "im working with a guy that is an expert
in technology and innovation strategy and has worked for....(who in that
case? ) :)

Thank you
