Thanks, both! Was excellent as always connecting again, Heather, and a real
pleasure to meet you, Joerg! I hope we can all meet RL someday.

In the meantime, do let me know how/if I can be of any help in your
respective projects, and Heather I'll ping you via iMessage about that
Clubhouse invite. I'm already looking forward to hearing what sort of
questions you get in your online events...

All best,
Josh
