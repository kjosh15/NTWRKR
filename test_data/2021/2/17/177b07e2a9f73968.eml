I last spoke to Miles Lennon in 2009
Myles Conley is a good friend, so NP here.
Matthew Evans is a gem, super nice and asked for my help in deciding to
leave Nickelodian.

Of the others, two I don't have any record of (no email thread to
reference) and one fired me from my work in IMAX' incubator. Whoop!

Send me intros and I'll take it away!
