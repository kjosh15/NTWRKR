Mark,

Thanks again for a great call yesterday - I learned a ton! I wanted to
follow up on a couple points:

- Can you send your deck for KITE? Firstly so I can get a better handle on
how to use your services myself, but secondly to introduce you to W50 as a
potential service partner for their customers.

- If possible, I'd love an intro to the right person at Comcast to talk
about participating in a D&I joint effort. (You mentioned you know Daniel
who runs Lift Labs there.) I think the idea of bringing in 4-5 corporate
partners to attack the problem as a group (for a fee) makes excellent sense=
.

Really appreciate the advice and assistance. As a total aside, your view on
having a portfolio of assets and active projects (as well as a mix of
services + platform) really  resonated. Very few folks I've spoken to have
as mature or nuanced a view, and I very much appreciated it.

All best,
Josh
