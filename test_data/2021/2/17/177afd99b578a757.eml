Sounds like a plan, and thanks so so much for the powerline adaptors!! Can
we reimburse you for the shipping? I'll give the router you're sending a
shot, otherwise we have a crappy Huawei here that I think I can beat into
submission.

Othinn is stoked about coding - excited to see what we do next! And yes, do
send an invite for weekend after next so we can get it on the calendar!

Gratefully,
Josh
