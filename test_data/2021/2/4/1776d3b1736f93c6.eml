Thanks, Devon! In terms of what was spent on Legos for XMas whatever you
suggested was spent - shit is expensive over here! Once you update us with
a total of what we owe you we'll look into setting up a monthly payment
schedule.

In terms of timing, the boys get home around 3:45pm, we usually eat around
5:30/6, and start the bedtime routine around 7:30/8pm. The guest room is
downstairs, so as long as you're not keeping Othinn up (his bedroom is
right next to it) I don't see any problems.

I think I'd rather avoid sharing our photos, sorry.

Can you send us your dates again?

Love,
Josh

As for the cat food amounts, let&#39;s update those. The last reported tota=
