Q1 it is a coming of age retreat for the majority of young people - meaning
the new normal is a state of illness. We wouldn't treat the most extreme

Q2/3 I'm struggling with the business model. Need to iron it out before
pitching for funding.
This deck is just to attract the right questions and people. Share away...
