Gustavo,

I got this message yesterday - you might want to call
l them to see if there is an issue and confirm your cell number for the
account:

Smoke weed calling to remind you of an appointment scheduled for tomorrow.
Please. Remember that during the scheduled appointment. We will need access
to both the gas meter and your gas appliances off of $38.60. Plus tax will
be charged. If you do not provide the company with the required access. If
you are unable to keep the appointment or provide us with the required wage
access, please call 718-643-4050 as soon as possible to cancel or
reschedule, please remember that we will attempt to call you two times
prior to arrival. If you do not pick up the call, then your appointment
will be canceled and you will have to call us to reschedule. Thank you and
have a good day. National Grid gas business is registered in New York as
Brooklyn Union Gas Company.

All best,
Josh
