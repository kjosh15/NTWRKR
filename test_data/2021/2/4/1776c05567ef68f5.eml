of science hurts its ability to create and disseminate knowledge. He has al=

Ida B. Wells into formal philosophy, and has addressed issues of race and d=

 Irish ancestry). =20
In the very long unedited interview that follows, we discuss many Big and I=

ullshit, the future of democracy, whether the U.S. is an oligarchy, culture=
 wars, human empowerment, and how philosophers should interact with the wor=
ld. Basically, the things I always wanted to ask a real philosopher about!
N.S.: OK, so, like, you're a philosopher. So, what's the meaning of life?
L.K.B.: To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
N.S.: Got it. I was always thinking it was something like "pet the fluffy b=
unnies and watch some anime." But that's not too far off, right?
Well, anyway. Your Twitter handle is @lastpositivist. What is a positivist,=
 and why are you the last?=C2=A0

The logical positivists were a group of early 20th century intellectuals, m=
ost famously gathered in Vienna in what we call "the Vienna Circle". They w=
ere scientists and philosophers interested in how to interpret breakthrough=
s in physics and mathematics that they had lived through, such as the disco=
very of Einstein's general relativity. What's more, they were living in pos=
t-world-war-one Vienna, formerly the head of a large empire but now the cap=
ital of a small rump state and in the midst of the socialist experiment we =
now call "Red Vienna". Many of the logical positivists thought that the soc=
ial changes the world was undergoing were intimately tied up with the scien=
tific and conceptual changes they studied.=C2=A0
Most philosophers take their project to have been an interesting failure, s=
et aside for good reason. But I think the way they combined scientific and =
social philosophy has much to recommend it, and the arguments against it fa=
r less convincing than generally supposed. Hence, I am the last to carry th=
e torch!
N.S.: So how do we need to combine scientific and social philosophy right n=
ow, in the world of 2021? What new things have we learned about the world i=
n recent decades -- or what new things have we learned about how to learn a=
bout the world -- that tell us about how we should organize our society?=C2=
=A0
L.K.B.: There's a lot to say here, but I will limit myself to just a couple=
 of examples! One is a relatively new example and the other (alas) perennia=
l.=C2=A0
Red Vienna was an experiment in socialist government, and that led to a lot=
 of interest in how one could use results from the social sciences to help =
workers rationally plan features of their own society and living arrangemen=
ts in a way that would be conducive to the common good. Members of the Vien=
na Circle were interested in this, and indeed their efforts bore some fruit=
 - readers may be interested in this [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwl=

While many of these very same questions are still relevant, I think nowaday=

 carbon capture technologies and think about how they can be integrated int=
o a comprehensive global strategy for dealing with this crisis. This sort o=
f techno-social coordination, towards the end of averting suffering and pro=
moting flourishing, is just the sort of project which the logical positivis=
ts can help us think about.
The more perennial issue the logical positivists can help us think about is=
 in avoiding being deceived by propaganda and obfuscatory jargon. The logic=
al positivists were famous for insisting on "verifiability". This amounted =
to an insistence that if a claim is to be counted as "cognitively meaningfu=
l", as in even a candidate for being considered true or false, then there m=
ust be some way of gathering evidence (inclusive of mathematical proof) tha=
t would help us tell if we should accept or reject it. So a claim like "the=
 bunny is on the sofa" would in suitable contexts be a meaningful claim abo=
ut the world, since we can look at the contextually appropriate sofa and se=
e whether or not the contextually appropriate bunny is there. But a claim l=
ike "the number 7 is furiously green" is not even wrong, it is neither true=
 nor false, since while it has the surface form of a meaningful sentence th=
ere is in fact nothing that it is like to gather evidence for or against it=

About verifiability and propaganda. In social science, I'm a big proponent =
of verifiability -- economists need to test their theories, and they didn't=
 always realize that they needed to test their theories, and now they are r=
ealizing it which is good. But when it comes to political propaganda, I won=
der if this is always a good criterion. It seems to me that most of the val=
ues and ideals that actually motivate large numbers of people to take polit=
ical action are unverifiable. It would be nice if we could get people to st=
orm the battlements of injustice or throw their backs into the building of =
a new nation by chanting "What do we want? Evidence based science! When do =
we want it? After peer review!". But I don't think we can. Instead, it seem=
s to me that most of what motivates people to action consists of what Harry=
 Frankfurt would call "bullshit" -- statements whose use-value is far more =
salient than their information-value. To use your China example, perhaps it=
's empirically meaningless to say that a nation has "DNA", but if the idea =
of America as a champion of freedom and dignity stirs us to help Taiwan pre=
serve its independence and India and Vietnam to resist Chinese territorial =

How might a logical positivist respond to the idea that bullshit is uniquel=

L.K.B.: Ah I guess it depends on big questions about how much you trust peo=
ple to reason straightforwardly about their own interests. I think for the =
logical positivists the Red Vienna context was quite important here. It's n=
ot like they just wanted to start throwing economic models at people and ex=
pect them to act appropriately. Rather, there was a whole nexus of social i=
nstitutions dedicated to public edification and opportunities for involveme=
nt in self-government that were themselves educational. Some of these (such=
 as a scheme for nightclasses for workers) many members of the Vienna Circl=

red. So I think it's very much an enlightenment goal they were working towa=
rds: a total package of cultural and institutional changes that would give =
people both the knowledge and ability to not only clear headedly reason abo=
ut their social situation, but collectively decide what is to be done about=
 and set in motion policies in light of those collective decisions. I think=
 that as part and parcel of building this society, a sort of no bullshit ap=
proach to political speech and persuasion is important, as expressive of - =
and contributing towards - the sort of trust in the public which we are try=
ing to vindicate.
N.S.: One thing I'm noticing here is that your view of philosophy is very r=
eal-world-oriented -- it's not about sitting around trying to devise intern=
ally consistent ethical rules for solving increasingly abstruse trolley pro=
blems [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkE1uxCAMhU8zLCP-MoEFi27mBN0jgp2=

what I imagined ethical philosophers doing when I was an undergrad. Instead=
, it's about making things better for real people and societies that actual=
ly exist. I like that.
So my next question is: What do you see as the most important social proble=
ms right now that philosophers should be attacking? I guess that could be U=
K society, or American society, or global society, or all of the above. Wha=
t are the biggest challenges we need to be tackling, or at least the ones t=
hat interest you the most? You mentioned climate change, which seems like a=
n obvious one. What are the others?
L.K.B.: Aye - in some sense that this-worldly focus is one of the main ways=
 in which I take myself to be inspired by the logical positivists. Referrin=
g to their own view, they famously ended their manifesto [https://email.mg2=

ine "the scientific world-conception serves life, and life receives it." Bu=
t fittingly enough I actually prefer a somewhat more down to earth statemen=
t of the same sentiment, made in a less famous passage by Otto Neurath: "Me=
n here on earth who flee sorrow and pain and wish to be kind to each other,=
 happiness, friendship, life as it is really lived on earth, these are our =
concern; speculation concerns us only so far as it helps to shape life and =
to make it happy.=E2=80=9D This is the attitude I try to bring with me to p=
hilosophy, and I hope it shapes what I do and say.
Of course, all this is somewhat belied by the fact that I am a useless and =
socially avoidant nerd. Do as I say not as I do!
As to what is most important for philosophers to do (besides pitching in as=
 part of the global effort to manage climate change), well I think it's a b=
it silly that we still haven't fully resolved what exactly truth is. We've =
certainly been given ample time! But I am guessing you mean to ask me about=
 more directly practical matters. Without really being able to claim this i=
s in any objective sense the most important issue that philosophers should =
be tackling, I am personally worried about the state of democratic institut=
ions and culture.=C2=A0
Even profoundly anti-democratic movements tend to declare themselves for ru=
le by the people. As mentioned, the Q conspiracy theories in the United Sta=
tes, for instance, seem to involve de facto persuading people that an elect=
ion that does not go their way cannot have been fairly carried out. It thus=
 gives people who are objectively acting to thwart the results of the elect=
oral process the assurance that they are really on the side of true democra=
cy. But such assurances evidently cannot always be trusted. After all, even=
 setting aside these conspiracies, there are countries in the world wherein=
 there is a sort of smoke-and-mirrors democracy - every now and again one m=
ay go through the motions of marking an X next to a candidate of your prefe=
rence, but the relationship between this social ritual and what actually ha=
ppens is opaque at best.=C2=A0
Thinking about how to identify instances of sham democracy, get out of that=
 state once one is it, and avoid getting there if it is still avoidable, se=
em to me very important things for social theorists to be engaged in. Doing=
 better will involve knowing about democratic theory, so as to think about =
the various institutional designs and voting mechanisms that might best gua=
rd against pseudo-democracy. And it will also involve being able to underst=
and and see through the propaganda and ideology that can serve to mask or c=
onceal non-democracy behind an illusion of formal democracy. Philosophers s=
hould hence be part of that conversation
But, in addition to these external sociological matters, there is something=
 like an underlying spiritual malaise that must be addressed. The worry is =
not just that we risk slipping into, or retranching, such pseudo-democratic=
 states. And my worry goes beyond the fact that people are deceived by aspe=
cts of their social environment that appear to empower them without actuall=
y rendering them able to affect the course of things. Worse, I think, is th=
at a great many don't care, or at least have passed a point of cynicism whe=
rein they do not really think things can be otherwise.=C2=A0
I am worried people do not recognise their disempowerment for what it is; h=
armful and contingent, capable of amelioration. Of all modes of government =
democracy is, on pain of self-contradiction, most dependent on the populati=
on actively buying in. This lack of investment in self rule, and lack of a =
nourishing democratic culture, must be understood, theorised, and ultimatel=
y combatted. We must work towards a renewed faith in the importance and pos=
sibility of genuine self-governance. This will be a task for ethics, cultur=
al theory, and, in some sense, existential phenomenology.
I think democracy is of intrinsic worth, as democratic institutions embody =
and constitute our collective self-determination. I also think democracy ha=
s instrumental value, as a means of protecting ourselves against domination=
 and abuse, and also securing peace abroad. These are very great goods, and=
 I do not want the possibility of realising them to slip away from us.
N.S.: I really like that. I've always thought that the word "democracy" sho=
uld be about much more than elections -- that it should be an ideology, and=
 that that ideology should be about institutions including and empowering a=
nd valuing their people. Economists and even political scientists both seem=
 to think of democracy in such narrow ways -- limiting it to the kind of th=
ing you can measure and put in a regression equation. Also, I think George =
W. Bush's misuse of the idea of democracy to try to justify the Iraq War tu=
rned a lot of people in my generation off to that word. But here we are, fa=
cing a resurgent if shambolic fascism in the West, and democracy seems like=
 just the ideology we need to counter it.=C2=A0
I think there's a real lesson here from World War 2. If you read the writin=
gs of people in the Roosevelt administration, like Henry Wallace [https://e=

f democracy as this very powerful ideology that could be the banner people =
rallied to in the fight against fascism -- an alternative banner to what th=
e Soviet communists were offering, as well. And I think we see that democra=
tic ideology embodied in much of the UN, and the Universal Declaration of H=
uman Rights, and lots of the good things the U.S. tried to do in the wake o=
f World War 2, including pushing the European powers to give up their colon=

What do you think? Is democracy an ideology that we should value, rather th=
an just a system of choosing leaders? Sorry if I'm rambling on a bit here, =
don't mean to hijack the interview.

wsletter! I presume this is what your subscribers are paying for.
I do indeed think that democracy is a broader ethos, and more comprehensive=

Du Bois wherein he argues that the arguments in favour of democracy natural=

e principle entails we ought support the socialisation of the means of prod=

t students at fancy universities tend to nod along and think it's all just =
obvious when one is saying democracy is good and women should therefore be =
able to vote, but then find themselves rather taken aback to find they have=
 just agreed to communism! What is to become of their internship at Goldman=
 Sachs?) So while I certainly think democracy is an ideological and social =
form of great worth and power, I don't think it is a natural opposite to co=
mmunism at all, perhaps indeed quite the opposite.

Which is not to say that the U.S. government isn't an oligarchy dancing to =
the tune called by the billionaire class, with middle-class American voters=
 getting their wishes only by happy accident. That may be the case! But the=
re does not seem to be solid evidence for or against that proposition at th=
is time.
That said, I like and am intrigued by your ideas for radical leveling of po=
wer. Tell me more about your research! As someone who has complained about =
both the incentive structure and the information aggregation mechanisms of =
economics for many years, I am greatly interested by this. What are one or =
two papers you've written that readers should know about!
L.K.B.: Well I don't feel qualified to adjudicate the overall state of the =
evidence in the back and forth on Gilens & Page, so I guess I will have to =
let that one drop. Though I will say that I don't find it that reassuring t=
o say that to get the advantage you only need to be making upwards of $140,=
000 per year! Nor would it be reassuring to know that the cause of this is =
the shared class interests of the wealthy and the government.
So let's step back from the empirics on correlating legislative outcomes wi=
th preferences. It still seems to me that, given knowledge of some of the u=
nderlying mechanisms by which much law is made, it would be remarkable if t=
his system were not oligarchic in its effect. This [https://email.mg2.subst=

tress once again that your readers should in fact read all of my papers - o=
r, if not that, then at least cite them.) As it stands, in many scientific =
fields, before a work is considered seriously available for public uptake i=
t must go through a review procedure, wherein scientific journal editors al=
ong with peer reviewers they select determine whether it is worthy of publi=
cation in their journal. In that paper we try to lay out the case that can =
be made for deciding what is to be shared in this manner, and compare it to=
 the case for a system wherein we make papers publicly available more or le=
ss as and when the authors see fit to publicise them. We conclude that on p=
resent evidence, we have no real reason to think the pre-publication peer r=
eview system is achieving much good for us, but lots of evidence to think i=
t is costly and time consuming. The style of argument here, the focus on th=

d this sort of interdisciplinary approach, in our case often drawing on and=
 working with social scientists in particular, was very much encouraged.
I think there were a few sources of hostility to that paper. I think for on=
e thing many scientists associate opposition to peer review with crankish b=
eliefs in one's own superior insight being quashed by a narrow minded Estab=
lishment. For another thing I think many scientists are concerned that with=
out journals the already inegalitarian distribution of attention and esteem=
 in science would become even more lopsided. After all, if I am not decidin=
g what to read based on journal publications, a natural alternative is to a=
llocate our attention based on who we already know and trust - and that wil=
l advantage the antecedently famous and the well connected. This could make=
 research far too conservative, and in any case academics tend to be very s=
ensitive to anything that might affect the distribution of credit and prest=
ige, so this is very salient to many in our community. (And in fact in some=
 follow up work we're trying to develop an answer to this worry - watch thi=
s space!) And, finally, I think for some people the peer review system is..=
=2E I don't know, quasi-sacred? It's jus=
t a key constituent of this thing, sc=
ience, that they value and identify with and hold to be of great importance=
=2E An attack on peer review is thus to=20=
some an extent an attack on their mos=
t cherished joys and struggles.
And as to the Enlightenment, in a remarkable coincidence it turns out that =
all and only the bits I disagree with are racist.
N.S.: Excellent answer. Happens to be mine too, what a coincidence! :-)
OK, one more topic, because we've gone on a very long time and could defini=
tely go on forever if we wanted. Do the "wokeness wars" matter? On one side=
 we have folks like Ibram Kendi and Robin DiAngelo saying we basically need=
 to reorient our society around the identification and correction of racism=
 in every detail of life. On the other side we have folks like James Lindsa=
y and the "intellectual dark web" (a name I still cringe at every time) tel=
ling us that this is all a plot by critical theorists to implement a sort o=
f pseudo-Marxism, etc. etc. On Twitter, you've followed and commented on th=
is debate a little bit, mostly to make fun of it. Should we care about this=
 debate at all, and if so, what should we think about it?=C2=A0

sHWN_Q] before on twitter that I think to a significant degree many culture=
 war issues are about resolving psycho-social tensions among the white (upp=
er-)middle class in the west. To a significant degree I think many of these=
 things are, well, their problem - there's no real reason for me or many ot=
hers to care. And conveniently enough for the status quo, at most these dis=
putes could only ever result in personnel changes. By which I mean, in so f=
ar as disputes around =E2=80=9Cwokeness=E2=80=9D becomes a central axis on =
which political life turns, then we are de facto leaving in place all the i=
nstitutions and economic structures we have now, but simply arguing about w=
ho is to staff them, and perhaps in addition whether we should have memoria=
ls to victims of the slave trade or speeches about the genius of Churchill =
given during moments of public solemnity. This is even deployed cynically b=
y defenders of the status quo, since they are always able to find someone w=
ho is from a demographically marginalised group to stick up for the establi=
shment, so they can then claim it is bigoted not to support their lackey's =
career when the left try and challenge their hold on power. Such is the cas=
e for "no", and on the whole I think this dominates my thinking on the matt=
er.
But life is more complicated than that. For one thing, psycho-social tensio=
ns are important to those who are in the midst of them and I would not wish=
 to diminish that. One hears of families unable to speak to each other, old=
 friendships torn apart, and so on, because of culture war disagreements. I=
n the course of an individual's life such things can be of the utmost impor=
tance, and it's inhumane to simply ignore that and give lectures on the pri=
ority of the material base over the ideological superstructure. For another=
 thing, the rest of us have to live with the white upper middle class, and =
they have disproportionate command over resources. Their foibles end up to =
a large degree structuring the incentives and cultural environments we face=
=2E Finally, some of what gets subsumed=20=
under "wokeness" really seems to me a=
 matter of basic physical safety and the social bases of self respect for s=
ome people, and this is a matter of rights that cannot be ignored. In the U=
K right now, for instance, there is a sustained assault upon trans people's=
 cultural standing and access to full participation in civic life. In so fa=
r as this issue and others like it are thought of as part of the culture wa=
r, then I think it would be positively immoral to simply dismiss their impo=
rtance.=20
So all in all I think it's hard to say! I just hope that people come to see=
 that corporate diversity trainings, which seem largely to turn white peopl=
e into insufferably anxious sycophants that I wouldn't want anything to do =
with, are not going to do much for black people. It's just etiquette traini=
ng which companies presumably hope will make it less likely they get taken =
to court on workplace discrimination. Let's focus more on how it is we deci=
de who it is that gets to be in rooms [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJw=

tion of our focus would be consistent with still being compassionate to peo=
ple's genuine difficulties, and standing up for the rights of marginalised =
groups to civic equality, as justice demands.
Thanks for the interview, Noah! Make sure you cite my papers, reader.

 for being considered true or false, then there must be some way of gatheri=

 should accept or reject it. So a claim like "the bunny is on the sofa" wou=

 look at the contextually appropriate sofa and see whether or not the conte=

is still avoidable, seem to me very important things for social theorists t=

 so as to think about the various institutional designs and voting mechanis=
ms that might best guard against pseudo-democracy. And it will also involve=
 being able to understand and see through the propaganda and ideology that =
can serve to mask or conceal non-democracy behind an illusion of formal dem=
ocracy. Philosophers should hence be part of that conversation</p><p style=

Remco Heesen</a> arguing against pre-publication peer review. (Though I str=
ess once again that your readers should in fact read all of my papers - or,=
 if not that, then at least cite them.) As it stands, in many scientific fi=
elds, before a work is considered seriously available for public uptake it =
must go through a review procedure, wherein scientific journal editors alon=
g with peer reviewers they select determine whether it is worthy of publica=
tion in their journal. In that paper we try to lay out the case that can be=
 made for deciding what is to be shared in this manner, and compare it to t=
he case for a system wherein we make papers publicly available more or less=
 as and when the authors see fit to publicise them. We conclude that on pre=
sent evidence, we have no real reason to think the pre-publication peer rev=
iew system is achieving much good for us, but lots of evidence to think it =
is costly and time consuming. The style of argument here, the focus on the =
scientific social structure, and the sheer amount of hate it got me online =
from scientists - all of these are a pretty good indication of the sort of =
person I am as a researcher.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px=

x; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">I think there were a few sources =
of hostility to that paper. I think for one thing many scientists associate=
 opposition to peer review with crankish beliefs in one's own superior insi=
ght being quashed by a narrow minded Establishment. For another thing I thi=
nk many scientists are concerned that without journals the already inegalit=
arian distribution of attention and esteem in science would become even mor=
e lopsided. After all, if I am not deciding what to read based on journal p=
ublications, a natural alternative is to allocate our attention based on wh=
o we already know and trust - and that will advantage the antecedently famo=
us and the well connected. This could make research far too conservative, a=
nd in any case academics tend to be very sensitive to anything that might a=
ffect the distribution of credit and prestige, so this is very salient to m=
any in our community. (And in fact in some follow up work we're trying to d=
evelop an answer to this worry - watch this space!) And, finally, I think f=
or some people the peer review system is... I don't know, quasi-sacred? It'=
s just a key constituent of this thing, science, that they value and identi=
fy with and hold to be of great importance. An attack on peer review is thu=
s to some an extent an attack on their most cherished joys and struggles.</=

> before on twitter that I think to a significant degree many culture war i=
ssues are about resolving psycho-social tensions among the white (upper-)mi=
ddle class in the west. To a significant degree I think many of these thing=
s are, well, their problem - there's no real reason for me or many others t=
o care. And conveniently enough for the status quo, at most these disputes =
could only ever result in personnel changes. By which I mean, in so far as =
disputes around &#8220;wokeness&#8221; becomes a central axis on which poli=
tical life turns, then we are de facto leaving in place all the institution=
s and economic structures we have now, but simply arguing about who is to s=
taff them, and perhaps in addition whether we should have memorials to vict=
ims of the slave trade or speeches about the genius of Churchill given duri=
ng moments of public solemnity. This is even deployed cynically by defender=
s of the status quo, since they are always able to find someone who is from=
 a demographically marginalised group to stick up for the establishment, so=
 they can then claim it is bigoted not to support their lackey's career whe=
n the left try and challenge their hold on power. Such is the case for "no"=
, and on the whole I think this dominates my thinking on the matter.</p><p =
style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1e=
m 0;">But life is more complicated than that. For one thing, psycho-social =
tensions are important to those who are in the midst of them and I would no=
t wish to diminish that. One hears of families unable to speak to each othe=
r, old friendships torn apart, and so on, because of culture war disagreeme=
nts. In the course of an individual's life such things can be of the utmost=
 importance, and it's inhumane to simply ignore that and give lectures on t=
he priority of the material base over the ideological superstructure. For a=
nother thing, the rest of us have to live with the white upper middle class=
, and they have disproportionate command over resources. Their foibles end =
up to a large degree structuring the incentives and cultural environments w=
e face. Finally, some of what gets subsumed under "wokeness" really seems t=
o me a matter of basic physical safety and the social bases of self respect=
 for some people, and this is a matter of rights that cannot be ignored. In=
 the UK right now, for instance, there is a sustained assault upon trans pe=
ople's cultural standing and access to full participation in civic life. In=
 so far as this issue and others like it are thought of as part of the cult=
ure war, then I think it would be positively immoral to simply dismiss thei=
r importance. </p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height:=
