Yes. Wholly yes.

Also, can you please please please tell me how you made such a beautiful
deck? Because damn!

Some very light questions, because you asked for feedback:

- is this a retreat for kids to go through rituals en route to adulthood,
or a rehab center for mental illness? My first read made these sound like
different things.

- is this for profit or nonprofit and if the latter what is the scaling
opportunity here? (I assume franchise but don=E2=80=99t see any details reg=
.)

- Are you looking for funding? There=E2=80=99s a build timeline and info re=
g. TAM
but no growth strategy/ask.

- Can I share this with our midwife who is recently enrolled in a program
to work in facilities like this? I trust her explicitly and she may have
valuable feedback.

Thank you for sharing this!! How else can I support?

- J
