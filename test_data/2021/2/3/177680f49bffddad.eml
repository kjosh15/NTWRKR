Thanks for the questions! I wrote some quick notes inline below to help
guide the conversation.



*# Your thoughts on the ways in which the key human capital risks corporate
leaders/directors should be aware of have changed since March 2020.*
The main ones are obvious - newly distributed workforces have fundamentally
changed the physical structure of employment, with secondary effects around
hiring, retention, compensation, and big open questions around future
growth, development, and collaboration. But potentially more interesting
are the impacts on and by consumers. The huge shift towards ESG as a
priority in purchasing decisions, for example.

That said, I think there is a similar fundamental principle in terms of how
organizations are orienting on these challenges, and that is purpose - or
more practically, corporate values. It is impossible for a mid- or
large-sized organization to respond quickly to these kinds of dynamic
market conditions without having employees aligned around core values in
order to swiftly reorganize and act.



*# How corporate use of technology has changed in the past 12 months and
how that technology might help or hinder how companies look at their
workforce.*
Again, there are a lot of obvious ones around new technology adoption, BYOD
(Bring Your Own Device), collaboration platforms, etc. But again there are
some very interesting evolutions we're seeing across verticals which I
think are going to become universal.

For example, we are starting to see more dynamic teams being formed because
companies have become more virtual. This is reducing the role of the
traditional line manager, which often increases effectiveness but also
blocks one (probably the biggest) of the main paths for cultural dialogue.

Similarly, tracking software is circling like a pack of hyenas =E2=80=93 co=
mpanies
seem tempted as they need something, even if they know that tracking
software is not the right approach. I can't tell you how often we hear "we
needed something to figure out what our employees were doing and what they
needed, but the solutions we found just increased churn and drove away top
talent."

This all aligns, again, to purpose or core corporate values. If those are
clear and employees are assisted in improving the associated soft skills in
ways that work for them as individuals, then the company becomes extremely
agile very quickly.

At the core of it all is data. There is just so much of it that companies
are going to use it - in fact, they'll have to if they want to stay
competitive. But the easy answer is to use the data in ways that control
employees, and in the current environment there is no better way to drive
away the talent you need.



*# How companies are currently using data and what that might look like in
the months/years ahead.*
There isn=E2=80=99t much good and actionable data out there =E2=80=93 engag=
ement software
has run its course (how many more ways can you ask =E2=80=9Cwhat would make=
 you
happy?=E2=80=9D) A lot of platforms are starting to produce data that is
interesting but not actionable - or worse, that's actionable in ways that
are ultimately harmful to the organization.

Changes to the use of data in human capital management are still evolving.
Post-COVID we expect most companies to try to match their old ways of
working and cultural messaging to a newly autonomous workforce, which is
going to be messy at best and terminal at worst, but all of which will
drive the adoption of new technology innovation.



*# More specifics on Indigo Metrics: what does it do? How does it change
workplace outcomes?*
At its core it=E2=80=99s a cultural messaging and measurement platform that=
 helps
individual employees chart a path towards growth on specific,
individualized soft skills. For management, it's a means for understanding
where and how the organization as a whole is evolving around specific
behaviors and how those are interacting with changing market conditions.

A useful analogy is Google Analytics. When Google Analytics was first
invented (as Urchin Software, bought by Google in 2005) there was no good
data around website user behavior. Fast forward just a few years later, and
data about what, where, and how visitors were interacting completely
rewrote customer engagement. It totally changed how companies interacted
with their customers by creating useful, specific, longitudinal data that
they could experiment with and learn from.

Indigometrics does that for Workplace Culture. It produces data around how
the company as a whole is acting, and enables a feedback loop for how those
behaviors are changing - and should change - over time. It does this with
specific, quantified data that allows companies to support employees in
flexibly evolving, at scale, with whatever means (comms, learning and
development, workshops, videos, etc.) is most effective for each employee.



*# Is this first generation data collection and analysis to inform employee
development because employees today expect more than a job, they expect
their employer to help them improve?*
Partly =E2=80=93 but it's also because the current parent to child relation=
ship
between firm and employee has raised unreasonable expectations from the
employee. That's particularly true in a world where we have multiple
careers in a lifetime.

We need to start by truly empowering the employee to help themselves to
improve =E2=80=93 supported by their employer. We are going to be operating=
 in an
environment where the bond between employer and employee will not be like
it was in the 1960s =E2=80=93 and we need cultural technology that reflects=
 that
reality in a way that benefits everyone.



*# How do you see a tool like this evolving? Are there other applications?*
The big expansion coming over the next few years will be multiple
behavioral frames, particularly in relation to D&I but also innovation.

Put another way, being able to support core values is fundamental. But
being able to build from there in response to changing market dimensions -
such as around Diversity and Inclusion, Distributed Work, Innovation, etc.
- is also critical.

What we have seen as we've deployed in large multinationals across
industries is that every organization is constantly evolving, and most need
specific support in managing that evolution well through specific
initiatives. The problem is that right now almost everyone is doing both of
those things almost completely blind.



*# Any thoughts on what the workplace of the future looks like vis a vis
what we have learned from our year of lock down? *
Autonomous employees will be the story of the future. Our technology is B2B
SaaS =E2=80=93 and will be for at least the next 5 years =E2=80=93 but over=
 time I expect
we will move into B2C SaaS as autonomous employees manage their own soft
skills. That will happen as they hop between different employers whose
purpose aligns with theirs (as demonstrated by data) and who can use and
help them develop their soft and hard skills as and where needed.

This will mean a big change in which employees will thrive. Today it's
around hard skills and managing your relationship with your direct
managers. Tomorrow it will be around getting the needed hard skills, and
from their managing your own journey through evolving your soft skills and
matching them with the employer that is best for you.

Employees that cannot self-manage in this way will not prosper. Employers
that cannot interact with talent that is managing its development in this
way will not prosper. But the companies that can do both are going to win
everything.

All best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

We are looking to address new considerations for board oversight of human
capital in light of the health and humanitarian crises of 2020.

We would especially appreciate your perspective on the role of technology
and how it is changing this element of board oversight. Specifically, we
hoped to at least cover the following points during our 45-minute
conversation:

Your thoughts on the ways in which the key human capital risks corporate
leaders/directors should be aware of have changed since March 2020.


How corporate use of technology has changed in the past 12 months and how
that technology might help or hinder how companies look at their workforce.

How companies are currently using data and what that might look like in the
months/years ahead.

More specifics on Indigo Metrics: what does it do? How does it change
workplace outcomes?

Explain The Google Analytics of Workplace Culture=E2=80=94what does Google =
have to
do with this?

Is this first generation data collection and analysis to inform employee
development because employees today expect more than a job, they expect
their employer to help them improve?

How do you see a tool like this evolving? Are there other applications?

Any thoughts on what the workplace of the future looks like vis a vis what
we have learned from our year of lock down?

elop their soft and hard skills as and where needed.<br><br>This will mean =
a big change in which employees will thrive. Today it&#39;s around hard ski=
lls and managing your relationship with your direct managers. Tomorrow it w=
ill be around getting the needed hard skills, and from their managing your =
own journey through evolving your soft skills and matching them with the em=
ployer that is best for you. <br><br>Employees that cannot self-manage in t=
his way will not prosper. Employers that cannot interact with talent that i=
s managing its development in this way will not prosper. But the companies =
that can do both are going to win everything.<br><br>All best,</div><div>Jo=
