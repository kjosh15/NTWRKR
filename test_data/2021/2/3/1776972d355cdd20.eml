Interesting food for thought vis a vis our potential growth paths. After my N=
ACD interview today I=E2=80=99m more convinced than ever that we are too ear=
ly - but much, much closer than before. Hopefully, that=E2=80=99s means we w=
ill land in exactly the right place w/regards to market fit. If we do, we wo=
uld benefit from having discussed our growth plans (again) in advance in ter=
ms of hires, size, exit, etc.
