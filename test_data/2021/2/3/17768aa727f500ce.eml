I'm submitting a case study on Bechtel's Diversity and Inclusion campaign
and how it is driven by quantitative data. We (Indigometrics) are working
directly with Bechtel's David Wilson (Chief Innovation Officer) and Kevin
Edwards (Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer) on this, and have plenty of
data to cite around how this data-driven approach is critical for making
true change within organizations at scale.

This is a critical insight as companies work to incorporate D&I campaigns
with distributed workforces while acquiring increasing amounts of data on
same. I.e., it's easy to get the data, and even easier to use it in ways
that damage rather than reinforce your D&I efforts.

This case study will demonstrate how companies can approach the use of
detailed analytics to improve D&I outcomes and drive positive corporate
culture change, providing specific examples they can use directly.

This work builds on the collaboration between Indigometrics and Bechtel
over the last year+ focused on this topic. Indigometrics has been solely
focused on corporate culture metrics for the last five years, building on
my last two books - Reputation Economics (McMillan) and Hacking Work
(Penguin) - as well as my consulting work to Fortune-500 executives from BP
to Ford to Merck.

We wanted to offer this to HBR before approaching any other outlets. Adi,
you've always been kind to me - even when I've pitched crazy off-the-wall
ideas to you out of nowhere - and I trust your judgement. Let me know if
this is worth pursuing!

Many thanks,
Josh Klein
