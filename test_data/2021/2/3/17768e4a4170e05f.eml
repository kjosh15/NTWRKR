Kris,

You're the absolute best person for this BUT you're also neck-deep in your
current company. Indigometrics is aiming at a Series A and I could use some
advice on how/who/what - do you know anyone that can help me think through
the financials on VC vs. Strategic (corporate) investor and size, terms,
etc. to shoot for?

Glad to hear you're killing it (so says Ron, anyway) and wishing you all
the best!

yours,
Josh
