Good feedback. Right now we've had 5 potential investors not respond after
receiving our current deck and four investors (or connectors to investors)
ask for a new deck before they pass it on. Agreed we need to get to the
conversation, but the current deck doesn't appear to be doing that.

I'll incorporate your changes + the fin model update as soon as I get it!
