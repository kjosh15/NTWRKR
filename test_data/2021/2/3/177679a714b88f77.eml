Thanks, Kaia! Interestingly, I think www.indigometrics.com might be a
better fit for Osmosis - the platform measures how behavior changes in
response to training material like what Osmosis produces. Let me know if
you think there's a conversation to be had there!

Otherwise I'd love to see the graphic narrative about living through the
pandemic - we ended up moving to Iceland, so I'm always curious to hear how
other people managed this crazy transition.

All best,
Josh
