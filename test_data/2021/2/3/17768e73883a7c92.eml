 Gustavo,

Hope you and Etukai are doing well. I wanted to check in and see if the
check had cleared, if you'd heard anything new from the landlord, and on
next steps.

Top on my list are:

- Do you have enough boxes and/or a timeline on the Harvard Classics?
Wanted to know if I should keep some $$ set aside for the shipment.

- Let me know how/if I can help support Weena and Lee doing a walkthrough.

- Where do you stand on stuff you want to keep? IIR, you were going to make
a list.

- Similarly, off the back of that we can make a list of stuff to sell.
Obviously I'm keen to get that started sooner rather than later, but I know
you're juggling a lot of priorities.

Let me know where you stand and what we can do to move these things
forward.

All best wishes,
Josh
