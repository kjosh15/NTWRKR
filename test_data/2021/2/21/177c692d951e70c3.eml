Great talking to you as well Josh!   Thank you for the deck and the links.
  We will be able to sit down and go through them this week.   Re #2 - yes,
should be.   We will need to work out a "series" of topics or discussions.
 Might work if we set it up like a curriculum.  Does that make sense?
Best,
Rachel
