Hi Josh,

I'm going to give this some thought, we do have a few smart junior
candidates who might be a fit for this, and I'll talk to my team about
passing them your way. Maybe you can hire them on a contract till you can
afford to bring them on full-time? Do you have some money to give them a
salary of sorts?

Best,
Sonali

on getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is an ability to=
 be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep learning curves.<br>=
<br>The upside is that we&#39;re currently working on DE&amp;I with the big=
gest construction firm in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 50=
0 companies on a separate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest that I know o=
f. If we get it we&#39;ll be helping create systemic, public accountability=
 for much if not most of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel like we&#39;d=
 really benefit from some more diverse representation in our team!!<br><br>=
A year ago I wouldn&#39;t have expected to be here, but the shift to distri=
buted workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We&#39;re seeing appet=
ites increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sharp to join th=
e team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about your fee struc=
ture and how we could get started?<br><br>Finally - how the hell are you?? =
It&#39;s been a long time, and a weird year. Let me know if you&#39;re game=
 for a short call just to catch up some time!!<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br>=
