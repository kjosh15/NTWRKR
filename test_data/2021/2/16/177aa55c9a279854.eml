Hey, good to hear from you!

It's over freezing now, so I'm not in danger of losing my lungs. Actually,
that's not what was in real danger of frostbite, TBH, but either way it's a
relief.

+1 on a shitty February. We're hunkered down here trying to figure out
where to live come Feb; my eldest son is getting bored out of his skull at
the school he's at so it's looking like we'll have to move somewhere, but
we're still trying to recover from losing all our income last year so have
limited choices. We'll see what comes - until then ongoing massive
uncertainty seems like the (ongoing) order of the day...!

Totally agreed about a spring plan. I really like this idea, and think it
makes great sense to stoke the fires on folks who haven't deployed yet. If
you and I can both get a box up that could provide good fodder for
attention.

To that end I'm still waiting for the principle of my kids' former school
to find the crowbox there so I can have it sent to me. I'm at their mercy
as they have the cameras and everything, and, well, it's still a pandemic.

The ravens are getting more and more comfortable/dependent. They're also
weirdly picky - they like bread, but not rice crackers, love liver or blood
sausage but didn't touch the reindeer heart or sheet head I put out. My
guess is they'd been poisoned with the latter in the past or something...
or maybe they just only ever get rotten foods. :/

That's all the news here - still trying to see if a Series A makes sense
for Indigometrics and looking for more contract work at the same time. Good
news is there have been 0 cases of Covid in Iceland for more than a week
now... so that's good!

How about you all? Did you ever get your barn doors fixed? And what about
your septic situation?
