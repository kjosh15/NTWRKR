Sounds good. I'm targeting women and minorities specifically as I think
that's going to be central to our success, esp. in the near term. Do you
have a plan for optimizing for this?

Separately, I forwarded the email address to chris@indigometrics.com as
you're distributing first - let me know if you want me to take it or if you
want it to have its own mailbox.

Finally, I will reach out to my contacts by EOW to see where else to
distribute this, and have asked to move up my mtg. w/ the woman from the
Bronx in the meantime.
