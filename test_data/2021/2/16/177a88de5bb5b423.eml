>Thanks, Gustavo. I=E2=80=99d suggest emailing the landlord to ask about a =
lease. Reid (<a href=3D"mailto:reid@canvaspg.com" target=3D"_blank">reid@ca=
nvaspg.com</a>) is the contact at the management company we worked with; ev=
en if that=E2=80=99s not your long term intention it=E2=80=99s a good place=
 to engage. Do you know when the check arrived, and have you called the ban=
k to confirm it=E2=80=99s not cashed yet? (I ask as sometimes it takes a wh=
ile for the funds transfer to show up.)<br><br>I=E2=80=99m booked with call=

=99d)<br><br>In the meantime, please let us know about:<br><br>- Do you hav=
e enough boxes and a timeline on the Harvard Classics? I know you&#39;ve go=
t a lot on your plate but want to get everything else out that you don&#39;=
t need!<br><br>- Let me know how/if I can help get Weena and Lee in for a w=
alkthrough; they=E2=80=99re both waiting to hear from you and should be abl=
e to help with getting stuff out of your way.<br><br>- Where do you stand o=
n the list of stuff you want to keep? If it&#39;s minimal or uncertain that=
&#39;s fine, but having a rough place to start will help us with...<br><br>=
- a list of stuff to sell. It&#39;s almost halfway through the month, and i=
t&#39;ll take a while to offer things to people, arrange time for pickups, =
etc. Again, we&#39;ve got a shortlist off the top of our head but it&#39;d =
be helpful to know what/if you want anything first.=C2=A0<br><br>We hope yo=
