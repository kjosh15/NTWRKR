Matt,

I reviewed the shopping agreement I recently signed with a separate company
and came up with more questions then answers. That said, I think I have a
general idea of what I'd like to see in an agreement:

Your production company and my LLC work in partnership to develop and pitch
the C-Side show idea. If we're able to secure funding, we'll split
development efforts to serialize the show, with a subset of total profits
set aside for 3rd party participants (including EPs). If at any point
either party wants to leave the project we should have ownership %'s worked
out.

In terms of the work, I'm happy to leave final creative decisions in your
hands (as this is your biggest prerequisite!) but would like to see strong
financial assurances in exchange and would like to split business and
financial decisions going forward.

Other questions are around:

Term; how long to shop the project?
Obligations/ownership beyond the term?
Titles?
Copyrights?
Development expenses and insurances?
Assignments to other parties?

and, of course %'s of ownership (and splits for EPs, etc.)

Let me know if this is a useful starting point!

All best,
Josh
