Weena's # is 646-418-6399.

Lee is a friend of ours; her husband is Maz, who picked up the emergency
supplies. Her # is 646-327-3086, and she's available tomorrow. Can you
arrange a time with her directly?

Let me know when you have the books packed and I can create a shipping
label for you. If you get it to me by EOD today I can have it ready for you
by tomorrow morning (or Thursday morning if you get it to me by EOD
tomorrow) so you can ship it out before you leave town.

Finally, let me know what's on the list of things you want to buy so we can
think through how to sell the rest.

All best wishes to you all!
Josh
