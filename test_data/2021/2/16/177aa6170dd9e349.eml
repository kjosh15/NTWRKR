So cool! good to see you've been super busy. What kind of work are you
looking to do more of now?

Haven't been back to Helsinki in years, but as I'm now based in Iceland it
may happen sooner rather than later!

Happy to connect; do any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work?

Veristable looks super interesting, BTW. Would be curious how they're
looking to grow!

All best,
Josh
