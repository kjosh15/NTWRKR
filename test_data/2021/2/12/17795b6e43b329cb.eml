All good. We're a little concerned as we now have about two weeks to get
everything identified and sold, but I think if we focus quickly we can
probably manage. We've contacted Lee and Weena about Sunday, and Lee is out
of town - is there another time this coming week that works for you?

Separately, hit me with a list of stuff you want to keep, if anything, and
tell me how many boxes the Harvard Classics fill so I can send you a
shipping label.

All best,
Josh
