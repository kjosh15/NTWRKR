Genius!! Very curious to hear how the conversation goes.

AFAIK they're having a "restructuring" internally, which is probably
following the explosive growth of their DE&I group off the back of the G100
purchase. If you tell me what the opp Mike brought up was I can offer more
color, but there are so many ways you could contribute I'm not sure where
to start. Any hints?

All best wishes,
Josh
