Howdy! Two small updates:

1) I'm still very focused on raising funds for Indigometrics, either VC or
(preferably) CVC. Any advice/introductions/suggestions are appreciated!

2) I've been having a blast hosting Accenture's new business podcast and
have made a bunch of contacts in business podcasting; do you know anyone
with an interest in starting up a corporate podcast?

Otherwise I hope you and yours are well and in line for vaccines soon (if
you've not received them already)!

All best wishes,
Josh
