TL;DR: For Haakon, the app (if we could get an iPad that would really help)
is everything in one place with an adaptive path to steer him.

For Othinn, there's a whole curriculum. We could support him in digging
deeper into subjects he's interested in (set goals, track progress, find
support, etc.) or create a whole supplementary curriculum.
