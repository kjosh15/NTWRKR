Super interesting... AFAIK internal structure has different leads for each
group (Mike owns Innovating 50, for example, to which I'm a special
advisor) with a bunch of support staff tasked to different events,
initiatives, or corporate functions. As you know they recently expanded
with the help of some significant funding and absorbed G100 - no idea what
that's done to their internal org. chart but based on how long the current
re-org has been taking it's been as messy as you'd expect.

This is all hypothetical, obvs. - I haven't talked to Mike since the
merger, and he didn't mention he was going to contact you. Still, nice to
know the intro stuck with him!

Sorry I can't be of more help - happy to compare notes after the call, in
any case!!

All best wishes,
Josh
