Really not sure what the trouble is here; we've given you the address
multiple times now. At this point it has been many weeks since our fitbit
spontaneously caught on fire - we'd really like a replacement! Let us know
what else you need to get this resolved.

Again, our address is:

Vidifell
607 Akureyri
Iceland

Thanks very much,
Josh Klein
