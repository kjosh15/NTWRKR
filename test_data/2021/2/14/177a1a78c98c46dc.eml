Thanks for the call Gustavo, and as ever best wishes to your family! Let me
know how/if we can be of any other help going forward.

In the meantime, I heard that we=E2=80=99re going to get the books shipped =
out this
week, will try to have Weena and Lee come by Wednesday or Thursday, and
that you=E2=80=99ll get us a list of things you want to buy (and will do so=
me
thinking about how to sell the rest). Let me know if I misunderstood
anything!

All best wishes,
Josh
