We should be profitable enough by the end of April to afford a couple FT
junior roles, so we'd probably want to start with salary. That said, these
are junior roles so the pay won't be huge (i.e., less than $70k/year), and
we're also looking in the UK which is weirdly much cheaper (like half
that.) Not sure how that fits your remit or if we're smoking crack
w/regards to NYC - any feedback appreciated.

We're also looking at the depressing reality of hiring in 2021 with two
white, male candidates for the junior DevOps role basically appearing by
accident (friends of friends or nephews of investor contacts, etc.) so I'm
happy to start any conversations we can which might lead to better
representation on our team before we just fill them with what's in front of
us.

Let me know what you suggest for next steps. Also, any luck on finding that
hiring material? I'm really chewing on what I'm going to ask these
people!!! :)

Gratefully,
Josh
