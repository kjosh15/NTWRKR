Hi Josh, thanks for the meeting.
So, two things:
1) Since you are working with startups in Iceland that might need
resources (project based or employee based) we do make referral contracts
as Noemi was talking about. For Nordics (including Iceland) this would be
me. For me it does not matter much if we sign such a contract now or later
when you actually have a case that might fit. "=C3=9Eetta reddast" as you
probably know by now from the Icelandic culture :)

2) And then the strategic part, there is a lot to take in from your
website. I would like to sell your service in partnership as i believe it
can add value for both parties (me selling your service, you adding to my
portfolio of local talent/advisory)
If we could package some of your core "products", basically for me to be
able to do presales when meeting customers to generate interest, and then
get you to go over details etc.
Could you maybe sum up some of your skills you think might be of value?
Then we would try to make a one pager/one slide i could talk about.

Additionally i would have you in mind when there are conferences etc.

How is your availability next few days for a call?

Looking forward to work with you


Here is the hotel

And here are the Americans that run the restaurant (from Portland).
