Hey Aimee!! I hope you and Rupert are doing well, wherever you are - is
that still the UK, or did you head back to the US? We're now fully
ensconced in Iceland and the last of our stuff from NYC arrives by boat
early next month. So we're now officially refugees, albeit with some pretty
glamorous conditions for a pandemic... :)

That aside, I had a business question. I've gotten Jaren Lanier at
Microsoft interested in doing an AI-led tv series I co-developed with a
documentary filmmaker friend. My friend's company (XYZ Studios, here) wants
to draw up a basic agreement before we move forward any further; do you
have any feedback on these terms? I don't have a clue what to look for!!!


   - I wanted to check with you a few contractual points, which are as
   follows:
   - XYZ Studios LLC and Josh Klein=E2=80=99s LLC work together to create a=
n
   AI-themed series.
   - XYZ will lead editorial and creative decisions.
   - Josh will lead the technological efforts.
   - The two LLC=E2=80=99s will work together on business development, plan=
ning and
   production.
   - The pool breakdown of financial returns and ownership on the project
   will be 40/60 with Josh=E2=80=99s LLC and XYZ claiming the 60%. Of that =
60%, XYZ
   will hold 65%, as XYZ is bearing the brunt of show development, time, an=
d
   costs.
   - As reflected in the previous documents, Matt will hold an EP and
   directing credit on the project. Josh will hold a producer and lead
   technologist credit.
   - The last open or first end credit will read =E2=80=9CCreated by Matt D=
anzico /
   Josh Klein=E2=80=9D
   - Development expenses, outside those already put in by XYZ, will be put
   forward by investors, a network, or other outside parties.
   - Investors have the opportunity to come in as additional EPs.


Any thoughts/suggestions are appreciated. Let me know what you all are up
to and of course if I can ever return the favor!

Gratefully,
Josh
