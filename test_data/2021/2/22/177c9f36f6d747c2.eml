Another model.

The more feedback I get about how small we are the more nimbe I think we
can be; again, taking funding under a note (i.e., angel/seed) offers much
better terms than a Series A, and alternative formats (such as an equity
backed loan) offer potentially better forms of risk.

Not changing our current strategy, but def. keeping my eyes open as we go.
