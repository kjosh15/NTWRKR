iv dir=3D"ltr">A little update for ya. Good call yesterday with them. Mike w=
asn't on the call but Jake and Jessica were great. Got a bit more insight in=
to their structure and slew of acquisitions&nbsp;over the past year.&nbsp; S=
ounds like things are leveling off a bit. They were very self-aware that the=
y are hard to make out as an org from the outside. Kind of like SXSW in a wa=
y. Now that they're bigger and more complex they're looking through 2021 to 2=
022 in how they engage all their communities.<div><br></div><div>It feels li=
ke a solid fit and I'd think they would agree as well. Definitely&nbsp;an ev=
ents/editorial/experiential&nbsp;play in some shape across all they do. Thou=
gh they were transparent in they were not ready to hire just yet. Maybe some=
 project-based stuff, but really in their court on that. But seems like some=
 opportunities across their yearly summits and virtual events. As they put i=
t, "there aren't a lot of people out there who know how to do what you do".&=
nbsp;<div><br></div><div>So good stuff. Would love your take. Seems like a g=
ood culture and work fit. Maybe you could give Mike a little nudge for me? ;=
