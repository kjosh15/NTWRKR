Chelsea,

Sounds super interesting, and I have no doubt your ideas are anything but
dumb - it's really encouraging to hear about some deeper and more
far-ranging considerations on the topic of leadership! I've co-hosting a
podcast on Accenture's views on the future of business and it's so
frustrating to see so much of it just make sense... and not be absorbed by
so many large companies for the reasons you've described.

That said, we're currently starting with Wharton's People Analytics team on
the topic of coachability in leadership, so I should probably put a lid on
our conversations reg. until I know what they're going to ask to not have
shared. That said, once all is clear I trust we'll have plenty to talk
about! Keep me posted, and let's stay in touch reg.!!

All best,
Josh
