Here's one I thought you might have a quick answer on - any advice for how
to do Due Diligence for new hires that will be handling sensitive
information? My co-founder and I are arguing about whether to get them
work-specific laptops, what background checks to run, etc. Do you have a
strong opinion?

Otherwise I'm booking time on your calendar shortly. More to discuss!!

I hope you and yours are well,
Josh
