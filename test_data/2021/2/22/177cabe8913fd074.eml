Chris,

Had two very good investment calls today; the former (with Christopher
Schroeder) for the introductions it's producing (Village Capital included)
and the latter for insight into the industry.

More on the former when we speak Thursday, but the latter was with
Launch.co about their demo day. I was introduced by Mark Silva - a very
warm intro - so I think the information I gathered is as close to their
guardrails as possible.

We never even got what Indigometrics does. Up front the person staffed with
interviewing me asked:

- What is your MRR
- How much of your round have you closed already?
- Who is your lead investor with?

Hint: we didn't fit. They want (at minimum):

- $50K+ MRR, more like $100
- significant month over month growth
- 30% of round closed w/ a lead investor (big name is better)
- $500k of the round secured

Beyond that, when I asked, they also look for "a great product, great team,
and a solid world class thing with potential for scale."

They closed by pointing out that they run demo day once a month, so please
do keep in touch and let's talk again when our numbers are better.

Informative.
- J
