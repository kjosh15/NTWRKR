Hey Mike,

Just spoke to Todd Hansen, who I suggested to you guys an era ago, about
his recent call with Jake and Jessica. Wanted to follow up with my 100%
endorsement - I've worked with him *many* times while he was at SXSW over
the course of the last decade and he's fabulous. Particular strengths (to
my mind!) are around cutting-edge improvements to your event/gathering
ecosystem and content/editorial advising across virtual events.

Just wanted to throw my hand up to say I'm super excited you both are
chatting. Let me know if I can be of any help reg.!

All best,
Josh
