Thanks Josh! I=E2=80=99m not sure where it will go but when I heard we were
potentially looking for event/programming experience, his name came to mind
for me. So thanks for the intro.

Sorry I=E2=80=99ve been bad at responding lately... I=E2=80=99ve taken on s=
ome new
responsibilities and struggle to balance.

To answer one question that I missed... we internally call you Special
Advisor to Innovating but I=E2=80=99m certainly not married to that for any=
thing
externally facing. You could say something like Innovation and Technology
Advisor to World 50 - or something like that?

Mike
