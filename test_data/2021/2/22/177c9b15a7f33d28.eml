Brilliant!! Dots are connecting. In response:

- 23&Me for plants yes yes yes yes. Also, what about the various seed banks
around the world, or pitch it to Monsanto if Scotts doesn't bite?
- I know the guy that designed Leafly.com - he'd be ideal on this.
- Constellation Brands is one of two alcohol distributors in the USA and
they're SUPER interesting in marijuana (obvs.).

Any other ideas to potentially pitch? I love these and could totally see
making a deck to try to get buyers in... Corporate Client/CVC/JV is such a
nicer route than VC!!
