Josh,

Thank you for your patience.

We apologize for the delay in response to your support request. 

It appears that a few of the networks that your connection passes through have some latency, and would definitely contribute to the slowness in reaching your files.

I would highly recommend looking into a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to resolve your issue. A CDN would distribute your site from various data centers around the world, so that your connection doesn't have to travel all the way directly to our Los Angeles data center. We offer an in-house option powered by Sucuri that comes with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional security and a built-in SSL Certificate option for up to 5 domains for $30 per month.

In case you'd like a little more information on our CDN, we have our service page here:
https://mediatemple.net/services/cdn-waf

Alternatively, there are third party options like CloudFlare for example, who have a free plan that you can take advantage of. 

Please let me know if there's anything else I can answer for you regarding the information in this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services. We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Stephen T.
Customer Support Lead @ (mt) Media Temple
