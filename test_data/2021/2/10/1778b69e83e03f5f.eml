Mike,

Excellent seeing you yesterday; always a great conversation with this team!=
!

I wanted to update my LinkedIn profile (and website) w/ W50. What should I
call myself? I've heard "Special Advisor," "Innovation Advisor" or "Subject
Matter Expert." Is there an official moniker?

Otherwise Carl Haney and Stephen Revnew both asked me about data privacy +
AR/VR recently and as a result I ended up spending some time talking with
both Jaron Lanier and Chris Milk, if that's of interest. Always happy to
chat.

Hope you and yours are doing well - interesting times!!

All best,
Josh
