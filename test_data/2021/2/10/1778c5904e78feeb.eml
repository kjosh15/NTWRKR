Thanks, Gustavo. I=E2=80=99d suggest emailing the landlord to ask about a l=
ease.
Reid (reid@canvaspg.com) is the contact at the management company we worked
with; even if that=E2=80=99s not your long term intention it=E2=80=99s a go=
od place to
engage. Do you know when the check arrived, and have you called the bank to
confirm it=E2=80=99s not cashed yet? (I ask as sometimes it takes a while f=
or the
funds transfer to show up.)

I=E2=80=99m booked with calls today until 11pm my time (!!) maybe you can c=
onnect
with Hulda? (Cc=E2=80=99d)

In the meantime, please let us know about:

- Do you have enough boxes and a timeline on the Harvard Classics? I know
you've got a lot on your plate but want to get everything else out that you
don't need!

- Let me know how/if I can help get Weena and Lee in for a walkthrough;
they=E2=80=99re both waiting to hear from you and should be able to help wi=
th
getting stuff out of your way.

- Where do you stand on the list of stuff you want to keep? If it's minimal
or uncertain that's fine, but having a rough place to start will help us
with...

- a list of stuff to sell. It's almost halfway through the month, and it'll
take a while to offer things to people, arrange time for pickups, etc.
Again, we've got a shortlist off the top of our head but it'd be helpful to
know what/if you want anything first.

We hope you guys are doing well!!

All best,
Josh
