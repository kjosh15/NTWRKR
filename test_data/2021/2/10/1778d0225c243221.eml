Hi Josh,

I just realized that the first time we connected was back in 2015. It's
nice to see your name pop up.

I have been booked in back to back meetings, but I would be happy to hear
your thoughts in more detail. We are not building applications for clients
at the moment, but we do focus on websites and web optimization. We produce
a lot of content, design, and campaigns. What specifically are you looking
for / focusing on lately?

Jonathan
