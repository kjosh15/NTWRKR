Looks like my magazine interview may lead to another good audience:

"The Conference Board=E2=80=99s Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Exec=
utives
Council
<https://www.conference-board.org/councils/global-diversity-equity-and-incl=
usion-executives>,
which counts among its members the DE&I leaders of companies like 3M, Bank
of America, Coca-Cola, GM, Pfizer, Twitter and Walt Disney, to name a few
of the icon brands represented, collectively represents/impacts over 6
million jobs/employees. I think that could be a really interesting
discussion."

Fingers' crossed. Now to get some funding to support the inbound attention
that'll prompt, AND to publish an article/case study to help validate the
interest, and ...
