FWIW I checked our analytics and by far the most traffic is to the
ReviewDashboard.aspx page; i.e., our dashboard wasn't reporting on the

I inserted it and we should have tracking data in a few days. (This way we
can see if/when investors are checking the investor section and/or viewing
our videos!)
