Hi Josh,

Attached is the Stranger Things treatment. The file name indicates that it=
=E2=80=99s the show bible. But this is what they used as the treatment as w=
ell.

I also attached the first page of the News of Doom treatment. That=E2=80=99=
s my other series. You can see the level of design, detail, and them on bot=
h.=20

A =E2=80=9Cstoryboard=E2=80=9D isn=E2=80=99t typically something that=E2=80=
=99s included in a treatment. That=E2=80=99s something that comes a lot lat=
er.

But we could have one made for C-Side / Another Side. In fact, there is a s=
how breakdown page in the Another Side document already that I created.

Matt
