This is super useful; if I'm hearing you right, the avenue to hosting new
podcasts is to come up with the idea or to begin with the end customer -
not to work with producers. So I'm better off talking to business leaders
and/or suggesting ideas for podcasts to them directly. Am I getting that
right?

Thanks so much, Ann!!

All best,
Josh
