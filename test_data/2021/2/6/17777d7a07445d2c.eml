Hmmm, that=E2=80=99s a tough one with a lot of different answers.

It sounds like you=E2=80=99re doing branded podcasts, so that route is to ju=
st keep making the connections you have.

When it comes to hosting, places are looking for ideas and not hosts (unless=
 you=E2=80=99re a celebrity) so the best thing to do is to have a podcast id=
ea and start pitching it around.

Does that make sense?
Ann
