They can keep trying... something tells me it isn't a great market!

I'm loving the podcast and now have a great setup w/ equipment, space, and
internet. I'd like to do more! I'm exclusive to Accenture against their
competitors (they sent a list) but that certainly doesn't preclude other
industries or topics. I was curious if you had any tips on who to talk to
about emerging/prospective podcasts that I could help co/host.

I.e., based on everything I've heard so far there's LOTS people who want to
host podcasts, so it usually comes down to who you have relationships with.
As you said I'm hopeful that I'm well positioned in terms of
brand/experience/etc., but I don't know who to talk to about podcasts in
development that I don't know about. Any suggestions or introductions you
think would be worthwhile?

Otherwise let me know how I can help in turn; you've always been such a big
help in this department I'd love to return the favor!

All best wishes from snowy Iceland,
Josh
