Bjorgvin,

Long time no speak! We recently moved to Iceland (Fnj=C3=B3skadalur) and ar=
e in
need of someone to record a sizzle reel for a TV series pitch. It's a basic
seated-with-darkened-background piece to camera. The producer is in NYC; do
you know any video engineers who would be interested in the project here?

I hope you and yours are well!

Kv.,
Josh
