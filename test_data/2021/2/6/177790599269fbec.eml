Ok, that=E2=80=99s enormously helpful - and a crazy amount of work. I can s=
ee why
you suggested we=E2=80=99d need a couple days to put one together.

I=E2=80=99m still not convinced that the best next step shouldn=E2=80=99t b=
e a more
complete storyboard for Jaron. TBH I=E2=80=99d love to cement his buy-in th=
rough
building things out more, and suspect that if we got Trevor Noah involved
any treatment would be substantially revamped in any case.

Then again, that could be my overworked brain attempting to excuse itself.
Let=E2=80=99s talk Tuesday!
