The first (research) release would still send the raw data to make sure ther=
e are models worth training in the first place. I was thinking to piggyback t=
he privacy features for a later product that would track many body functions=
 and come up with a holistic model (=E2=80=9CThe whole body ...=E2=80=9D). T=
hat would include all kinds of dynamic data (movements, maybe even calendar a=
nd mail ...), and static data (DNA). This would be very intrusive even witho=

The FDA has introduced an expedited certification process for mobile consume=
r applications as long as no snake oil is sold (Apple watch and Fitbit e.g. t=
rack heart rates etc.). Depending on the funding one could aim for a consume=
r and a pro version of the app with different levels of certification. Defin=
itively for the latter or any real medical use case one would need a strong p=
artner with industry experience (like a hospital chain, a pharmaceutical com=
pany, etc.)

Two-sided market (as with all fintech I guess):
- consumer: The unbanked who nevertheless have a smartphone (i.e. c. 2 billi=
on people)
- institutional: Probably national banks, big banks in South Asia or Africa.=
 I did three concept projects (only powerpoint sadly), one for the Senegales=
e government, and one for the World Bank for East Timor, and one for the lar=
gest Bank here in Abu Dhabi. What I learned is that there is need, but they d=
on=E2=80=99t know what to do; and BCG/McKinsey/... don=E2=80=99t really help=
.=20
Another type of clients is organisations that struggle with trust and accoun=
tability; basically everybody who gets donations or government funds to dist=
ribute. Tansania e.g. had a big tender out to develop a distribution system f=
or their social benefits. It is just a pain to get those grants. I used to w=
ork with an interesting guy on these things: Emerson Tan who had started his=
 p2p payment system =E2=80=98Mautinoa=E2=80=99 after hacking together such a=
 platform in Sierra Leone (Interesting story. Emerson worked in the Ebola re=
lief team and at one point things became so bad that they wouldn=E2=80=99t g=
et the cash delivered anymore to pay the nurses and local staff. So he built=
 this credit card platform). We tried to sell that to Senegal, but it took t=
o long). Everything in fintech requires significant legal work. But I think o=
nce you are in, you stay.
