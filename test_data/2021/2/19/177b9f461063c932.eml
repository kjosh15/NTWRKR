Chris,

Apologies in advance; I'm trying to figure out what to do about announcing
ownership of Indigometrics shares to the IRS and need some additional info.
Can you revert:


   1. My percentage owned each year 2017-2019
   2. Was the current value about the same 2017-2019?
   3. What was the highest value of bank accounts where I had signature
   authority?


I have an accountant competing for my business who may be able to give me a
quick answer if I get this info to him quickly. Any chance you could dig
this up before the weekend?

Much obliged,
Josh
