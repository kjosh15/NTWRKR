Hi friend!

This is AMAZING! I feel like so much of what indigometrics is strongly
correlates with what I *hope* to unlock or further elucidate in my
dissertation.

I'm just now knee-deep in the research process trying to better understand
capacity in a leadership space. More specifically, I want to look at how
leadership acts as a portrayal for individuals and organizations that may
transcend their current situations to realize new potential opportunities
by, in theory, initiating three capacities that shift change: absorptive
capacity (ie., diversity, meaning making, and slack), adaptive capacity
(placing emphasis on learning and asking the right questions), and
generative capacity (developing a design mindset guided by abduction--the
logic of potentiality).

I'm still trying to build my conceptual framework, so I haven't quite
thought about how to measure all of this yet or even who my participants
will be. It's possible that enough banging my head against the wall will
allow me to realize my idea is dumb and instead invest in something else. I
would LOVE any ideas you can throw at me or any information you may have in
the general space of capacity or bettering leadership in corporate spaces.
I could definitely use a different pair of eyes/brains on this, if not just
to bring some level of sanity back into my life.

Hope all is well!

Chels
