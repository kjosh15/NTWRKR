$.5mm seems reasonable given our current estimates. My frustration is that
I'm often coming up against $1mm as a minimum for conversations with
serious funders.

That said, I don't want to overstate, get interest, and then get called out
- a soured relationship is worse than one that we can come back to, esp. as
I am learning that all the top funders share notes extensively.

So yes, let's stick with $.5mm with the knowledge that we could see a big
spike in that. (I.e., if Bechtel decides to go cross-company, etc.)
