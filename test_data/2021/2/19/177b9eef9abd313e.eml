Joerg,

Excellent thinking here! Exciting stuff; questions inline, below:

What sort of federated learning results would you expect from the system
you propose? I.e., as it stands now computation is against preprogrammed
models which return standardized results optimized for diabetics (ignoring
the fact that the disease manifests differently among individuals as you
noted.) The privacy element seems interesting, but only in service of
improved results over time, which seems somewhat counter to the above.

That said, I *love* the idea of funding a prototype... but am concerned
about the legal requirements to develop a medical device / obtain materials
for software experimentation. Thoughts?

Fully agreed. Who would your ideal customer be and why?

Happy to, with the caveat that we are currently pitching him on our own
project and would want to wait until he is completely embedded. ;) Can you
send me a couple-sentence summary to use in introducing the project and
yourself?

Much obliged,
Josh
