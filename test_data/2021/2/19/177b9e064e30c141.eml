Thanks, Laura!

Let me loop back with my cofounder on the radio show. Thanks so much for
the invite!

Monday is probably too soon for the white paper, especially if we wanted to
pull together data from a live client. Next time!

Let me know who your Chair of the Management dept suggests for
collaboration on D&I. I now have a couple conversations coming up which
might be relevant.

I liked your point about strengths; as in, it reflects internal tendencies
but is not immutable. For that reason internally we've been promoting state
instead of trait... but now we'll have to go back and consider strengths...
(!!)

All best,
Josh

question is whether we could discuss your work looking through a gender

and then air in our usual time slot on Thursdays at 9 am ET (and replaying
at various points in the week). The shows then live on as podcasts. What do
you think?  Could be scheduled at any point when you have bandwidth and
would like some visibility-

I=E2=80=99ll fill you in when we talk! To that end, how does next week look=
 for
you? Any chance you have time on Thursday- maybe 10 am ET or after?
Hopefully that=E2=80=99s not too late in the day for you. Otherwise, the 15=

gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Three follow ups:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0=
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) I wanted to loop back around on the introduction to you=
r contact about the white paper (as we have a client who is interested in d=
etermining if they have suitable data for a submission).=C2=A0 I just reali=
zed that the abstract deadline is this week- but if we could have an abstra=
ct by Monday am we can make sure it=E2=80=99s considered. Here=E2=80=99s th=
e link to the info and the place to submit. Just in case they close it to e=
ntries, please send a copy to me and I will make sure they review it.<br>&g=
t;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2) Similarly, it would be useful to conne=
ct to your profession working on D&amp;I. I&#39;m going to be speaking to a=
 c-suite executive of color next week who has a keen interest in the topic.=
 We&#39;re going to discuss the potential for partnering on D&amp;I as a sp=
ecial project and wanted to be able to reference her work. It would also be=
 useful to have a gauge on her interest beforehand. I=E2=80=99m waiting to =
hear back from the Chair of the Management dept, will make intros to the de=
signated folks as soon as I do!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3) F=
inally, a one-off to settle an argument between my co-founder and I: do you=
 see coachability as a trait, or a state? We have devoted so much time to d=
ebating how to label it- and all the other ones we are focusing on like gri=
t, generosity, integrity, etc. Seriously- it=E2=80=99s been a major ongoing=
 discussion!. We landed on referring to them as =E2=80=9Cstrengths=E2=80=99=
 with the idea that strengths can be developed. =E2=80=9CTraits=E2=80=9D se=
em immutable. And while we didn=E2=80=99t consider =E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 =
I=E2=80=99d apply the same reasoning that it feels easier to tap into a str=
ength than it does to change your state. Where did you land?<br>&gt;<br>&gt=
; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Lots of activity going on; we just signed another =
large multinational yesterday and today signed a very large blue-collar wor=
kforce (the London Fire Brigade), demonstrating the applicability of the pl=
atform across the full organizational stack. That=E2=80=99s awesome!!There =
are so many interesting challenges to examine here!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<=
