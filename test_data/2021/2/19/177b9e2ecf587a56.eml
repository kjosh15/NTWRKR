Chris,

My contact at Wharton's People Analytics team invited me to her podcast to
discuss Indigometrics through a gender lens:

https://businessradio.wharton.upenn.edu/women-at-work/

Makes my spider-sense tingle, but can't see it as being bad press if we can
think of some substantive things to say. Have a think and lets' discuss
Monday.

Separately, reg. coachability as a trait, or a state, she said:

"We have devoted so much time to debating how to label it- and all the
other ones we are focusing on like grit, generosity, integrity, etc.
Seriously- it=E2=80=99s been a major ongoing discussion!. We landed on refe=
rring to
them as =E2=80=9Cstrengths=E2=80=99 with the idea that strengths can be dev=
eloped. =E2=80=9CTraits=E2=80=9D
seem immutable. And while we didn=E2=80=99t consider =E2=80=98state=E2=80=
=99 I=E2=80=99d apply the same
reasoning that it feels easier to tap into a strength than it does to
change your state."

FYI!
