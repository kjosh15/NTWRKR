Understood. Excited as well. I'll prioritize accordingly, as this means =
I have two days or more of work ahead of me. Happy to be the one putting =
in the time up front, but I first have to figure out how that is then =
balanced out between us contractually. I have a meeting today with my =
producer. So I=E2=80=99ll start on the contract bits with her and let =
her take that over for me. I=E2=80=99ll have her reach out.

Then in the days ahead, I=E2=80=99ll look at the treatment again. Be =
back soon.
