Well, that's good to hear. I'm full of fresh perspectives.

RE: you and I talking about all of this. I think we can just play it like
it is. We're friends and the connection between you and Mike had me come to
you to get your take and help me understand World 50 better. They
are admittedly a bit mysterious so it's only logical that I'd do some
digging.

Engagement ideas could be:

   - Content/editorial advising across the types of virtual events they are
   running. Finding new voices or topics that may feel a bit fringe but hel=
p
   stoke conversation and new thinking for their members. Try to unlock som=
e
   new formats their members may find valuable. Kind of look at their
   framework around that stuff and see how it can be improved/changed. Figu=
re
   out ways to pull from their community what they need/want/desire to
   learn/connect with/understand. I think that last piece is a big issue fo=
r
   them. I think they get a lot of dead air from the community members on
   that.

   - Taking a look at their event/gathering ecosystem and see what could be
   rethought, amplified, or tossed as they look through 2021 to 2022. Virtu=
al
   is here to stay but people will get back together in-person. Putting som=
e
   thought into figuring out that balance could be of value by looking
   horizontally across the organization across their legacy and new
   acquisitions. Having someone kind of sitting on top of this stuff with t=
he
   freedom to plot and plan scenarios for consideration, I think, would sup=
er
   helpful as they settle into the re-org. My gut says they've probably had
   the same playbook for a while. Maybe it's time to inject some new ideas.

Those are a couple of ideas that come to mind. If I have an opportunity to
pull back some layers with them, I can see something getting carved out.

Thanks for helping to nudge them along!

T.
