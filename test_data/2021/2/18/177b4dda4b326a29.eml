Misha,

 

To follow up on our call yesterday, this is a list of our integration asks
(we have more details if/when needed).

 

MSGraph
Confirmed that https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/people-example is the
approach we currently use. We are used to being granted access via being set
up as an Application in your Azure directory and then receiving a Client
secret to get access. We then have code at our end that filters the response
such that we only take pairs of interactions that are within our perimeter.
We ping this API every week for individuals within our perimeter.

 

HR System (SAP)
The ask here is to receive via API details of everyone that works in a
specific division. Fields we are after are email, firstname, secondname,
gender, role, team/supervisor - but we are used to a bit of a 2 way
discussion around which fields you have available and that we can use to
populate our database. If possible we would like to receive this via a
reports API or similar. This allows us to ping the API every week to get a
list of current employees and changes in role etc. It also allows us to
quickly onboard a new division simply by expanding the data available to us
in the report API. (Typically we use this feed to update our database every
week and then we use SSO to double check that the participant is still live
when they are asked to log in).

 

SMTP redirect

As a default we use AWS SES to send emails and we have DKIM enabled etc ,
however even with all of these features enabled we still experience periodic
problems with emails dropping into spam. Our ask would be for an account
with redirect privileges on your SMTP server. We know that this is a
difficult ask but it does make the solution more robust - so we can work
around any limitations you may need - such as times in the week that the
redirect is open to us and a limitation to what we can put in the emails.

 

Learning Management System

Question - do you have a Learning Management System where you store the
digital training available to your employees? If so, which LMS do you use
and can we get access to the training directory so that we can automatically
link participants back to relevant training (by providing a url back to your
LMS - we don't host the content ourselves)?

 

Thanks and Regards

 

Chris
