HELL YES. This is *great* news!! And totally agree, you'd be ideal for
this. They really need some fresh perspectives and - as noted - are
juggling some pretty big new things.

Can you let me know if / how I can reference speaking to you about all
this? Happy to nudge Mike and whoever else I can to get this done; did you
have any ideas on where you wanted to start engaging with them so I can
suggest expediting?

Huge congrats - super, super excited to hear all this. You made my night!

All best,
Josh
