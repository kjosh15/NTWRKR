I think Anne bought one of my floating tables....
Here is the description I pitched to Scotts Miracle Gro but they didn't
bite yet. I still want to do it and might have a convo with them again in a
couple weeks but throwing it here just in case and to get your brain going.
I also pitched a couple more data based ideas that we could talk about.


   -

   Plant-Ancestry*** Similar to 23&Me or Ancestry.com this is a system that
   allows a user to send in a DNA sample of their plant to get entered into=
 a
   database and receive information about the history, specific care
   requirements, and plant family  of their plant. The effect would be to
   create visualizations and forums for people to see how they are connecte=
d
   plant parent (similar to breeding info on pets as well) in order to be a=
ble
   to share, spread, and document the flora of the world. SMG would seed th=
e
   database with DNA from historically and geographically famous plants (e.=
g.,
   Joshua tree, jades from dynasties, native plants, plants at Buckingham
   garden, etc.) so that people could see if they are cousins, aunts, etc. =
of
   these specimens. People could find out if they are related to other
   celebrities=E2=80=99 plants (Sting, CardiB, etc.) and SMG could send the=
se out to
   celebs for social media marketing. This is a big data play - even if the=
re
   wasn=E2=80=99t a use for all the data right away, there is definitely a =
long play
   about owning and cataloguing the flora of the world for future generatio=
ns
   and preservation. SMG should open source this.


So the application to weed here would be insane actually. And a way to
track and catalog data about strains. I didn't push this with them (though
I mentioned it) because I felt they were being too stupid to hear that they
could OWN the marijuana growing sector if they were smart. If a company
doesn't seem too responsive to initial suggestions, I tend to like to keep
it to take elsewhere or develop so they then catch on and pay later. :)

Your next avail was March 15 so I set that up. Let me know if you feel like
checking in sooner....already have some other concepts to discuss.
