Adi,

I wanted to follow up on our pitch for a piece on how Bechtel, one of the
biggest construction firms in the world, is using hard data to hold
themselves accountable to materially improving diversity and inclusion.

Again, we are deploying a first-of-its-kind peer-to-peer data gathering
solution to put hard data against the problem, not just once, but
continuously across the entire organization. Initial pilots are showing not
just where problems lie, but how, where, and with whom solutions are having
an impact.

This is one of the first indications that technology and data can actually
help address one of the biggest business issues of our time - if companies
are brave enough to face the data.

Let me know if we can send you an outline (as we are continuously
collecting data and!!) or if this is outside HBR's scope of interest.

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
