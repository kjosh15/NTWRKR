So good catching up - hope to reconnect again sooner rather than later.
I'll keep thinking about where / how / what we could collaborate on, and
obvs. happy to connect you to any corps that could benefit.

In the meantime, check out elizabethhodes.com for cake/sugar/frosting
related matters. She's awesome; we used to volunteer together at a bird
shelter in Manhattan.

All best,
Josh
