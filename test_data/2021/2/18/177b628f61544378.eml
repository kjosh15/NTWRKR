A little update for ya. Good call yesterday with them. Mike wasn't on the
call but Jake and Jessica were great. Got a bit more insight into their
structure and slew of acquisitions over the past year.  Sounds like things
are leveling off a bit. They were very self-aware that they are hard to
make out as an org from the outside. Kind of like SXSW in a way. Now that
they're bigger and more complex they're looking through 2021 to 2022 in how
they engage all their communities.

It feels like a solid fit and I'd think they would agree as well.
Definitely an events/editorial/experiential play in some shape across all
they do. Though they were transparent in they were not ready to hire just
yet. Maybe some project-based stuff, but really in their court on that. But
seems like some opportunities across their yearly summits and virtual
events. As they put it, "there aren't a lot of people out there who know
how to do what you do".

So good stuff. Would love your take. Seems like a good culture and work
fit. Maybe you could give Mike a little nudge for me? ;)

T.
