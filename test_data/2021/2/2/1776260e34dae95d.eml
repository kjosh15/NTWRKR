Dennis,

We met in March 2020 at Think Coffee in what was officially my last
in-person pre-Covid meeting. Congratulations! Two things I wanted to ask
you about:

1. At the time you mentioned you were mostly focused on growing Marsbot. My
contract work these days is mostly spent on retainer to senior executives
of large multinationals, all of whom are starting to gear up looking for
partnerships and platforms they can use to differentiate. Is this worth a
followup conversation?

2. I've got a startup built around metricing and managing corporate culture
which has been blowing up since COVID+BLM (www.indigometrics.com). We're
about to look for a seed round / Series A and I'd love to get your advice.
Would you be willing to do a brief call reg.?

All best,
Josh
