FUCK! That's some cold shit, dude. I think you can die in those
temperatures, right? You gotta be careful about breathing air that cold!

Hey I saw a Crow in someone else's pasture yesterday. He was on the ground,
which is the first time I've seen one down in a pasture so I take that as a
good sign.

I should start putting out peanuts but I have to build a platform first. We
have millions of field mice and I can't be feeding those guys peanuts by
throwing them on the ground.

On the bright side, there are no squirrels here. I haven't seen a single
one. I think the Red-Tailed Hawks and the Bald Eagles see to those guys
pretty quickly. I think they probably stay in the deeper woods that
surround us and stay off the prairies and pastures.

I received the patch for Big Sur, which appears to address my issues so I
think my CAD program is back online and I can look into designing a simple
wooden box that can hold the guts. Won't be a quick process because we
can't roll out something until we've built and tested it ourselves but I
will keep plugging along with the design work.

-Steve
