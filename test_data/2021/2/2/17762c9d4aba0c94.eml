VERY cool! Would be curious to hear what that was like. I'm pushing to get
an intro to Google's investment arm (or Alphabet) so hope to have some
countervailing insights...

Separately, I'm pushing your name as a potential interviewee for the
Accenture/NYTimes podcast I'm hosting. If that doesn't suit you please let
me know, and otherwise I'll keep you posted!

All best wishes,
Josh
