I have a call Wed. w/ the editor of this magazine for corporate =
directors. Below are his Q's if you have any feedback reg. Happy to talk =
this through in a brief call if you'd like to review beforehand!

Hi Josh,

We are looking to address new considerations for board oversight of =
human capital in light of the health and humanitarian crises of 2020.

We would especially appreciate your perspective on the role of =
technology and how it is changing this element of board oversight. =
Specifically, we hoped to at least cover the following points during our =
45-minute conversation:

Your thoughts on the ways in which the key human capital risks corporate =
leaders/directors should be aware of have changed since March 2020.


How corporate use of technology has changed in the past 12 months and =
how that technology might help or hinder how companies look at their =
workforce.

You can do this better than me =E2=80=93 zoom being the obvious one, =
other interesting angles =E2=80=93 1. We are starting to see more =
dynamic teams being formed because companies have become more virtual =
and a reduction in the role of the traditional line manager =E2=80=93 =
this increases effectiveness but blocks one (probably the biggest) of =
the main cultural dialogue pathways and 2. Tracking software is circling =
like a pack of hyenas =E2=80=93 companies seem tempted as they need =
something, even if they know that tracking software is not the right =
approach.=20

How companies are currently using data and what that might look like in =
the months/years ahead.

There isn=E2=80=99t much good and actionable data out there =E2=80=93 =
engagement software has run its course (how many more ways can you ask =
=E2=80=9Cwhat would make you happy?=E2=80=9D. MSGraph and others are =
starting to produce data that is interesting but not actionable. Changes =
to the use of data in human capital management are still some way in the =
future =E2=80=93 post COVID expect most companies to try to match their =
old ways of working and cultural messaging around a newly autonomous =
workforce =E2=80=93 at that point the need will become more apparent and =
we will start to see adoption of innovation

More specifics on Indigo Metrics: what does it do? How does it change =
workplace outcomes?
It=E2=80=99s a cultural messaging platform =E2=80=93 helping the =
individual and then helping the company

Explain The Google Analytics of Workplace Culture=E2=80=94what does =
Google have to do with this?

Is this first generation data collection and analysis to inform employee =
development because employees today expect more than a job, they expect =
their employer to help them improve?
Partly =E2=80=93 but also because the current parent to child =
relationship between firm and employee has raised unreasonable =
expectation from the employee. Particularly in a world of multiple =
careers in a lifetime. So we need to start by empowering the employee to =
help themselves to improve =E2=80=93 supported by their employer. We are =
going to be operating in an environment where the bond between employer =
and employee will not be like it was in the 1960s =E2=80=93 and we need =
cultural technology that reflects that reality.

How do you see a tool like this evolving? Are there other applications?

Multiple behavioural frames is the big expansion in the next few years =
=E2=80=93 particularly in relation to D&I but also innovation=20


Any thoughts on what the workplace of the future looks like vis a vis =
what we have learned from our year of lock down?=20

Autonomous employees is the big change driven forward by the pandemic =
that will be the story of the future. Our technology is B2B SaaS =
=E2=80=93 and will be for at least the next 5 years =E2=80=93 but over =
time I expect we will move to B2C SaaS, as autonomous employees manage =
their own soft skills, whilst dropping into various employers whose =
purpose aligns with theirs (as demonstrated by data) and who can use and =
help them develop their soft and hard skills. This will be a big change =
in =E2=80=9Cwhich employees will thrive=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 today it is =
around hard skills and managing your relationship with your line =
managers =E2=80=93 tomorrow will be around getting the basic hard =
skills, and from their managing your own journey focussing on evolving =
your soft skills and matching them with the home (employer) that is best =
for you. Employees that cannot self-manage in this way will not prosper. =
Employers that cannot interact with talent that is managing its =
development in this way will not prosper.
