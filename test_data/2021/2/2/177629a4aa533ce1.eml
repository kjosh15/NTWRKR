Chris,

I've been kicking around a revised pitch deck based on the feedback I'm
getting. Please take a look at the attached.

Notably, we need better images for slide 3, I need my assertions challenged
throughout, and I think we should update slide 9 based on your changes to
our spreadsheet. Now that we're getting a good response rate I want to try
the attached to see if we can sharpen the time to yes/no on followup
conversations.

Another five contacts out today, including some big players from the PayPal
mafia (Ken Howery) and a couple very good warm intros, such as to Spark
Capital.
