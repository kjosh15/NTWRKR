Just wanted to give a shout out - if you're looking for financial advice or
planning we've been working with Brio Financial in S.F. They are a super
friendly, LGBTQ-oriented financial firm who have gone out of their way to
accommodate us. Happy to make a connection if that'd be useful.

All best wishes,
Josh
