Absolutely.

The goal is primarily to provide practical tips for small business owners
and brands to produce experiential (event) marketing campaigns. The
undertone of my messaging is centered around mindfulness and making brand
experiences more authentic to build brand advocacy and loyalty vs just
awareness and popularity.

Long term I'd love to expand my tips for "memorable brand experiences" to
include brick & mortar stores as well as online-only businesses and
everything in between - essentially all aspects of audience-facing
experience design.
