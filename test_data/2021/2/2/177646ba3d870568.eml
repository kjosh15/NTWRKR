Hi Josh,

Wow, it's been a minute since we last spoke about crows when I was a writer
at The Stranger. It's such a nice surprise to hear from you. I checked out
the project links you sent, and thought they were all very neat. The
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing is especially cool to me.

I've since transitioned my career from writing to medical/scientific visual
communication (a common theme of storytelling, perhaps). Hence, my interest
in your medical innovations.

My main focus now is with an online med ed company, Osmosis.org (here's a
video on youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlYlHvu0aVc> that
explains some of what we do) and I'd be happy to make introductions if
you're interested in talking more with others in the company about
potentially collaborating with us somehow. We have a wide range of animated
videos for many aspects of medicine.

I also do occasional freelance comics, illustration, design, etc. usually
in the scientific sphere. There are exceptions to the scientific nature of
my work. For example, I just collaborated on a graphic narrative about
living through the pandemic through the lens of poetry for a class taught
to students at the University of Washington.

Let me know if you're still interested in talking and we can schedule
something. Again, great to hear from you.

All the best,
Kaia
