Matt,

I went back and confirmed that the brief I sent Jaron was the original
C-side, not the BBC one. That doesn't materially change the discussion I
don't think, but given what we're speaking to wanted to make sure you and I
had the same script. Let me know if you want to revisit ahead of our call.

All best,
Josh
