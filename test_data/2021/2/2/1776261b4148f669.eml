Ken,

Congrats on your recent move from your role in Sweden. I'm in Iceland at
the moment and would love to compare notes. The last few years I've been
focused on solving the problem of metricing and managing organizational
culture, and since BLM and Covid have been swimming in interesting data.
Would be curious to get your thoughts and just catch up generally!

Let me know if you're around and/or interested,
Josh
