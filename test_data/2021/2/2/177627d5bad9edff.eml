Sounds good. It=E2=80=99s worth noting that there are typically multiple =
EPs on documentary programs. Sometimes people offer money in exchange =
for an EP credit. Sometimes people are the =E2=80=9Cshow runners=E2=80=9D =
but receive the EP credit. Sometimes they are speakers in the doc who =
editorial input.

This is not a doc, so it=E2=80=99s a bit different. But I wouldn=E2=80=99t=
 worry too much about EP exclusivity. If you look at the list of EPs on =
docs using IMDB, you=E2=80=99ll see quite a few names. A doc I was =
researching recently had upwards of 15.

The role of the (production) studio or rather the production company as =
well as the role of another EP would simply be to ensure the green =
light=E2=80=94ie to ensure the investment from HBO. Nothing more. Some =
networks might like a treatment they receive but they demand you work in =
partnership with a production company they have trust in. Large =
production companies, EPs, they are simply icing on the cake to help =
sell the program.

Per Microsoft, yes. We should inquire about funding. We need some =
funding to jumpstart a larger treatment and to make a teaser. I am =
putting this money forward for another project and simply don=E2=80=99t =
have it to invest in anything else. So a Microsoft grant to put together =
the fuller treatment, design, and teaser would be incredible.

More soon,
Matt
