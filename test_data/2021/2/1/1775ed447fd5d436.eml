yes, it came to over $40 for that one sheet. I didn&#39;t upload the other =
parts to get the total &#39;new&#39; Ponoko price but I did notice that the=
 transparent acrylic is the cheapest. So all of those other sheets are goin=
g to cost more.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t know if the $15 =
