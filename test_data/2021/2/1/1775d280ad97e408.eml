Harris,

Thanks again for a terrific set of conversations over the last couple
weeks; I learned a ton and really appreciated your voice in the
proceedings. Having done a few of these in the past I say with confidence
you managed the crowd exceptionally well!

Let me know if you're game for a followup call to compare notes and see if
there's any overlap in our work pursuant to the topic discussed. Would be
very keen to continue the conversation!

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
