Sorry to keep you on the phone overlong.

Overall I think we're aligned on all points; read from the deck, offer
advisory and open the door to further involvement, then consider
what/who/how builds the larger deck.

Also understood on the value of bringing in another EP - and love the idea
of Edward Norton - although I'd want to make sure Jaron didn't have any ego
invested and was amiable to the idea first.

What I'd like to know more on is how bringing in a studio would benefit us.
As I understand it, we need to pitch the show to the channel/streamer (or
both, in the case of HBO) to get their investment to make the thing. Given
that, what's the role of the studio?

An alternative is to take some funding from a corporate - and Microsoft
seems like a good example. I think we should also check on this as part of
the convo w/ Jaron. That could ameliorate a lot of costs and make it much
easier for Jaron to justify more time involved.

Let me know what you think,
Josh
