Hi Josh,

We are looking to address new considerations for board oversight of human
capital in light of the health and humanitarian crises of 2020.

We would especially appreciate your perspective on the role of technology
and how it is changing this element of board oversight. Specifically, we
hoped to at least cover the following points during our 45-minute
conversation:

Your thoughts on the ways in which the key human capital risks corporate
leaders/directors should be aware of have changed since March 2020.


How corporate use of technology has changed in the past 12 months and how
that technology might help or hinder how companies look at their workforce.

How companies are currently using data and what that might look like in the
months/years ahead.

More specifics on Indigo Metrics: what does it do? How does it change
workplace outcomes?

Explain The Google Analytics of Workplace Culture=E2=80=94what does Google =
have to
do with this?

Is this first generation data collection and analysis to inform employee
development because employees today expect more than a job, they expect
their employer to help them improve?

How do you see a tool like this evolving? Are there other applications?

Any thoughts on what the workplace of the future looks like vis a vis what
we have learned from our year of lock down?
