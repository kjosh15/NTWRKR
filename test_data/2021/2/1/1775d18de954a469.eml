That was SO MUCH FUN. Thanks a million for the invitation!!

I know you're probably swimming in next steps with the information you
gathered, but wanted to get ahead of putting a time on the calendar to
discuss some of the opportunities this seems to have brought up. Let me
know if anything here <http://josh.is/scheduling> works or if there's a
good time GMT to reconnect in the next few weeks!

All best wishes,
Josh
