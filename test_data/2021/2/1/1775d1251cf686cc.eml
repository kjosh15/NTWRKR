Fran, thank you so much for the introduction! (To bcc to protect your
inbox.)

Hadrien, it's a pleasure to meet you. If you're amenable I'd like to have a
brief call in the next couple weeks to compare notes and see how/if we
could help each other. Let me know if any times here
<http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or if there's a better time for you GMT.

Gratefully,
Josh
