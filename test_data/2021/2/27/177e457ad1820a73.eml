After numerous conversations with founders, VCs, funds, angels, etc. we're
trying something new. Instead of giving away a big chunk of equity for
early-stage financing I'm going to pitch a few CTO's on creating a
consortium to use our platform to "solve" for DE&I.

The idea is that we provide our platform for up to 2k employees the first
year, and 5k the second, along with full ownership of the data, for $250k
up front each.


*TL;DR: Does a small cross-industry consortium solving for DE&I using our
data-led platform (for a fee) sound like a good alternative to early-stage
financing, and if so who do you think would be keen?*

All best wishes,
Josh
