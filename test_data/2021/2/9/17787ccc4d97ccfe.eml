So good connecting again; really excited about the book and the Future of
the US projects!! Really encouraging to see you doubling down on these
meaningful endeavors.

You'd kindly offered intros to touchdownvc.com and kitesrm.com. If that's
possible I'd be hugely grateful; they look like ideal folks to talk to.

Let me know what I can do to help - or even if you just need someone to
"talk to think" with!

All the best,
Josh
