As for the cat food amounts, let&#39;s update those. The last reported tota=
l as of 12/26 was $240.92. Since then we bought food on three dates in Janu=
ary (Byron did this so I don&#39;t know the exact dates) at the amounts of =
$63.82, $30.81 and $63.82 for a

I observed the last time that the food seems to come out to approximately $=
50 a week on average. So, if you&#39;re looking for a steady monthly amount=
, that would be $200. That seems to hold true for the just under $400 curre=

First let&#39;s start with the cat food. Since our last settling up, I have=
 spent the following: on 11/30 $35.20, 12/7 $53.91, 12/17 $40.00, 12/22 $50=
.20, 12/26 $61.61. That totals $240.92. You&#39;ll need to subtract what yo=
u paid for the lego Christmas gifts for
 the boys from me and the original $65 you sent before the big-settle up ba=
ck in November. Does that accounting make sense?</div>

Looking at trends, there seems to be an average of about $50 a week for the=
ir food. I hope that helps with budgeting. I try to buy the largest, most e=
conomical choices but sometimes they&#39;re out and sometimes I have other =
packages and can&#39;t carry as much. Would
 it help to just have a set monthly amount for your planning? If so, we can=
 just go on the average.</div>
