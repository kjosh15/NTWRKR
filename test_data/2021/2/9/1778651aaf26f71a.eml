We actually moved to Iceland; are you still covering corporate
investigations? Curious as much of my work these days is consulting to
senior execs + developing a SaaS platform to help companies see where their
leadership is missing the actual culture of the company (
www.indigometrics.com). We're getting huge interest in our platform for
D&I, so I'm now in a front row seat to so much bad internal organizational
misanthropy...!

Let me know if I can ever be of help - or if you come to Iceland!

All best,
Josh
