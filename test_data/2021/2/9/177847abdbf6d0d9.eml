Hey Josh,

Hope you and the family are doing well! Still living in Hayes Court?

Sakura and I are still in the apartment a block away, though that's about
the only place we are these days.

I've been volunteering some with the Jackson Heights Community Fridge. I am
still a reporter but now working for Reuters.

I don't think there's any overlap with what you do, but it was good to hear
from you. It's nice to maintain connections. Maybe one day we can roam
freely again and bump into each other on the street.

All the best,

Jody
