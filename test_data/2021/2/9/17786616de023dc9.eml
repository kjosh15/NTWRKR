<div dir=3D"ltr">Thanks, Devon! In terms of what=C2=A0was spent on Legos fo=
r XMas whatever you suggested was spent - shit is expensive over here! Once=
 you update us with a total of what we owe you we&#39;ll look into setting =
up a monthly payment schedule.=C2=A0
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In terms of timing, the boys get home around 3:45pm, we usually eat ar=
ound 5:30/6, and start the bedtime routine around 7:30/8pm. The guest room =
is downstairs, so as long as you&#39;re not keeping Othinn up (his bedroom =
is right next to it) I don&#39;t see any
 problems.=C2=A0</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I think I&#39;d rather avoid sharing our photos, sorry.=C2=A0</div>

<div>Can you send us your dates again?</div>

Okay, so I cannot give a full accounting without knowing what you paid for =
the legos gifted on my behalf for Christmas. I got the adorable thank you=
=C2=A0btw and it made my day! Once I know that amount, I&#39;m guessing abo=
ut the same would work for birthday gifts?</div>

As for the cat food amounts, let&#39;s update those. The last reported tota=
l as of 12/26 was $240.92. Since then we bought food on three dates in Janu=
ary (Byron did this so I don&#39;t know the exact dates) at the amounts of =
$63.82, $30.81 and $63.82 for a
<span style=3D"color:rgb(15,92,26)"><u><b>new total of $399.37</b></u></spa=
n>. I&#39;m due to go buy more later this week, just FYI.=C2=A0</div>

I observed the last time that the food seems to come out to approximately $=
50 a week on average. So, if you&#39;re looking for a steady monthly amount=
, that would be $200. That seems to hold true for the just under $400 curre=
nt bill that was for December and January.=C2=A0<span style=3D"color:rgb(0,=

 at the start of February, a new month, so maybe this is a good time to ins=

P.S. I checked and the earliest I can start work is 4pm your time, the late=
st would be 6pm your time. Please think about what would work best for you =
all. I&#39;m leaning towards the 4pm start, then my lunch break can be dinn=
er with you all and back to work. When
 do the boys get off of school? Ideally I&#39;d like to have some time with=
 them each day since that&#39;s part of why I&#39;m coming so far. Also, is=
 there a part of the house I can work in that is a bit separate/least likel=
y to disturb those who are sleeping?</div>

First let&#39;s start with the cat food. Since our last settling up, I have=
 spent the following: on 11/30 $35.20, 12/7 $53.91, 12/17 $40.00, 12/22 $50=
.20, 12/26 $61.61. That totals $240.92. You&#39;ll need to subtract what yo=
u paid for the lego Christmas gifts for
 the boys from me and the original $65 you sent before the big-settle up ba=
ck in November. Does that accounting make sense?</div>

Looking at trends, there seems to be an average of about $50 a week for the=
ir food. I hope that helps with budgeting. I try to buy the largest, most e=
conomical choices but sometimes they&#39;re out and sometimes I have other =
packages and can&#39;t carry as much. Would
 it help to just have a set monthly amount for your planning? If so, we can=
 just go on the average.</div>
