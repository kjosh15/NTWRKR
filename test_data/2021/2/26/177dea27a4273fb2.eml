Hulda,

The below talks about our kids - are you ok with this?

xoxo,

After numerous conversations with founders, VCs, funds, angels, etc. we're
trying something new. Instead of giving away a big chunk of equity for
early-stage financing I'm going to pitch a few CTO's on creating a
consortium to use our platform to "solve" for DE&I.

The idea is that we provide our platform for up to 2k employees the first
year, and 5k the second along with full ownership of the data for $250k up
front.


*TL;DR: Does a small cross-industry consortium solving for DE&I using our
data-led platform (for a fee) sound like a good alternative to early-stage
financing, and if so who do you think would be keen?*

SOMETHING DIFFERENT. Feedback I've received from a few of you is that you
really enjoy hearing about the ideas I'm noodling on or observing in
regards to technology. I thought I'd include a short summary below; if you
like it, let me know - this is stuff I can't stop chewing on and if it's
useful I'm happy to share!

A New Model for Globalist Education?

Recently my eldest son asked to move to a different school because the
curriculum in his current school was too easy. He wants to go to a "normal"
(non-virtual) school because he wants the socialization, but his math and
science skills are beyond his grade whereas his spelling and writing in
Icelandic is below or average (due to him learning a new language this
year).

In the beginning of the pandemic he was fully virtual, and has used a
variety of gamified platforms (like Prodigy or Epic) as well as Khan
Academy. When I asked how he'd like to learn best, he was very clear that
he liked learning math online, wanted to do more reading in a gamified
environment, and was curious if I could find any other software platforms
for spelling.

Oh, and he still wanted to go to "real" school.

The "flipped" classroom has produced extremely rich environments which are
data-driven for *material* delivery. Want to learn algebra? The best video
instruction in the world (statistically measured and qualified for the
viewer) are readily available. Need to improve your spelling? Google lists
literally thousands of games for 2nd grade alone.

But, weirdly, our schools are still focused on material delivery. So now
instead of the - literally - highest ranked instructors in the world, my
kids are learning from whoever happens to be on payroll in my neighborhood
this year.

*None of that is new or (really) interesting.* Instead, the realization
here was that what schools can and should provide is socialization, and in
a world in which much of work has been decoupled from geography, even more
so cross-culturation.

How about this as a model? You and your family land in a new country, and
your kid signs up at the local school. When he arrives he figures out which
kids are working on similar material at a similar level, and they all work
to help each other. Teachers provide social support, emphasize shared
values and collaboration, and teach to the local culture (local songs,
holidays, customs, history, foods, etc.). When you and/or your kids go
somewhere else, they enroll the same way.

In other words, make the material incidental - and the traditions and
cultural practices specific - to the location.

As we look forward to a post-pandemic (is that even a thing??) world, it's
clear that virutalization isn't going to *decrease*. Global mobility ought
to increase, especially among white-collar workers. And yet our children
are still subject to models of education built around an agrarian
revolution.

There's got to be a better way that doesn't just toss everything on the
parent's lap as "home schooling," especially when the last century of
globalization has shown the benefits of cross-cultural interaction.

Thoughts?
