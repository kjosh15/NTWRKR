Any thoughts on this? Trying to figure out what my best argument for an EP
title is.

Also, does the waterfall described here make sense? Was thinking I could
argue that my time should be reimbursed as well (he actually paid cash for
a bunch of material, so this may be escalating badly).

Any thoughts?

Thanks!!

Hi Josh!

Thanks for your quick response,

BBC is a network. Jaron is a possible advisor and EP.

However, a new treatment isn=E2=80=99t being developed, just updating old o=
ne-sheet
GrrCo made that was sent to Jaron in error.

We=E2=80=99d be happy to hear out the reasoning for an EP title, which are
typically given to show runners and financial backers.
What are the terms? If Matt is the show runner (EP) as head of creative,
what do you want out of an EP title?

50% of creator pool revenue goes to GrrCo for paying back upfront costs
until paid. We haven=E2=80=99t calculated it out with this latest batch of =
days,
but it=E2=80=99s somewhere around $20k.

Best,
Mar

Thanks, Mar!

Reg. the title, I appreciate that a deck which was rejected by the BBC had
me listed as producer/special advisor. We're developing a treatment now for
use w/ Jaron Lanier, who I brought in, and hope to add funders I'm also
anticipating connecting us to. In light of that I'd like to have an EP
title.

One other question; what's the waterfall payment / recoupment schedule?

Many thanks,
Josh
