Harris,

Thanks for the call on Wednesday; it was good to hear more about your take
on the state of global business and the (potentially missed) impact of tech=
!

As requested I'm attaching the overview deck for Indigometrics (my culture
metrics SaaS company), but encourage you to check out our sandbox as well
to get a better handle on the data it generates:

http://reviews.indigometrics.com/
USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$


We're looking to work with large multinationals who are eager to put data
to their culture. If you know anyone that might be a good fit I'd very much
appreciate the connection.

Along those same lines, you'd recommended we talk to Towers Paren (now
Willis Towers Watson): I really like the idea partnering with larger
HR+Data companies that may have a greater need for a technical advantage,
but don't understand how to qualify multi-service platform organizations
like this. Insurance (where Willis Towers Watson seems to sit now) is too
broad, and players I've spoken to (like Marsh) are miles away from
understanding the value.

It may be I'm missing the forest for the trees here. Do you have a view on
how best to attack this?

All best,
Josh
