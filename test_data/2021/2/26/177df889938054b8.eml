Just had an excellent conversation with Mahesh, CTO Motorola. Short version
is our timing is excellent - their new head of D&I, Tanisha Agramonte, has
only been there for 4 months and is still in her honeymoon period. More
importantly, she's realizing she has a big data gap she needs to fill to
address their D&I issues.

Her approach is that they don't know how to solve this, but they know what
sort of outcomes they want and she is currently exploring partnerships
(academic, etc.) to help solve it.

Mahesh is going to introduce us and thinks the consortium idea makes really
good sense, especially inasmuch as it lets similarly sized companies
compare notes and share solutions while protecting data.

Perhaps more important is that Mahesh immediately got the consortium idea,
didn't even flinch at the price tag, and almost interrupted me to suggest
next steps. He was very clear that large companies are desperately in need
of a good answer to addressing this problem right now and that this
approach ticked a lot of boxes he saw as necessary in crafting a solution.

If you're comfortable with it I'll reach out to a couple other CTO's I'm
friendly with (Estee Lauder, BP, and Sherwin Williams) to get a time on the
calendar for similar pitches.

Gonna have to get a better bottle of tequila...
- J
