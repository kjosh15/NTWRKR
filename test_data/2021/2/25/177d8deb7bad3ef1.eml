This is brilliant; they offered me 40% (which I'll take), and pushed back
on the EP title (which I'll argue), and didn't mention the waterfall
structure for recoupment. I'll ask them reg. that now.

Otherwise, as R said, it's early days - all this is preliminary to actually
making something. Was so good talking to you yesterday! Will ping you again
as/if I learn more. Thanks again for the help here!!!

In the meantime, what sort of quote are you looking for about your
abilities as a consultant? Did you want to write two or three examples and
I can tweak one to my own words?

All best,
Josh
