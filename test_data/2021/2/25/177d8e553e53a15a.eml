Thanks, Mar!

Reg. the title, I appreciate that a deck which was rejected by the BBC had
me listed as producer/special advisor. We're developing a treatment now for
use w/ Jaron Lanier, who I brought in, and hope to add funders I'm also
anticipating connecting us to. In light of that I'd like to have an EP
title.

One other question; what's the waterfall payment / recoupment schedule?

Many thanks,
Josh
