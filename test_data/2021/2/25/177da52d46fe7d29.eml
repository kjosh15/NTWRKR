Hey, long time no speak! I'm currently co-hosting a big new podcast for
Accenture and wanted to catch up and hear more about what you're doing at
Gimlet. Podcasting is... well, it's fun as hell, and given that my
day-to-day still consists of a lot of consulting directly to senior
executives across the Fortune 500 it seemed wise to connect and talk about
possibilities.

Let me know if you have a moment for a quick call in the next couple weeks!

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
