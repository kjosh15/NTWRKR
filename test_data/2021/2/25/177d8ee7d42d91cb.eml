I was just thinking that what you said yesterday was really lovely; some thi=

n or something like that. It just has to be real, don=E2=80=99t worry about i=

ou and Rupert are doing well, wherever you are - is that still the UK, or di=
d you head back to the US? We're now fully ensconced in Iceland and the last=
 of our stuff from NYC arrives by boat early next month. So we're now offici=
ally refugees, albeit with some pretty glamorous conditions for a pandemic..=
. :)<br><br>That aside, I had a business question. I've gotten Jaren Lanier a=
t Microsoft interested in doing an AI-led tv series I co-developed with a do=
cumentary filmmaker friend. My friend's company (XYZ Studios, here) wants to=
 draw up a basic agreement before we move forward any further; do you have a=
ny feedback on these terms? I don't have a clue what to look for!!!<br><br><=
ul><li>I wanted to check with you a few contractual points, which are as fol=
lows: </li><li>XYZ Studios LLC and Josh Klein=E2=80=99s LLC work together to=
 create an AI-themed series.</li><li>XYZ will lead editorial and creative de=
cisions.</li><li>Josh will lead the technological efforts.</li><li>The two L=
LC=E2=80=99s will work together on business development, planning and produc=
tion.</li><li>The pool breakdown of financial returns and ownership on the p=
roject will be 40/60 with Josh=E2=80=99s LLC and XYZ claiming the 60%. Of th=
at 60%, XYZ will hold 65%, as XYZ is bearing the brunt of show development, t=
ime, and costs.</li><li>As reflected in the previous documents, Matt will ho=
ld an EP and directing credit on the project. Josh will hold a producer and l=
ead technologist credit.</li><li>The last open or first end credit will read=
 =E2=80=9CCreated by Matt Danzico / Josh Klein=E2=80=9D</li><li>Development e=
xpenses, outside those already put in by XYZ, will be put forward by investo=
rs, a network, or other outside parties.</li><li>Investors have the opportun=
ity to come in as additional EPs.</li></ul><br>Any thoughts/suggestions are a=
ppreciated. Let me know what you all are up to and of course if I can ever r=
eturn the favor!<br><br>Gratefully,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-p=
