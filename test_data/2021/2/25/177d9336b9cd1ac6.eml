Matt,

Was about to send this to you when I realized you may not be passing .pdf's
via email for security reasons. If that's so, let me know how to get the
file to you - I don't want to compromise anything! Otherwise I'll email you
the latest .pdf.

---

Let me know what you think; the only thing I struggled with was that I
couldn't edit the text - my only two comments here were about the EULA,
which is a discussion for post-pitch anyway, and examples for act IV, which
again isn't enormously material.

Otherwise I made a few minor changes as suggested - let me know if it looks
ok and I'll pass it to Jaron along with a request for a followup call!

All best,
Josh
