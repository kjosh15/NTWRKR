                               OK. FWIW I'm pretty handy with GIMP (Photosh=

                                <br>In terms of the chat, do we want to all=

 or force them to discuss whatever GPT-3 chooses?
                                <br>
                                <br>I think we should have a EULA up front =
allowing us to use the content of the conversation, vs. asking after 20 exc=
hanges. (This provides more blanket legal protection and "breaks the illusi=
on" less.)
                                <br>
                                <br>ACT II: can we emphasize that this isn'=
t reading a text screen? I.e., using actors reading the script, or animatio=
ns, or something more visual. Maybe just make the text bar in this image sm=
aller?
                                <br>
                                <br>ACT II: Can we use a picture of a Bosto=
n Dynamics robot here to emphasize how real world this is? Would love to ac=
tually have a robot walk autonomously into people's homes before having a c=
onversation? OMG, so intrusive and awkward...! If nothing else this might b=
e a better visual to impress upon the reader how weird this would be.
                                <br>
                                <br>ACT IV: Think we should provide some ex=
amples here. I.e., political analyst on cults, or vaccine specialist, or pr=
otest movement leaders. Again, is it worth getting GPT-3 involved here to p=
ush the weirdness up a notch?

re of work ahead of me. Happy to be the one putting in the time up front, b=
ut I first have to figure out how that is then balanced out between us cont=
ractually. I have a meeting today with my producer. So I=E2=80=99ll start o=
n the contract bits with her and let her take that over for me. I=E2=80=99l=
l have her reach out.
