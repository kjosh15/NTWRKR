Just got off the phone with Chris and wanted to sum the main points while
they're fresh:

1. We need to be cash-flow positive enough to pay me a salary, or
2. We need to raise funds (so we have the cash) to pay me a salary, or
3. I can take some of the equity I'm earning as cash (and be diluted).

Chris' point was that it's event driven. I.e., we need another ~10k users
(at which point we're cash-flow positive enough to pay a salary) or
investment so we have enough cash to pay it out.

His overall view is that we need to just keep plugging away; very soon
we'll have enough revenue for salaries, then we'll have $1mm ARR, and then
we'll have folks knocking at our door wanting to invest/buy.

xoxo,
Josh
