Hey Josh.

It=E2=80=99s nice to hear from you, although it=E2=80=99s hard to tell =
whether this is a personalized or bulk mailing.

I=E2=80=99m in the middle of parental leave from my position at Apple, =
so I=E2=80=99m not looking to start anything new at the moment.

I=E2=80=99m glad to see that you=E2=80=99re keeping busy too!

Best, Nicholas.
