Hi!
Congrats on the vaccination and good idea for the self care.=20
I had in my head that Wednesday was our day but when I didn=E2=80=99t =
hear from you I knew you are at full capacity. A 'week off' still means =
a long to do list. :)
 I trust our process and timing 100%  so it wasn=E2=80=99t any stress.=20=

June is full for me with both 2 full weekends of school and many more =
student group commitments and packing for our move on July 7th. Both =
getting things ready to move and packing for a 2 month road trip. Sans =
children of course and in a country I=E2=80=99m familiar with but its =
got many additional things coming with it like having to negotiate with =
my sister about the apartment and the opportunity to revisit family =
triggers=E2=80=A6 hahaha=E2=80=A6the other kind of baggage and =
unpacking.

And, I want to stay in touch. I miss hearing the updates while =
completely understand the differing energies/routines/commitments/full =
schedule living.=20

School is amazing. Im really on the right path and have been grateful to =
have you on the journey this last year.=20

June 28th to July 4th is very flexible. I think get something the books =
and then see how it unfolds?=20
Love, B
