Brace yourself; I'm coming to NYC! I'll be there from July 15-22nd if
you're around - let me know if you've got time for a meal or a drink,
and/or if you have a couch that needs a large-ish man to sleep on it in
that window. Looking forward to seeing you in Real Life again after a heck
of a year!!

All best,
Josh
