Marc has been a sort of hero of mine ever since I was a teenager, when Nets=
cape Navigator felt like it opened up the world. I came out to California i=
n part to meet people like him. Now we know each other well, and he=E2=80=
=99s a subscriber to my blog! The thing I always like about talking to Marc=
 is how he combines relentless optimism with the concrete knowledge to back=
 up that optimism =E2=80=94 both knowledge of specific details and a broad =
understanding of various schools of thought. Lots of people will tell you t=
he future holds amazing possibilities; Marc will tell you exactly what thos=
e possibilities are, and why they=E2=80=99re possible.=20
In the interview that follows, I ask Marc ten questions about technology an=
d the future =E2=80=94 about automation, U.S. institutions, social media, c=
ompetition from China, crypto, the future of the VC industry, and more.=20
N.S.: So, back in April of 2020 you wrote a very widely read essay called "=
It's Time to Build [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkE1uxCAMhU8z7Cbid0=

 basically arguing that the pandemic had exposed deep dysfunction in many o=
f America's institutions and industries, and that we need to build new thin=
gs to get ourselves out of this rut. I pretty strongly agree with that. My =
question is: What do you think are some of the top priorities for things we=
 need to build, in both the private and public sectors? And who ought to be=
 building them?
M.A.: The 15 months since I wrote It=E2=80=99s Time To Build have been domi=
nated by three big events: the catastrophe of COVID, the systematic failure=
 of virtually all public sector entities around the world (the formerly hig=
h functioning Asian nations are failing to vaccinate quickly), and the rema=
rkable success of the private sector and in particular the American technol=
ogy industry in helping us all get through this pandemic in far better coll=
ective shape that we had any right to expect. (See my new essay Technology =
Saves The World [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEtuhDAQRE8z3g0y_mBYe=

So the good news is that, notwithstanding the apparent chronic collapse of =
state capacity virtually everywhere in our time, the private sector can and=
 does deliver even under considerable duress, and even when much of our pol=
itical system is devoted to stifling it with regulatory handcuffs and damag=
ing it with misguided policies.
Now, God knows there is still a lot to build. For starters, most of our cou=
ntry, as well as most of the world, does not yet have the remarkably advanc=
ed standard of living that the elite readers of this interview have come to=
 expect. Consider the three primary markers of the American Dream, or more =
generally middle class success -- housing, education, and health care. You =
have written at length on how all three of these success markers seem furth=
er and further out of reach for many regular people. I think -- and you wou=
ld agree? -- that these three deficits are not only causing problems for ho=
w people live and how the economy functions, but are fouling our politics q=
uite dramatically.
Housing, education, and health care are each ferociously complex, but what =
they have in common is skyrocketing prices in a world where technology is d=
riving down prices of most other products and services. (See chart below.) =
I think we should build in the next decade new technologies, businesses, an=
d industries that break these price curves -- and in fact reverse them, and=
 make these three primary markers of the American dream easier and easier f=
or regular people to attain. I=E2=80=99m proud that my venture firm has exc=
iting startup investments in all three sectors, but we have a lot more work=
 to do. I hope more people join us in this mission.
N.S.: One of the themes of my blog so far has been techno-optimism. I have =
to say that some of that attitude comes from talking to you over the years!=
 Are you still optimistic about the near future of tech? And if so, which t=
ech should we be most excited about?=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0
M.A.: I am very optimistic about the future of tech, at least in the domain=
s where software-driven innovation is allowed. It=E2=80=99s been a decade s=
ince I wrote my essay Software Eats The World, and the case I made in that =
essay is even more true today. Software continues to eat the world, and wil=
l for decades to come, and that=E2=80=99s a wonderful thing. Let me explain=
 why.
First, a common criticism of software is that it=E2=80=99s not something th=
at takes physical form in the real world. For example, software is not a ho=
use, or a school, or a hospital. This is of course true on the surface, but=
 it misses a key point.
Software is a lever on the real world.
Someone writes code, and all of a sudden riders and drivers coordinate a co=
mpletely new kind of real-world transportation system, and we call it Lyft.=
 Someone writes code, and all of a sudden homeowners and guests coordinate =
a completely new kind of real-world real estate system, and we call it AirB=
NB. Someone writes code, etc., and we have cars that drive themselves, and =
planes that fly themselves, and wristwatches that tell us if we=E2=80=99re =
healthy or ill.
Software is our modern alchemy. Isaac Newton spent much of his life trying =
and failing to transmute a base element -- lead -- into a valuable material=
 -- gold. Software is alchemy that turns bytes into actions by and on atoms=
=2E It=E2=80=99s the closest thing we have to magic.
So instead of feeling like we are failing if we=E2=80=99re not building in =
atoms, we should lean as hard into software as we possibly can. Everywhere =
software touches the real world, the real world gets better, and less expen=
sive, and more efficient, and more adaptable, and better for people. And th=
is is especially true for the real world domains that have been least touch=
ed by software until now -- such as housing, education, and health care.
N.S.: Recently you've invested in at least two companies, Clubhouse and Sub=
stack, that are part of a new wave of social media. Discord might also be i=
ncluded in that wave. Why now? What was lacking in the "old social media" o=
f Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube? How might the new networks impr=
ove on that?
M.A.: It=E2=80=99s not so much what is lacking in the incumbents. It=E2=80=
=99s more the importance of communication as the foundation of everything t=
hat people do, and how we open up new ways for people to communicate, colla=
borate, and coordinate. Like software, communication technology is somethin=
g that people tend to pooh-pooh, or even scorn -- but, when you compare wha=
t any one of us can do alone, to what we can do when we are part of a group=
 or a community or a company or a nation, there=E2=80=99s no question that =
communication forms the backbone of virtually all progress in the world. An=
d so improving our ability to communicate is fundamental.
Clubhouse is the Athenian agora come to life, globally. I mean that serious=
ly. Clubhouse is the first venue for people anywhere in the world to come t=
ogether in groups to talk -- not metaphorically, but literally -- about any=
 topic they can imagine. It=E2=80=99s so striking that in our primarily tex=
tual technological world, people are instantly enthusiastic about the oppor=
tunity to participate in oral culture online -- there is something timeless=
 about talking in groups, whether it=E2=80=99s around a campfire 5,000 year=
s ago or on an app today.
Substack is the business model for intellectual creativity that=E2=80=99s b=
een missing on the Internet for 30 years. I=E2=80=99m so excited about this=
=2E Substack isn=E2=80=99t a new form of=
 communication; in fact it=E2=80=99s =
the original form of Internet communication -- the written essay, the IETF =
Request for Comments, the newsgroup posting, the group email, the blog post=
=2E But until now you could never get pa=
id for writing online, and now all of=
 a sudden you can. I think it=E2=80=99s hard to imagine how transformationa=
l this is going to be.
Substack is causing enormous amounts of new quality writing to come into ex=

N.S.: Your most famous quote is probably "Software is eating the world". Ho=

competed by companies that start out as software companies and then branch =
into traditional markets, as my friend Roy Bahat believes [https://email.mg=

 else?
M.A.: My =E2=80=9Csoftware eats the world=E2=80=9D thesis plays out in busi=
ness in three stages:
A product is transformed from non-software to (entirely or mainly) software=
=2E Music compact discs become MP3=E2=80=
=99s and then streams. An alarm clock=
 goes from a physical device on your bedside table to an app on your phone.=
 A car goes from bent metal and glass, to software wrapped in bent metal an=
d glass.
The producers of these products are transformed from manufacturing or media=
 or financial services companies to (entirely or mainly) software companies=
=2E Their core capability becomes creati=
ng and running software. This is, of =
course, a very different discipline and culture from what they used to do.
As software redefines the product, and assuming a competitive market not pr=
otected by a monopoly position or regulatory capture, the nature of competi=
tion in the industry changes until the best software wins, which means the =
best software company wins. The best software company may be an incumbent o=
r a startup, whoever makes the best software.
My partner Alex Rampell says that competition between an incumbent and a so=
ftware-driven startup is =E2=80=9Ca race, where the startup is trying to ge=
t distribution before the incumbent gets innovation=E2=80=9D. The incumbent=
 starts with a giant advantage, which is the existing customer base, the ex=
isting brand. But the software startup also starts with a giant advantage, =
which is a culture built to create software from the start, with no need to=
 adapt an older culture designed to bend metal, shuffle paper, or answer ph=
ones.
As time passes, I am increasingly skeptical that most incumbents can adapt.=
 The culture shift is just too hard. Great software people tend to not want=
 to work at an incumbent where the culture is not optimized to them, where =
they are not in charge. It is proving easier in many cases to just start a =
new company than try to retrofit an incumbent. I used to think time would a=
meliorate this, as the world adapts to software, but the pattern seems to b=
e intensifying. A good test for how seriously an incumbent is taking softwa=
re is the percent of the top 100 executives and managers with computer scie=
nce degrees. For a typical tech startup, the answer might be 50-70%. For a =
typical incumbent, the answer may be more like 5-7%. This is a huge gap in =
software knowledge and skill, and you see it play out every day across many=
 industries.
As for Artificial Intelligence, as an engineer myself, it=E2=80=99s hard to=
 be quite as romantic as a lot of observers tend to be. AI -- or, to use th=
e more prosaic term, Machine Learning -- is an incredibly powerful technolo=
gy, and the last decade has seen explosive AI/ML innovation that=E2=80=99s =
increasingly showing up in the real world. But it=E2=80=99s still just soft=
ware, math, numbers; the machines aren=E2=80=99t becoming self aware, Skyne=
t is not here, computers still do exactly what we tell them. So AI/ML conti=
nues to be a tool used by people, more than a replacement for people.
A famous story from the birth of computer science has Alan Turing, father o=
f the computer, lunching with Claude Shannon, father of information theory,=
 in the AT&T executive dining room near Bell Labs in the early 1940s. Turin=
g and Shannon engage in an increasingly heated discussion about the future =
of thinking machines when Turing stands up, pushes his chair back, and says=
 loudly, =E2=80=9CNo, I=E2=80=99m not interested in developing a powerful b=
rain! All I=E2=80=99m after is a mediocre brain, something like the Preside=
nt of AT&T.'"
I think about AI like that -- although, for the record, the President of AT=
&T is a friend of mine, and he=E2=80=99s actually quite bright. I suspect =
=E2=80=9CArtificial Intelligence=E2=80=9D is the wrong framing for the tech=
nology; Doug Engelbart was probably more correct with what he called =E2=80=
=9CAugmentation=E2=80=9D, so think =E2=80=9CAugmented Intelligence=E2=80=9D=
=2E Augmented Intelligence makes machine=
s better thought partners for people.=
 This concept is clearer for considering both the technological and economi=
c consequences. What we should see in a world of rapidly proliferating Augm=
ented Intelligence is the opposite of a jobless dystopia -- productivity gr=
owth, economic growth, new job growth, and wage growth.
And I think this is exactly what we are seeing. It=E2=80=99s worth remember=
ing that before COVID, only 18 months ago, we were experiencing the best ec=
onomy in 70 years -- rising wages, low and falling unemployment, and essent=
ially zero inflation. The economy was even improving more for lower skill a=
nd lower income people than it was for people like us, despite computers ev=
erywhere. Unemployment among the most disadvantaged in our society -- peopl=
e without even high school degrees -- was as low as it=E2=80=99s ever been.=
 This is far from an automation-driven dystopia; in fact, it=E2=80=99s the =
payoff from three centuries of increasing mechanization and computerization=
=2E As the economy recovers from COVID,=20=
I expect these positive trends to con=
tinue.
N.S.: Speaking of software eating the world, I've been writing [https://ema=

-5ng5r1XApJB0XVMN0cLnDDKNTQD6Q5-tSmov77_Qd-vJPt] that the true productive p=
otential of the internet is only getting started, and that the pandemic wil=
l end up having pushed us to develop more distributed systems of production=
 -- much like when electricity allowed factories to switch from a single dr=
ive train to multiple independently powered workstations a century ago. Do =
you think that's basically right? Do you see more work going remote, and/or=
 business operations becoming more fragmented between different companies?=
=C2=A0
M.A.: I think that=E2=80=99s right.=C2=A0
First, COVID is the ultimate cover for restructuring -- what my friend and =
former CFO Peter Currie used to call =E2=80=9Cshake and bake=E2=80=9D. It=
=E2=80=99s an opportunity for every CEO to do all the things he/she may hav=
e wanted to do in the past to increase efficiency and effectiveness -- from=
 fundamental headcount resizing and reorganization, to changing geographic =
footprint, to exiting stale lines of business -- but couldn=E2=80=99t becau=
se they would cause too much disruption. The disruption is happening anyway=
, so you might as well do everything you=E2=80=99ve always wanted to do now.
Second, it=E2=80=99s hard to overstate the positive shock that remote work =
works. Remote work isn=E2=80=99t perfect, there are problems, but virtually=
 every CEO I=E2=80=99ve talked to over the last year marvels at how well it=
 works. And remote work worked under the extreme duress of a pandemic, with=
 all of the human impact of lockdowns and children unable to go to school a=
nd people being unable to see their friends and extended families. It will =
work even better out of COVID. Companies of all shapes, sizes, and descript=
ions are retooling their assumptions on geographic footprint, where jobs ar=
e located, where employees are located, how offices are configured, and if =
there should be offices at all.
Combining these factors, it=E2=80=99s possible that we=E2=80=99ll see a hug=
e surge in productivity growth over the next 5 years. This productivity gro=
wth is, in my view, the key to a strong =E2=80=9Croaring 20=E2=80=99s=E2=80=
=9D thesis, that we are going to see an amazing economic boom in the US ove=
r the next several years, even on top of the incredible boom of 2009-2020. =
I don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s a certainty, but I think it=E2=80=99s =
possible -- even likely.
Third, this isn=E2=80=99t just a dramatic change in how companies operate, =
it=E2=80=99s also an equally dramatic change in how individuals live and wo=
rk. For anyone who does his/her job mainly with other people and/or through=
 a screen -- an increasing percent of the workforce every year, and most pe=
ople with college degrees -- this is an opportunity to rethink everything f=
rom what career to pursue, to what employer to work for, to where to live, =
to how to live. We are already seeing a huge surge in job turnover at big t=
ech companies, driven by the employees as much as the employers, and I expe=
ct this to continue as people reconfigure their lives for the new choices o=
f the post-COVID world. The biggest change is the uncoupling of where you l=
ive from where you work, but even beyond that, I think a lot of people may =
choose to live very different lives coming out of this -- forming new kinds=
 of intentional communities, for example.
And then there=E2=80=99s the fact that most employers in the past couldn=E2=
=80=99t hire most potential workers due to geographic constraints, but now =
they can -- talent may not actually be distributed equally, but it=E2=80=99=
s certainly distributed far more than companies and workers have been able =
to take advantage of -- and all of a sudden, the opportunity to far more ef=
fectively match employer and worker all over the world exists.
Add this all up, and you have a potentially massive unlock of latent econom=
ic growth potential in the US and around the world. Many more people fitted=
 into better jobs, more spending power creating more demand, more new indus=
try and business creation, more job growth and wage growth=E2=80=A6I don=E2=
=80=99t want to predict only blue skies ahead, but the positive scenarios a=
re probably underrated.
N.S.: You've been more and more interested in the crypto space in recent ye=
ars. What are some cool things about crypto that aren't emphasized enough i=
n popular discussions?
M.A.: Crypto is one of those topics that calls to mind the parable of the b=
lind men and the elephant -- there are so many aspects of how it works and =
what it means that you can interpret it many different ways and seize on on=
e part or another to make whatever point you want. A lot of people, for exa=
mple, seize on the money part, and either glorify it as a new kind of monet=
ary system that liberates mankind from the nation state, or crucify it as a=
 danger to economic stability and the ability for governments to tax. All o=
f these are interesting arguments, but I think they all miss a more fundame=
ntal point, which is that crypto represents an architectural shift in how t=
echnology works and therefore how the world works.
That architectural shift is called distributed consensus -- the ability for=
 many untrusted participants in a network to establish consistency and trus=
t. This is something the Internet has never had, but now it does, and I thi=
nk it will take 30 years to work through all of the things we can do as a r=
esult. Money is the easiest application of this idea, but think more broadl=
y -- we can now, in theory, build Internet native contracts, loans, insuran=
ce, title to real world assets, unique digital goods (known as non-fungible=
 tokens or NFTs), online corporate structures (such as digital autonomous o=
rganizations or DAOs), and on and on.
Consider also what this means for incentives. Up until now, collaborative h=
uman effort online either took the form of a literal adoption of real-world=
 corporate norms -- a company with a web site -- or an open source project =
like Linux that had no money directly attached. With crypto, you can now cr=
eate thousands of new kinds of incentive systems for collaborative work onl=
ine, since participants in a crypto project can get paid directly without a=
 real-world company even needing to exist. As great as open source software=
 development has been, far more people are willing to do far more things fo=
r money than for free, and all of a sudden all those things become possible=
 and even easy to do. Again, it will take 30 years to work through the cons=
equences of this, but I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s crazy that this co=
uld be a civilizational shift in how people work and get paid.
Finally, Peter Thiel has made the characteristically sweeping observation t=
hat AI is in some sense a left wing idea -- centralized machines making top=
-down decisions -- but crypto is a right wing idea -- many distributed agen=
ts, humans and bots, making bottom-up decisions. I think there=E2=80=99s so=
mething to that. Historically the tech industry has been dominated by left =
wing politics, just like any creative field, which is why you see today=E2=
=80=99s big tech companies so intertwined with the Democratic Party. Crypto=
 potentially represents the creation of a whole new category of technology,=
 quite literally right wing tech that is far more aggressively decentralize=
d and far more comfortable with entrepreneurialism and free voluntary excha=
nge. If you believe, as I do, that the world needs far more technology, thi=
s is a very powerful idea, a step function increase in what the technology =
world can do.
N.S.: A16Z has become famous for innovating in the space of venture capital=
 itself, offering more extensive services to portfolio companies and becomi=
ng a registered investment advisor. What are some other changes you see VC =
firms exploring in the years to come? Might some come to resemble private e=
quity firms, or banks? Are there any totally new business models on the hor=
izon?
M.A.: There=E2=80=99s something very old about what venture capital is -- T=
yler Cowen uses the term =E2=80=9Cproject evaluation=E2=80=9D, the process =
of sorting through many possible configurations of people and ideas and the=
n picking a few to back with money and effort to try to create something ne=
w and important in the world. In venture capital, this idea traces back to =
the whaling industry of centuries past, where independent financiers would =
fund captains and ships to hunt whales -- legend has it this is the origin =
of the term =E2=80=9Ccarried interest=E2=80=9D, which originally meant the =
share of the whale carried by the ship and kept by the captain and crew. Th=
e same =E2=80=9Cproject evaluation=E2=80=9D pattern has played out repeated=
ly for centuries, for many kinds of large-scale, risky projects, from colon=
ial settlements like the Plymouth colony, to music/film/television projects=
, to the world=E2=80=99s largest private equity transactions.
But of course there=E2=80=99s also something very new about what venture ca=
pital is -- we fund the most cutting edge ideas and projects in the world, =
brand new conceptions of what technology makes possible. The founders we fu=
nd routinely break rules and create new models that people think are imposs=
ible until they happen. This includes many of the leading edge crypto ideas=
 I discussed above, many of which assume a very different form of industria=
l organization than a classic joint stock company.
So we sit at the vortex of this combination of the very old and the very ne=
w. It=E2=80=99s certainly possible that venture capital itself gets pulled =
into this vortex and comes out the other side radically transformed, and in=
 fact this is what some of the smartest crypto experts are predicting. And =
yet=E2=80=A6there is, at least so far, no substitute to someone doing the w=
ork of sorting and filtering all of the potential projects and making big a=
nd risky bets. Is this Robert Michels=E2=80=99 Iron Law of Oligarchy for se=
lecting, organizing, and funding risky ventures, regardless of what kind of=
 technology is involved? I=E2=80=99m not sure, but maybe.
Closer to home, an increasing focus of mine is whether we can break what I =
call the =E2=80=9Clittle boy/big boy=E2=80=9D pattern of how technology pro=
jects are funded and scaled. The =E2=80=9Clittle boy=E2=80=9D is the Silico=
n Valley ecosystem that gets new ventures off the ground; the =E2=80=9Cbig =
boy=E2=80=9D is New York and the Wall Street world of stock markets and inv=
estment banks and hedge funds that tends to carry companies to scale during=
 and after IPO. Maybe it=E2=80=99s time for Silicon Valley -- as a geograph=
ic location, as a network of people, as a state of mind -- to take on a big=
ger role in the economy, scaling our companies all the way to huge without =
ever handing them off to professionals on the other literal and metaphorica=
l coast who may not understand and value them the way we do. We=E2=80=99ll =
see...
N.S.: I still remember reading an article about you in 1996, on Netscape Na=
vigator on my dad's PC. You had hair! Anyway, you kind of became an icon of=
 the 90s, which were a very formative time for both me and for the internet=
=2E So I wanted to ask: In what ways did=
 the dreams of the 1990s techies come=
 true? And in what ways were they dashed on the rocks of reality? When we t=
hink back on the 90s, how should we remember that era, and what ideas from =
that era should we hold on to?
M.A.: It worked! The dreams came true; it all worked. And now we=E2=80=99re=
 the dog that caught the bus. What do we do with this damned bus?
Think about what we=E2=80=99ve done. Five billion people are now carrying n=
etworked supercomputers in their pockets. Anyone in the world can create a =
web site and publish anything they want, can communicate with anyone or eve=
ryone, can access virtually any information that has ever existed. People l=
ive, work, learn, and love almost entirely online. Virtually all of the con=
stituent components of the vision of the 1990=E2=80=99s have come literally=
 true.
And yet, and yet. As Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid, once said, =E2=80=
=9CI didn=E2=80=99t say you=E2=80=99re all going to be happy. You=E2=80=99l=
l be unhappy =E2=80=93 but in new, exciting and important ways.=E2=80=9D
Why isn=E2=80=99t everyone happy? I think it=E2=80=99s that the technology =
industry went from building tools -- operating systems, and databases, and =
routers, and word processors, and browsers -- that other people picked up a=
nd used, to becoming the center of virtually every major societal and polit=
ical debate and dispute on the planet, in almost a single step.
One way to think about it is that we went from being pirates to being the N=
avy. People may love pirates when they=E2=80=99re young and small and scrap=
py, but nobody likes a Navy that acts like a pirate. And today=E2=80=99s te=
chnology industry can come across a lot like a Navy that acts like a pirate=
=2E=C2=A0
On the other hand, a Navy without pirates isn=E2=80=99t necessarily great e=
ither -- a suppressive force that prevents new ideas and new activities fro=
m forming, a global orthodoxy and set of rules that lead to the death of cr=
eativity -- which creates the opportunity, and the need, for a new generati=
on of pirates.
Machiavelli in his Discourses stresses the need for a state to go back to t=
he well, to its original founding ideas, to find renewal in later and darke=
r times. I think this same principle applies to companies and industries. I=
 think we should make a practice of revisiting the founding ideas of the te=
chnology industry -- certainly the 1990s of John Perry Barlow=E2=80=99s A D=
eclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace and Tim May=E2=80=99s Cypherno=
micon -- but also the 1950=E2=80=99s and 1960=E2=80=99s of Doug Engelbart a=
nd Ted Nelson, the 1920=E2=80=99s of David Sarnoff and Philo Farnsworth, th=
e 1890=E2=80=99s of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, even the 1500=E2=80=99s=
 of Leonardo da Vinci. I think we should view the unrealized -- or imperfec=
tly realized -- ideas from all those eras as not lost but not yet found.
N.S.: Let's talk a bit about competition between the U.S. and China. How wo=
rried should we be that China is -- at least, according to the World Bank's=
 numbers -- far ahead of us in the volume of high-tech exports? Should we w=
orry about Chinese dominance of networking tech or drones, or their big pus=
hes in the semiconductor industry and A.I.? And if we should be worried, ho=
w should America respond?
M.A.: This is a classic on the one hand, on the other hand puzzle, linked t=
o our propensity to want to punish ourselves to make ourselves feel good. H=
ere's what I mean: On the one hand, China developing into a powerhouse of t=
echnological innovation would be good for the world, because new technologi=
es don't tend to stay hoarded; they are ideas at heart, and ideas tend to p=
roliferate and become adopted widely. Economist William Nordhaus long ago s=
howed that 98% of the economic surplus created by a new technology is captu=
red not by its inventor but by the broader world; I think this obviously ho=
lds true not just at the level of an inventor or a company but also of a co=
untry. Ideas created in America have made the whole world immeasurably rich=
er, and I think the same will happen due to ideas created in China.
On the other hand, China has a strategic agenda to achieve economic, milita=
ry, and political hegemony by dominating dozens of critical technology sect=
ors -- this isn't a secret, or a conspiracy theory; they say it out loud. R=
ecently the tip of their spear has been networking, in the form of their na=
tional champion Huawei, but they clearly plan to apply the same playbook in=
to artificial intelligence, drones, self-driving cars, biotech, quantum com=
puting, digital money, and etc. Many countries need to consider very carefu=
lly whether they want to run on China Inc.'s technology stack with all of t=
he downstream control implications. Do you really want China to be able to =
turn off your money?
In the meantime, the West's technology champion, the United States, has dec=
ided to self-flagellate -- both political parties and their elected represe=
ntatives are busily savaging the US technology industry every way they poss=
ibly can. Our public sector hates our private sector and wants to destroy i=
t, while China's public sector works hand in glove with its private sector,=
 because of course it does, it owns its private sector. At some point, we m=
ay wish to consider whether we should stop machine-gunning ourselves in the=
 foot at the start of this quite important marathon.
N.S.: If you could give some advice -- career advice, or otherwise -- to a =
smart 23-year-old American today, what would it be?
M.A.: Don=E2=80=99t follow your passion. Seriously. Don=E2=80=99t follow yo=
ur passion. Your passion is likely more dumb and useless than anything else=
=2E Your passion should be your hobby, n=
ot your work. Do it in your spare tim=
e.
Instead, at work, seek to contribute. Find the hottest, most vibrant part o=
f the economy you can and figure out how you can contribute best and most. =
Make yourself of value to the people around you, to your customers and cowo=
rkers, and try to increase that value every day.
It can sometimes feel that all the exciting things have already happened, t=
hat the frontier is closed, that we=E2=80=99re at the end of technological =
history and there=E2=80=99s nothing left to do but maintain what already ex=
ists. This is just a failure of imagination. In fact, the opposite is true.=
 We=E2=80=99re surrounding by rotting incumbents that will all need to be r=
eplaced by new technologies. Let=E2=80=99s get on it.

A.: The 15 months since I wrote <em>It&#8217;s Time To Build</em> have been=
 dominated by three big events: the catastrophe of COVID, the systematic fa=
ilure of virtually all public sector entities around the world (the formerl=
y high functioning Asian nations are failing to vaccinate quickly), and the=
 remarkable success of the private sector and in particular the American te=
chnology industry in helping us all get through this pandemic in far better=
 collective shape that we had any right to expect. (See my new essay <em><a=

nic collapse of state capacity virtually everywhere in our time, the privat=
e sector can and does deliver even under considerable duress, and even when=
 much of our political system is devoted to stifling it with regulatory han=
dcuffs and damaging it with misguided policies.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a=
1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Now, God knows =
there is still a lot to build. For starters, most of our country, as well a=
s most of the world, does not yet have the remarkably advanced standard of =
living that the elite readers of this interview have come to expect. Consid=
er the three primary markers of the American Dream, or more generally middl=
e class success -- housing, education, and health care. You have written at=
 length on how all three of these success markers seem further and further =
out of reach for many regular people. I think -- and you would agree? -- th=
at these three deficits are not only causing problems for how people live a=
nd how the economy functions, but are fouling our politics quite dramatical=
ly.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; marg=
in: 0 0 1em 0;">Housing, education, and health care are each ferociously co=
mplex, but what they have in common is skyrocketing prices in a world where=
 technology is driving <em>down</em> prices of most other products and serv=
ices. (See chart below.) I think we should build in the next decade new tec=
hnologies, businesses, and industries that break these price curves -- and =

 at least in the domains where software-driven innovation is allowed. It&#8=
217;s been a decade since I wrote my essay <em>Software Eats The World</em>=
, and the case I made in that essay is even more true today. Software conti=
nues to eat the world, and will for decades to come, and that&#8217;s a won=
derful thing. Let me explain why.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size:=
 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">First, a common criticism of =
software is that it&#8217;s not something that takes physical form in the r=
eal world. For example, software is not a house, or a school, or a hospital=
=2E This is of course true on the surfac=
e, but it misses a key point.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em=
 0;">Software is a <em>lever</em> on the real world.</p><p style=3D"color: =
#1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Someone wr=
ites code, and all of a sudden riders and drivers coordinate a completely n=
ew kind of real-world transportation system, and we call it Lyft. Someone w=
rites code, and all of a sudden homeowners and guests coordinate a complete=
ly new kind of real-world real estate system, and we call it AirBNB. Someon=
e writes code, etc., and we have cars that drive themselves, and planes tha=
t fly themselves, and wristwatches that tell us if we&#8217;re healthy or i=
ll.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; marg=
in: 0 0 1em 0;">Software is our modern alchemy. Isaac Newton spent much of =
his life trying and failing to transmute a base element -- lead -- into a v=
aluable material -- gold. Software is alchemy that turns bytes into actions=
 by and on atoms. It&#8217;s the closest thing we have to magic.</p><p styl=
e=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;=
">So instead of feeling like we are failing if we&#8217;re not building in =
atoms, we should lean as hard into software as we possibly can. Everywhere =
software touches the real world, the real world gets better, and less expen=
sive, and more efficient, and more adaptable, and better for people. And th=
is is <em>especially</em> true for the real world domains that have been le=
ast touched by software until now -- such as housing, education, and health=
 care.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; m=

 It&#8217;s not so much what is lacking in the incumbents. It&#8217;s more =
the importance of communication as the foundation of everything that people=
 do, and how we open up new ways for people to communicate, collaborate, an=
d coordinate. Like software, communication technology is something that peo=
ple tend to pooh-pooh, or even scorn -- but, when you compare what any one =
of us can do alone, to what we can do when we are part of a group or a comm=
unity or a company or a nation, there&#8217;s no question that communicatio=
n forms the backbone of virtually all progress in the world. And so improvi=
ng our ability to communicate is fundamental.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a=
; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Clubhouse is the =
Athenian agora come to life, globally. I mean that seriously. Clubhouse is =
the first venue for people anywhere in the world to come together in groups=
 to <em>talk</em> -- not metaphorically, but literally -- about any topic t=
hey can imagine. It&#8217;s so striking that in our primarily textual techn=
ological world, people are instantly enthusiastic about the opportunity to =
participate in oral culture online -- there is something timeless about tal=
king in groups, whether it&#8217;s around a campfire 5,000 years ago or on =
an app today.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: =
26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Substack is the business model for intellectual c=
reativity that&#8217;s been missing on the Internet for 30 years. I&#8217;m=
 so excited about this. Substack isn&#8217;t a new form of communication; i=
n fact it&#8217;s the original form of Internet communication -- the writte=
n essay, the IETF Request for Comments, the newsgroup posting, the group em=
ail, the blog post. But until now you could never get <em>paid</em> for wri=
ting online, and now all of a sudden you can. I think it&#8217;s hard to im=
agine how transformational this is going to be.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a=
1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Substack is cau=
sing enormous amounts of new quality writing to come into existence that wo=
uld never have existed otherwise -- raising the level of idea formation and=
 discourse in a world that badly needs it. So much of legacy media, due to =
the technological limitations of distribution technologies like newspapers =
and television, makes you stupid. Substack is the profit engine for the stu=

et not protected by a monopoly position or regulatory capture, the nature o=
f competition in the industry changes until the best software wins, which m=
eans the best software company wins. The best software company may be an in=
cumbent or a startup, whoever makes the best software.</p></li></ol><p styl=

">My partner Alex Rampell says that competition between an incumbent and a =
software-driven startup is &#8220;a race, where the startup is trying to ge=
t distribution before the incumbent gets innovation&#8221;. The incumbent s=
tarts with a giant advantage, which is the existing customer base, the exis=
ting brand. But the software startup also starts with a giant advantage, wh=
ich is a culture built to create software from the start, with no need to a=
dapt an older culture designed to bend metal, shuffle paper, or answer phon=
es.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; marg=
in: 0 0 1em 0;">As time passes, I am increasingly skeptical that most incum=
bents can adapt. The culture shift is just too hard. Great software people =
tend to not want to work at an incumbent where the culture is not optimized=
 to them, where they are not in charge. It is proving easier in many cases =
to just start a new company than try to retrofit an incumbent. I used to th=
ink time would ameliorate this, as the world adapts to software, but the pa=
ttern seems to be intensifying. A good test for how seriously an incumbent =
is taking software is the percent of the top 100 executives and managers wi=
th computer science degrees. For a typical tech startup, the answer might b=
e 50-70%. For a typical incumbent, the answer may be more like 5-7%. This i=
s a <em>huge</em> gap in software knowledge and skill, and you see it play =
out every day across many industries.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-s=

gence, as an engineer myself, it&#8217;s hard to be quite as romantic as a =
lot of observers tend to be. AI -- or, to use the more prosaic term, Machin=
e Learning -- is an incredibly powerful technology, and the last decade has=
 seen explosive AI/ML innovation that&#8217;s increasingly showing up in th=
e real world. But it&#8217;s still just software, math, numbers; the machin=
es aren&#8217;t becoming self aware, Skynet is not here, computers still do=
 exactly what we tell them. So AI/ML continues to be a tool used by people,=
 more than a replacement for people.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-si=
ze: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">A famous story from the bi=
rth of computer science has Alan Turing, father of the computer, lunching w=
ith Claude Shannon, father of information theory, in the AT&amp;T executive=
 dining room near Bell Labs in the early 1940s. Turing and Shannon engage i=
n an increasingly heated discussion about the future of thinking machines w=
hen Turing stands up, pushes his chair back, and says loudly, &#8220;No, I&=
#8217;m not interested in developing a powerful brain! All I&#8217;m after =
is a mediocre brain, something like the President of AT&amp;T.'"</p><p styl=
e=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;=
">I think about AI like that -- although, for the record, the President of =
AT&amp;T is a friend of mine, and he&#8217;s actually quite bright. I suspe=
ct &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; is the wrong framing for the techn=
ology; Doug Engelbart was probably more correct with what he called &#8220;=
Augmentation&#8221;, so think &#8220;Augmented Intelligence&#8221;. Augment=
ed Intelligence makes machines better thought partners for people. This con=
cept is clearer for considering both the technological and economic consequ=
ences. What we should see in a world of rapidly proliferating Augmented Int=
elligence is the opposite of a jobless dystopia -- productivity growth, eco=
nomic growth, new job growth, and wage growth.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1=
a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">And I think this=
 is exactly what we are seeing. It&#8217;s worth remembering that before CO=
VID, only 18 months ago, we were experiencing the best economy in 70 years =
-- rising wages, low and falling unemployment, and essentially zero inflati=
on. The economy was even improving <em>more</em> for lower skill and lower =
income people than it was for people like us, despite computers everywhere.=
 Unemployment among the most disadvantaged in our society -- people without=
 even high school degrees -- was as low as it&#8217;s ever been. This is fa=
r from an automation-driven dystopia; in fact, it&#8217;s the payoff from t=
hree centuries of increasing mechanization and computerization. As the econ=
omy recovers from COVID, I expect these positive trends to continue.</p><p =

n: 0 0 1em 0;">First, COVID is the ultimate cover for restructuring -- what=
 my friend and former CFO Peter Currie used to call &#8220;shake and bake&#=
8221;. It&#8217;s an opportunity for every CEO to do all the things he/she =
may have wanted to do in the past to increase efficiency and effectiveness =
-- from fundamental headcount resizing and reorganization, to changing geog=
raphic footprint, to exiting stale lines of business -- but couldn&#8217;t =
because they would cause too much disruption. The disruption is happening a=
nyway, so you might as well do everything you&#8217;ve always wanted to do =
now.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; mar=
gin: 0 0 1em 0;">Second, it&#8217;s hard to overstate the positive shock th=
at remote work <em>works</em>. Remote work isn&#8217;t perfect, there are p=
roblems, but virtually every CEO I&#8217;ve talked to over the last year ma=
rvels at how well it works. And remote work worked under the extreme duress=
 of a pandemic, with all of the human impact of lockdowns and children unab=
le to go to school and people being unable to see their friends and extende=
d families. It will work even better <em>out</em> of COVID. Companies of al=
l shapes, sizes, and descriptions are retooling their assumptions on geogra=
phic footprint, where jobs are located, where employees are located, how of=
fices are configured, and if there should be offices at all.</p><p style=3D=
"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Co=
mbining these factors, it&#8217;s possible that we&#8217;ll see a huge surg=
e in productivity growth over the next 5 years. This productivity growth is=
, in my view, the key to a strong &#8220;roaring 20&#8217;s&#8221; thesis, =
that we are going to see an amazing economic boom in the US over the next s=
everal years, even on top of the incredible boom of 2009-2020. I don&#8217;=
t think that&#8217;s a certainty, but I think it&#8217;s possible -- even l=
ikely.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; m=
argin: 0 0 1em 0;">Third, this isn&#8217;t just a dramatic change in how co=
mpanies operate, it&#8217;s also an equally dramatic change in how individu=
als live and work. For anyone who does his/her job mainly with other people=
 and/or through a screen -- an increasing percent of the workforce every ye=
ar, and most people with college degrees -- this is an opportunity to rethi=
nk everything from what career to pursue, to what employer to work for, to =
where to live, to <em>how</em> to live. We are already seeing a huge surge =
in job turnover at big tech companies, driven by the employees as much as t=
he employers, and I expect this to continue as people reconfigure their liv=
es for the new choices of the post-COVID world. The biggest change is the u=
ncoupling of where you live from where you work, but even beyond that, I th=
ink a lot of people may choose to live very different lives coming out of t=
his -- forming new kinds of intentional communities, for example.</p><p sty=
le=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0=
;">And then there&#8217;s the fact that most employers in the past couldn&#=
8217;t hire most potential workers due to geographic constraints, but now t=
hey can -- talent may not actually be distributed equally, but it&#8217;s c=
ertainly distributed far more than companies and workers have been able to =
take advantage of -- and all of a sudden, the opportunity to far more effec=
tively match employer and worker all over the world exists.</p><p style=3D"=

 this all up, and you have a potentially massive unlock of latent economic =
growth potential in the US and around the world. Many more people fitted in=
to better jobs, more spending power creating more demand, more new industry=
 and business creation, more job growth and wage growth&#8230;I don&#8217;t=

ncy and trust. This is something the Internet has never had, but now it doe=
s, and I think it will take 30 years to work through all of the things we c=
an do as a result. Money is the easiest application of this idea, but think=
 more broadly -- we can now, in theory, build Internet native contracts, lo=
ans, insurance, title to real world assets, unique digital goods (known as =
non-fungible tokens or NFTs), online corporate structures (such as digital =
autonomous organizations or DAOs), and on and on.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a=
1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Consider also=
 what this means for incentives. Up until now, collaborative human effort o=
nline either took the form of a literal adoption of real-world corporate no=
rms -- a company with a web site -- or an open source project like Linux th=
at had no money directly attached. With crypto, you can now create thousand=
s of new kinds of incentive systems for collaborative work online, since pa=
rticipants in a crypto project can get paid directly without a real-world c=
ompany even needing to exist. As great as open source software development =
has been, far more people are willing to do far more things for money than =
for free, and all of a sudden all those things become possible and even eas=
y to do. Again, it will take 30 years to work through the consequences of t=
his, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s crazy that this could be a civiliza=
tional shift in how people work and get paid.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a=

iel has made the characteristically sweeping observation that AI is in some=
 sense a left wing idea -- centralized machines making top-down decisions -=
- but crypto is a right wing idea -- many distributed agents, humans and bo=
ts, making bottom-up decisions. I think there&#8217;s something to that. Hi=
storically the tech industry has been dominated by left wing politics, just=
 like any creative field, which is why you see today&#8217;s big tech compa=
nies so intertwined with the Democratic Party. Crypto potentially represent=
s the creation of a whole new category of technology, quite literally right=
 wing tech that is far more aggressively decentralized and far more comfort=
able with entrepreneurialism and free voluntary exchange. If you believe, a=
s I do, that the world needs far more technology, this is a very powerful i=
dea, a step function increase in what the technology world can do.</p><p st=

 venture capital itself, offering more extensive services to portfolio comp=

e: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">M.A.: There&#8217;s somethi=
ng very old about what venture capital is -- Tyler Cowen uses the term &#82=
20;project evaluation&#8221;, the process of sorting through many possible =
configurations of people and ideas and then picking a few to back with mone=
y and effort to try to create something new and important in the world. In =
venture capital, this idea traces back to the whaling industry of centuries=
 past, where independent financiers would fund captains and ships to hunt w=
hales -- legend has it this is the origin of the term &#8220;carried intere=
st&#8221;, which originally meant the share of the whale carried by the shi=
p and kept by the captain and crew. The same &#8220;project evaluation&#822=
1; pattern has played out repeatedly for centuries, for many kinds of large=
-scale, risky projects, from colonial settlements like the Plymouth colony,=
 to music/film/television projects, to the world&#8217;s largest private eq=
uity transactions.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-hei=
ght: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">But of course there&#8217;s also something v=
ery new about what venture capital is -- we fund the most cutting edge idea=
s and projects in the world, brand new conceptions of what technology makes=
 possible. The founders we fund routinely break rules and create new models=
 that people think are impossible until they happen. This includes many of =
the leading edge crypto ideas I discussed above, many of which assume a ver=
y different form of industrial organization than a classic joint stock comp=
any.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; mar=
gin: 0 0 1em 0;">So we sit at the vortex of this combination of the very ol=
d and the very new. It&#8217;s certainly possible that venture capital itse=
lf gets pulled into this vortex and comes out the other side radically tran=
sformed, and in fact this is what some of the smartest crypto experts are p=
redicting. And yet&#8230;there is, at least so far, no substitute to someon=
e doing the work of sorting and filtering all of the potential projects and=
 making big and risky bets. Is this Robert Michels&#8217; Iron Law of Oliga=
rchy for selecting, organizing, and funding risky ventures, regardless of w=
hat kind of technology is involved? I&#8217;m not sure, but maybe.</p><p st=

t I call the &#8220;little boy/big boy&#8221; pattern of how technology pro=
jects are funded and scaled. The &#8220;little boy&#8221; is the Silicon Va=
lley ecosystem that gets new ventures off the ground; the &#8220;big boy&#8=
221; is New York and the Wall Street world of stock markets and investment =
banks and hedge funds that tends to carry companies to scale during and aft=
er IPO. Maybe it&#8217;s time for Silicon Valley -- as a geographic locatio=
n, as a network of people, as a state of mind -- to take on a bigger role i=
n the economy, scaling our companies all the way to huge without ever handi=
ng them off to professionals on the other literal and metaphorical coast wh=
o may not understand and value them the way we do. We&#8217;ll see...</p><p=

/p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: =
0 0 1em 0;">One way to think about it is that we went from being pirates to=
 being the Navy. People may love pirates when they&#8217;re young and small=
 and scrappy, but nobody likes a Navy that acts like a pirate. And today&#8=
217;s technology industry can come across a lot like a Navy that acts like =
a pirate.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height=

8217;t necessarily great either -- a suppressive force that prevents new id=
eas and new activities from forming, a global orthodoxy and set of rules th=
at lead to the death of creativity -- which creates the opportunity, and th=

uld make a practice of revisiting the founding ideas of the technology indu=
stry -- certainly the 1990s of John Perry Barlow&#8217;s <em>A Declaration =
of the Independence of Cyberspace</em> and Tim May&#8217;s <em>Cyphernomico=

 I mean: On the one hand, China developing into a powerhouse of technologic=
al innovation would be good for the world, because new technologies don't t=
end to stay hoarded; they are ideas at heart, and ideas tend to proliferate=
 and become adopted widely. Economist William Nordhaus long ago showed that=
 98% of the economic surplus created by a new technology is captured not by=
 its inventor but by the broader world; I think this obviously holds true n=
ot just at the level of an inventor or a company but also of a country. Ide=
as created in America have made the whole world immeasurably richer, and I =
think the same will happen due to ideas created in China.</p><p style=3D"co=

- this isn't a secret, or a conspiracy theory; they say it out loud. Recent=
ly the tip of their spear has been networking, in the form of their nationa=
l champion Huawei, but they clearly plan to apply the same playbook into ar=
tificial intelligence, drones, self-driving cars, biotech, quantum computin=
g, digital money, and etc. Many countries need to consider very carefully w=
