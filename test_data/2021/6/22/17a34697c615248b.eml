Didn't see your response other than your email address before they closed
the session; let me know if you're around to talk about how you're managing
investing for an org that size - as an advisor on emerging tech for W50 I
get asked often how to effectively invest in innovation, and from what you
described I think you have the right approach!

Let me know if you have any time GMT in the next few weeks for a brief call
regarding.

Looking forward to it!
- J
