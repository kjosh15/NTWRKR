No problem; if it's uncomfortable, feel free to skip it! I just liked these
as starting points for discussions we may not have thought to have; or ways
to engage that we haven't before.

I'm really grateful that you've always been so open and available for
discussion (even uncomfortable ones!), but also recognize that you're the
only Dad I've got - so I'm happy to know you better however I can!

Love,
Josh
