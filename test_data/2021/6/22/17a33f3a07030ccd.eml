Josh,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The Multi-Domain SSL Certificate is currently set up with these domains:

h4xindustries.com    https://h4xindustries.com  redirects to https://www.josh.is/  as you had mentioned.  The SSL Certificate is only necessary if visitors are coming in to https://h4xindustries.com from their bookmarks or an internet search.

reputation-economics.com (alt)   Installed and working
indigometrics.com (alt)    Installed and working
thecrowbox.com (alt)    Installed and working

The Multi-Domain SSL Certificate can cover up to 5 domains, so one more additional domain can be added if needed.

It shouldn't be a problem to maintain functionality of the SSL Certificate for h4xindustries.com as it is migrated.   However, for us to answer this question in more detail, please reply with the account number and service that you plan to migrate h4xindustries.com to.  With this information we can give you more specific details regarding its migration and SSL Certificate installation.

Best regards,

James T.
