Thanks! I can't copy/paste all of my appointments going forward (that'd
mean I'd have to do everything twice), but setting the secondary calendar
to share with my main calendar instead of subscribed (which would give full
read/write permissions) would work. Do you know how to do that with google
cal?

Thanks!
Josh
