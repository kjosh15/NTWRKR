Thanks Jeffrey. Today my deposit went through and I was able to successfully=
 buy $50 of Ethereum. Not sure where I find the =E2=80=9Creceiving=E2=80=9D c=
ode that you requested below, but I did find a =E2=80=9Creferral=E2=80=9D co=
de. It=E2=80=99s 3dgu5b4zuz and I also sent to you as a link from the site. B=
ut I=E2=80=99m guessing that=E2=80=99s not the one you need.=20

So I also sent you the code below which was generated when I said that I wan=
ted to deposit Ethereum coin into my wallet and =E2=80=9Cshare=E2=80=9D the c=
ode.
0xCAF7c8C426C65e6d499345490d0081a4b807e868
That sounds more like what you need to transfer the shares. But if not, plea=
se let me know where to find the correct code.=20

Sorry I=E2=80=99m such a neophyte at this!=20
Best,
Gretchen
