Hey, a contact (from within New Labs, incidentally) contacted me to say
he's joined the Host Committee of the Oxford's Innovation Conference for
American Entrepreneurs that will take place at Oxford University in August
this summer.

The organizers are handpicking a delegation of 50 nominated business
owners, entrepreneurs, and executives to meet with the greatest innovators
from the Oxford academic community and to discover tech-driven business
models. He wanted to suggest me for the delegation, but...

I don't much trust the fellow and figured I'd ask if you knew anything
about it. Does any of the above ring a bell?

Hope you and yours are doing well, and much obliged!

All best wishes,
Josh
