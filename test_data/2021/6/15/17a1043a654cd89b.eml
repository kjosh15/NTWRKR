Is a Plant-Based Diet What You Need for Peak Performance?
---------------------------------------------------------

Maybe you were one of the people who leveled up your fitness
during the pandemic. Instead of wallowing in food, drink, and
Netflix, you started running and lifting weights.

Meanwhile, the fastest growing food trends in America are meat
and dairy alternatives. People from all walks of life are
embracing a plant-based lifestyle, when not long ago it was
considered fringe.

But do the two things go together? After all, when it comes to
peak athletic performance, we're often thinking it terms of
traditional protein sources -- meat, eggs, and milk.

Well, consider this. When Venus Williams had to withdraw from
competition due to an autoimmune disease in 2011, she not only
changed up her entire training regime, she also turned to a
plant-based diet (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u58dewo3i8h8dzggfo/48hvh7u02ko2dwaq/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhcnRyaWdodC5pbmZvL3doYXQtbWFkZS12ZW51cy13aWxsaWFtcy1mYWxsL=
WluLWxvdmUtd2l0aC1wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1kaWV0Lw=3D=3D
). The very next year she won a Wimbledon title, an Olympic Gold
Medal, and reclaimed her #1 world ranking.

Or consider NBA star Kyrie Irving. He adopted a planet-based
diet, hoping it would give him a competitive edge when he was
traded from Cleveland to Boston. Irving opened up about the "side
effects" of his new food choices (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u58dewo3i8h8dzggfo/wnh2h6uro8zo2ncl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9wbGFudGJhc2VkbmV3cy5vcmcvY3VsdHVyZS9uYmEta3lyaWUtaXJ2aW5nLXNpZGUtZ=
WZmZWN0cy1wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1kaWV0Lw=3D=3D
): "My energy is up and my body feels amazing."

Maybe you don't want to become a strict vegan. That's okay,
because Tom Brady's "plant-centered" diet of around 80%
vegetables (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u58dewo3i8h8dzggfo/reh8h9uq5n85ldt6/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cubm9tZWF0YXRobGV0ZS5jb20vaXMtdG9tLWJyYWR5LXZlZ2FuLw=3D=3D
) seems to be keeping him vibrant and collecting Super Bowl
trophies.

There's a new book out today called The Plant-Based Athlete (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u58dewo3i8h8dzggfo/08hwhgum7q876rcp/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzN3dTZ5ZXU=3D
). It's intriguing, so I'm giving it a read (although life
without eggs and cheese would be tough ... maybe I can do
"plant-centered" like Tom). I'm mainly motivated by the fact that
the meat and dairy industries are absolutely awful for animals
and the environment.

The book is by my friend Matt Frazier who runs the No Meat
Athlete (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u58dewo3i8h8dzggfo/8ghqh3ug5k456vul/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cubm9tZWF0YXRobGV0ZS5jb20=3D
) website. Matt's a marathoner and ultrarunner who discovered he
could run longer and faster on a plant-based diet.

His co-author is Robert Cheek, who puts to rest any dismissive
notions about gaining muscle as a vegan. Robert has followed a
plant-based diet for 25 years, and he's a two-time bodybuilding
champion.

This may not be your thing, but plant-based is no longer a fad.
And this new book is the only research-based guide for connecting
a plant-based diet with long-term strength, endurance, and peak
athletic performance.

I still go back to Michael Pollan's simple advice: "Eat food. Not
too much. Mostly plants." Turns out it may be even better advice
than anyone thought.

The Truth About Vegetable Seed Oils and Your Health

), which are also made with harmful vegetable oils. Consuming too
much of these detrimental substances can lead to brain fog,
fatigue, mood swings, weight gain, and migraines.

Better choices for your health and well-being can slide by if you
don=E2=80=99t read labels.

Vegetable Oils=E2=80=99 Slippery Slope
------------------------------

Just because the word =E2=80=9Cvegetable=E2=80=9D is in the mix doesn=E2=80=
=99t mean an
oil is healthy. As nutrition expert Dr. Cate says:

=E2=80=9CVegetable oils are the defining feature of junk food.=E2=80=9D
There are eight harmful seed oils found in packaged foods and
restaurant meals that make up most of the fat in a typical
American diet: canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran,
safflower, soy, and sunflower.

These oils are loaded with polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), which
create loads of free radicals that cause cell-damaging reactions
in our bodies. While we can withstand a modest amount of free
radicals, unhealthy seed oils flood our system with more than it
can handle.

This results in inflammation and negative impacts on circulation
and blood flow to the brain, increasing risk of heart disease,
diabetes, and other physical and psychological ailments.

Make Your Body a Well-Oiled Machine
-----------------------------------

This is why Dr. Cate advocates for eliminating harmful vegetable
oils from your diet.

=E2=80=9CIf you don=E2=80=99t first cut out all eight vegetable oils, it=E2=
=80=99s like
taking an aspirin for a headache before deciding to stop hitting
yourself on the head with a hammer.=E2=80=9D
Don=E2=80=99t worry, you can still get your fry on. Dr. Cate recommends
healthier oil options that can be used for cooking (or cold),
including avocado, olive, coconut, almond, macadamia nut, and
peanut. Butter, cocoa butter, tallow, and lard are also on Dr.
Cate=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Chealthy=E2=80=9D list.

Keep in mind that just because some of the harmful seed oils are
marketed as =E2=80=9Corganic,=E2=80=9D they=E2=80=99re not any healthier. T=
he PUFAs=E2=80=99
molecular structures remain the same, so you=E2=80=99re essentially
rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

Bottom line: Don=E2=80=99t buy the snake oil =E2=80=9Chealthy=E2=80=9D plan=
t-based goods
are selling =E2=80=94 read labels and avoid those eight harmful vegetable
oils. Grease is the word that you heard, and it definitely
affects the way that you=E2=80=99re feeling.

 Dr. Cate recommends healthier oil options that can be used for cooking (or=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Keep in mind that just because some of the harmful =
seed oils are marketed as =E2=80=9Corganic,=E2=80=9D they=E2=80=99re not an=
