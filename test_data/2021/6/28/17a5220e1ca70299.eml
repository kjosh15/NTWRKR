Andy,

That's... brilliant. I'd like a reel of myself to pitch our doing a joint
project. Here's a shortlist of CMO-types I've been in contact with recently=
:

Clayton F. Ruebensaal, EVP / CMO Global B2B Marketing, American Express
Denise Karkos, Chief Marketing Officer at SiriusXM
Tyrrell Schmidt, US Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Global Brand at TD
Sherry Sanger Chief Marketing Officer at Penske Transportation Solutions
Josh London, Chief Marketing Officer at Thomson Reuters
Justin Rounce, EVP & Chief Technology Officer at TechnipFMC
Nitin Mathur, Global Marketing and Digital Transformation Executive TE
Connectivity
Joel Johnson, Chief Marketing Officer at Pretzel
Jared Fix, Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) at Alto Pharmacy

Do any of those look approachable?

- J

ough multiple angles at once. <br><br>2. I can go to the following companie=

funded, Small-to-Medium sized businesses sortable by the size of their rece=

qualify for outreach:<br><br><a href=3D"https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/smal=

could start with a direct pitch for a Future of Work podcast pitch to Micro=
soft via Jaron and Jordan, and then try to formalize a qualification proces=

&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corporate podcast=
 like Accenture. This includes all development (creative), research, writin=

 and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the level we do.<br=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work process, it varies. However,=
 I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work together to bui=
ld and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the World 50 au=
dience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be given oppor=
tunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is =
a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, including: deve=
lopment (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, s=
hipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our productio=
n services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#39;t even track =
numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different vend=
ors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put togethe=
r a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize together on this and=
 help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive, so i=
t requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it sou=
nds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s only distributed to=
 members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It&#39;d =
be a private link essentially. So, long story short, we aren&#39;t a data-d=
riven company, we are a service oriented company. Might be good to include =
some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase=
, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Sch=
umer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

t;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chief of=
 Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re that group I&#=
39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hu=
gely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re structured =
into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each gro=
up to create a series of insights to share across all the groups and he lov=
ed it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50 had=
 been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had con=
sidered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T=
here are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructuring=
, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to media is going =
forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, and there i=
s no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll=
 try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is unlike=
ly.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them more f=
ormally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said=
 that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new =
head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with hi=
m for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
