How important / helpful is an advisory board to an early-stage startup? My
cofounder and I are trying to figure out if it's worth the effort to
make/manage one.

Right now we've got plenty of positive interest (mostly on the JV front),
and are struggling to improve our tech stack and onboarding/integration
processes to support current demand. We may also soon have an HBR article
on our use in D&I - and only myself and my white, male cofounder's pics on
the site. Do we need an advisory board right now?
