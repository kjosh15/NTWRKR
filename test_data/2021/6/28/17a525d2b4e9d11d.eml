Amazing - thank you so so much!! I've got my ticket, and am going in for my
second vaccination shot Wednesday. Let's chat more on the 2nd, but in the
meantime I may have some friends with an empty apartment near where I used
to live, which would be ideal as it sounds like there's a lot of stuff I'm
going to need to sort through and ship, toss, or bring back with me. It's
going to be a busy trip. :)

How goes your packing and prep? That's a big big move!!!

Love,
Josh
