 the growth journey of both W50 and the D&amp;I group. It struck me that al=
though I&#39;m moving very quickly with my data-led consortium there&#39;s =
no reason I can&#39;t just feed insights to you/your members as they&#39;re=
 discovered: much of what we&#39;re learning already is around the impact o=
f measurement and how accountability in DE&amp;I efforts affects different =
layers of the organization.<br><br>The only tricky bit is that if I bring i=
n non-W50 members we&#39;re going to have to do a lot of juggling to keep t=
heir material separate. The three companies we&#39;re talking to at the mom=
ent are all coincidentally members, but we&#39;ve also gotten a couple inqu=
iries from those who aren&#39;t.<br><br>If you had a short list of ~3-5 mem=
ber companies who are large, not in construction, telecomms, or beauty, and=
 who you think would be interested in tackling DE&amp;I issues with data I&=
#39;m happy to approach them first. So far we&#39;re batting 100% on the in=
vitations we&#39;d extended - I&#39;d rather prioritize W50 members first s=
o there are no problems with sharing with the group.<br><br>Let me know if =
you have any ideas, suggestions, or if I can be of any help on the other tw=
