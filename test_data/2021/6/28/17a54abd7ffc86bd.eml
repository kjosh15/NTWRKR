Hey Josh - It depends on the need and use. Some advisory boards are really
an extension of the company as employees as they do business development,
marketing, another kind of connections.

Other advisory boards in the early stages are more strategic as the
companies are scaling fast and so they will have the right people around
the ET team in place now versus later.

Then there are the "investor" advisory boards where you have a lot of
names...value-added is up to the founders.

For you, wow would the advisory board function and what you want from it
and how will it drive the why? That will help manage expectations and the
people you pick too....the question really becomes if you had that diverse
board on a pitch deck, would that help you right now?

You are pointing to the obvious, that you will have to get diverse either
on your team and the board...but since you still don't have the true
headcount yet, it can be difficult to share the diversity message on a deck
without people should you be pitching it investors who looking for that
too.

Advisory boards on not much of a headache if the expectations are clear,
cadence, agenda etc truthfully....it just can become one when you have a
lot of different personalities and investors with different visions too...

Not sure if that is helpful. Eventually, you know you need it...you know
the answer the best if you think not having one is holding you back or not.
You might be able to hold off it too.

Regards,
