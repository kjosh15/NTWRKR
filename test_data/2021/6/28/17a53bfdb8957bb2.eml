Joshua,

I=E2=80=99m not sure it=E2=80=99s a simple matter - especially since it=E2=80=
=99s very much an international business. It might be easier to inquire as t=
o whether corporate officer=E2=80=99s insurance is a part of the corporate d=
ocumentation or if, by some means unknown to me, officers are held harmless (=
my understanding is this is accomplished by the aforementioned insurance pol=
icy indemnifying corporate officers).

Good luck in your search. FWIW, I=E2=80=99ve acted as a corporate officer, f=
at, dumb and happy without insurance and had my partners (in Snoqualmie Wine=
ry) default on an SBA loan guaranteed by the former owners of Langguth winer=
y and I was never made a part of the lawsuit against Rohan and McCarthy (my t=
hen-partners). BUT that is not the normal circumstance. When we were in Germ=
any and I picked up our Passat I had lunch with the Langguth principal and e=
xplained the circumstances - Rohan and McCarthy trying to steal the winery -=
 and he, a- told his US attorney to NOT name us in the suit and, b- told the=
 attorney to call me for assistance as he was sure I would help them. Lesson=
 here: Being forthright has its advantages.=20

Love,
DAD

 Can you see any personal risk in my signing as CEO, and/or do you have any s=
uggestions on what to look for in our corporate paperwork? I'm trying to get=
 it all nailed down so I'm certain everything looks good as the company grow=
s, but any advice on what to watch out for is appreciated!
