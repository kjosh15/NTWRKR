We recently got a contract renewal and Chris asked if I would sign it as
CEO. I hadn't had a chance to read the contract and it was due shortly, so
I deferred to him and asked for time to get more comfortable with this
process. Can you see any personal risk in my signing as CEO, and/or do you
have any suggestions on what to look for in our corporate paperwork? I'm
trying to get it all nailed down so I'm certain everything looks good as
the company grows, but any advice on what to watch out for is appreciated!

love,
Josh
