Dan,

Pleasure speaking with you earlier today about our "Google Analytics for
Corporate Culture" platform.

I've attached an overview deck and a short intro video is here
<http://indigometrics.com>, but the gist is that we use a peer-to-peer
system to statistically model employee *behavior* (not sentiment). We've
been using it with some large multinationals around D&I and would love to
talk to Lauren Guthrie to get her take!

Finally, do let me know if I can help with your RFID efforts; I know the
Avery Dennison team has been doing a lot of work around their backend
software infrastructure.

Very much obliged,
Josh
