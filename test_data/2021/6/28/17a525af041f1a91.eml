Just following up. Let me know your plans the week of July 15th, as well as=
:

- What you'd like to pay for the items you want to keep and how much is
left on shipping.

- What you want to sell before you leave (so we can collaborate to get it
sold ASAP).

Finally, how has it been going with the landlord + services? Have they
stepped up at all, and/or have you heard anything back from them?

Thanks!
Josh
