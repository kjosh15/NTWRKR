Thanks, Oscar! Unfortunately trading air dates for host services doesn't
give me any better of a schedule to work with; can you please attach dates
to these deliverables, or at least the payment times?

Also, what is the chance of this spilling over into 2022? At present that's
going to be a very heavy lift given start dates on other projects.

Thanks!
Josh

This is a change to the earlier milestone of host services complete instead
of air dates.
