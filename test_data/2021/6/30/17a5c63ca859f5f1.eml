You probably saw this coming! ;)

I'd love to come speak at SXSW again, especially after all the madness of
this last year. I've been knee-deep in the future of work with senior
leaders from nearly every vertical and there's a tremendous amount of
practical on-the-ground insights that are being missed. What's the best way
forward?

Also, did you make it to CO, and if so how do you like it? We're likely to
stay in Iceland another year, but are starting to scope out where to head
to after that!

All best wishes,
Josh
