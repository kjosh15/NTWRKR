So crazy. Really glad you and yours are all ok!! You saw that they're now
using mRNA to deliver CRISPR alterations via the bloodstream?

Family here is good; they've lifted the state of emergency, >90% of the
population is vaccinated, and my kids are in a summer house with two
cousins their age. We've commandeered an RV for the summer and are just
following the weather - it's as though all our dreams of digital nomadism
suddenly rocketed into the present (although we'd never anticipated doing
it with kids...!)

Mostly I'm consumed with Indigometrics. If things are slow I'd love to get
your take on the potential for impact in governance; we're seeing time and
again that surfacing data around behavior is creating massive, systemic
change throughout our client organizations in hugely positive (if
challenging) ways. Weirdly, being so close to it is slowing my ability to
step back and see big picture and you're an absolute ninja at that
particular juggling act - if you're interested!

All best,
Josh

P.S. I'll be in NYC July 16th if you happen to be in the city - of if you
can think of anyone I should meet!
