Still pushing it; most of my time is being consumed with Indigometrics.com,
which is growing nicely, but I want to pitch the project to J&J in the next
couple months. Sutter Health in CA is interested, but they're bleeding cash
atm.

How has the rest of the pandemic treated you? It's been a minute!

Come on over to Iceland anytime!! We'll be here. Whereabouts in the country
are you planning to visit??

All best,
Josh
