I love the matchup of hacker and premium business consultant here. I knew
we'd find something to work on eventually!

There's a short video overview on our site <http://www.indigometrics.com>,
and I've also attached an overview deck.

In terms of times, does 10am EST any day the week of the 21st work for you?
Otherwise feel free to grab a time here <http://www.josh.is/scheduling> or
suggest something that works GMT.

Thanks again, Marla - I knew I could trust your opinion on the potential
for the platform in this space, and I'm delighted to hear there might be
more to explore. Looking forward to it!

All best,
Josh
