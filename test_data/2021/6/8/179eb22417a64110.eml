Dan,

Nate Padgett from Futureworks and informal suggested I contact you; I have
a SaaS company <http://indigometrics.com> that's growing very quickly and
we need to determine if it makes sense to file a patent (and if so of what
kind) and potentially a trademark.

Are you available to briefly discuss to see if you can help us?

Much obliged,
Josh
