Kes, Barbra, and J.J.,

Thanks again for a great call earlier today - I left it with a ton of
followup questions, which is always a good sign!

A few points to follow up on:

- Please send whatever NDA is appropriate here,
- Would love to connect with Claudia Saran
- Would love to connect to Mike Mather

Finally, please let me know when you can reconnect. I'd like a bit more
time to talk through what might work to trial the platform internally, how
to scope KPMG for our clients, and what the best path is to prove out
viability for KPMG's clients.

Really appreciate everyone's time, and I'm looking forward to learning more=
!

All best,
Josh
