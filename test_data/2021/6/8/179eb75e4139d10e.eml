Bill,

Let me know if you have time to briefly connect in the weeks ahead.
Indigometrics is growing fast and I've been advised to connect with
Blackstone about its utility as an ESG metrics tool. Would like to get your
reality check on this if I can!

Otherwise let me know if I can help you at all; cyber is blowing up ATM as
near as I can tell - it'd be useful to hear about what you've got in the
pipeline so I can point potential clients where relevant.

- J
