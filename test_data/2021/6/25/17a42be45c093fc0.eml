Thanks, Ron! Appreciate the kind offer; I'm going to be juggling clearing
out the last of the stuff in our old apartment and trying to cram in
business meetings so probably won't make it to LI, but as travel opens up
hope to have more reason to meet f2f either in NY or UK!

In the meantime, let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling>
work, or suggest something that works for you GMT. Looking forward to it!

All best,
Josh
