Please find attached a rough overview of what an Indigometrics <> Estee
Lauder engagement could look like based on our last conversation. I've also
included our latest overview deck.

Also, would you like to talk with David Wilson of Bechtel (another
Innovating 50 member) about his use of the platform? He's been using it for
about a year and has some pretty solid insights into its
applicability around the Inclusion and Equity space. He offered.

Finally, Wharton is still quite keen to find a way to work together; let's
confer reg. when we speak next week.

Have a great weekend!
- J

              <p class=3D"MsoNormal">Dear Carl, <br> <br> Great chatting wi=
th you last Friday, as always! I wanted to follow up on the Indigometrics o=
pportunity. <br> <br> As mentioned, we're currently working with Wharton's =
People Analytics team on a number of fronts. First, they've asked to publis=
h a white paper on our culture analytics as they see it as outstanding in t=
he field. Secondly, we are exploring using our platform to validate their C=
oachability studies due to our ability to flexibly measure behavior change =
over time. Thirdly, we are discussing working with one of their leading D&a=
mp;I professors on a collaboration to use data to provide measurement and a=
ccountability.<br> <br> We'd love to do a D&amp;I pilot with you as I know =
you're doing a lot of work in this area. Based on our conversation, there's=
 a lot of overlap! I've attached a two-pager highlighting where I see the g=
reatest potential, along with an overview deck. A short video overview is a=
vailable at <a href=3D"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=3Dhttp-3A=

le I'd love to see if there's opportunity for a pilot!<br> <br> Sincerely,<=
