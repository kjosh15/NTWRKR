Absolutely! Yes, I'll be helping close out the apartment and doing as many
business meetings as I can drag myself into, but an outdoor snack and a
walk through Travers sounds ideal.

BTW, thanks for the exceedingly kind response on houseguests. It was a very
useful reminder that I'm coming from somewhere that has grown
weirdly disconnected from the pandemic. It's strange as I tend to be very
conservative about the topic (after all, we're keeping our kids in Iceland
at least until they can be vaccinated!!) but obviously I'm not immune. Just
wanted to mention I appreciated the insight!

Looking forward to it,
Josh
