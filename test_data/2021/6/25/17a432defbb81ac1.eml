I worked the interviews into a new article structure 
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeZngxjZ1kBSy3Zuxc_BVlnC5CyNbhiDPOTYP79WyFA/edit?usp=sharing>; 
any feedback is appreciated!

Note that this version has everything and the kitchen sink in it; it's 
intended to be radically slimmed down. However, this gives us all the 
pieces to work with if the framework works for Bechtel.

Looking forward to discussing in our next meeting,
Josh
