Hey Josh,

For sure, the three that jump out to us are AMEX, Penske and TD Ameritrade.

   - AMEX: It looks like AMEX has dabbled in podcasting
   <https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/business-class-office-hours/id153=
8618247>
a
   bit which is a good sign.
   - Penske: Honestly, just because this brand is so ripe for great
   storytelling. Could definitely see a future of work podcast that include=
s
   their brand.
   - TD Ameritrade. We produced a show for them (like Accenture via T
   Brand) called Talking Green
   <https://open.spotify.com/show/31cpRN7ryb0FjUX7qkjHCM?si=3DacvWdE-fQsSSJ=
qMLbgA_ag&nd=3D1>.
   We wonder if there is an opportunity to leverage that.

For the reel, do you have moments in Built For Change
<https://open.spotify.com/show/3U20MqXwrI3fZpDYquwH6m?si=3DB4lVaT6iR8OxWBbY=
WnqrVQ&dl_branch=3D1>
that
you are particularly proud of? If you do, please send through episode names
and timecodes so we can be sure to include those clips. By the way, we
should probably only use clips that have already been released publicly.

Thanks Josh

and Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast strateg=
y that best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial=
 approval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoin=
ts along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all pro=
duction logistics, including: development (creative), research, writing, fa=
ct-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and =
exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting=
 at in our call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distribute t=
he shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, though). =
We rely on a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and=
 typically the clients put together a marketing plan as well. However, we c=
an strategize together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is=
 extraordinarily competitive, so it requires another budget for distributio=
n and marketing. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcas=
t; if it&#39;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case, distr=
ibution is super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long s=
tory short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented =
company. Might be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instea=
d: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, =
Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clini=
c and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=

t;&gt;&gt; Andy,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad we spoke the other day - I think =
I have a really good lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashins=
ky, the former editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at Wor=
ld 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti=
-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of =
the G100. They&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, C=
TO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast i=
nterviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights to share=
 across all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exact=
ly the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was much mo=
re practical than what he had considered (which was focused on interviewing=
 outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the =
other side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what =
their approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socia=
lize this internally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39=
;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources.=
 (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#3=
9;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull t=
ogether a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More critica=
lly, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon =
- I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this i=
dea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need=
 some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work proce=
ss breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me know wh=
at you think!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - J<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<=
br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic=
 cop&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group, decide=
 on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each group t=
o do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as we=
ll as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<br>&gt;=
