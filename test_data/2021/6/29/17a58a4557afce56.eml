Do you mind speaking to Carl Haney (Executive Vice President, Global R&D at
Estee Lauder) about Indigometrics? They're considering running a pilot and
he wanted to bring in his head of HR and ask you about your experience with
the platform. You probably already know Carl from Innovating 50.

Let me know if I can make a direct introduction; I'd be very much obliged!

All best,
Josh
