Totally understand and applaud your decision. I'll keep you posted on how
things evolve and if it's right for you to jump in later you're always
invited to the convo!

Keep me posted on how things go, let me know if you have an opinion on
offloading the entire tech stack and/or KPMG, and enjoy the hell out of the
shutdown!!!
