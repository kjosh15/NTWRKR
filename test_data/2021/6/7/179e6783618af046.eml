Morning Josh - so sorry for being silent on this. I have been off email for t=
he most part and trying to stick to my shut down.

For now I think I need to pass. I=E2=80=99m going to stick to my plan of not=
 engaging in anything before September at the earliest. Sorry that=E2=80=99s=
 not the ideal answer but it=E2=80=99s a slippery slope that once I start so=
mething I might as well be (or perhaps should be) into a dozen things to det=
ermine what=E2=80=99s right.

That said, happy to chat and help your projects where/if I can.=20

Thanks for following up...

Bruce=20
