Amy,

Thanks for a fun call; it was really refreshing to kick around some
thoughts on the financial services space (and the incipient opportunity for
innovation there!) with someone who knows it so well. I also
really appreciated getting your validation that it may be a good target for
my behavior analytics company.

Let me know if Kate Manfred would be up for a call on the latter, and/or if
you'd like to set up a followup call around the former!

All best,
Josh
