How's this for an edit?

@@@

Josh Klein and Hulda Emilsdottir recently moved to Iceland from NYC with
their two sons (5 and 8). Josh is a technologist with a background in
systems thinking and currently is the CEO and founder of Indigometrics, a
company culture metrics company, and Hulda is a research and business
strategist.

They=E2=80=99ve both become aware of the issues boys face in the education =
in
Iceland and are interested in creating systemic change to benefit school
children regardless of gender. Their children go to a small country school
outside Akureyri that happens to have a new principal taking over this fall
- which provides fertile ground for exploring methods to tackle the
problem, along with it being an election year.

If possible we'd like to connect to see how we can help improve this issue,
either via grassroots support or through external business connections.

Sincerely,
Josh and Hulda

xoxo,
Josh
