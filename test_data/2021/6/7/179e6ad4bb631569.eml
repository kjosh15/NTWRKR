nect the dots for you as far as the idea, number of NFTs, form, etc... As y=
ou mention in your email (pertinent text below), letting everyone know how =
selling through different formats works, and since you mention the Wild Wes=

 too.</div><div><br></div><div>Kehinde and Rosie, I have known Josh since h=

been at the forefront of various waves of technology for a few decades now,=
=C2=A0just look at his client list. I also can&#39;t resist adding his crow=

/div><div>Kehinde, why don&#39;t you give Josh an idea of the vision and sc=
ope of what you are thinking to get the conversation started. And if you do=
n&#39;t mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the background if=
 that is alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and =
NFTs are a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I c=
an help in any other way too.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>- Scott=C2=A0<=
/div><div><br></div><div><i>Email: We do indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat =
for him when we first moved to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture fram=
ed of ourselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It&#39;s our &quo=
t;epitome of NY experience&quot; photo, with a bagel shop in the background=
 and everything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock=
 sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#=
39;ve been working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto f=
or the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we =
realized we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of their=
s&#39; who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his =
security wrong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs=
 I can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell =
via personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild=
 west ATM so he&#39;s wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleri=
es) do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else =
I can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans=
, or some other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much=
 love back at you,<br>Josh</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>=
