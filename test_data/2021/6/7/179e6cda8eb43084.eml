Sounds good and keep me posted; in the meantime, I'm also speaking to the
CEO of Midwestern BioAg <https://www.midwesternbioag.com/>, who is also
interested in potential investment opportunities in Iceland.

Let me know when you're around and when/where/how I can help with Temasek.
(I don't want to step on any toes, but am happy to leverage a direct line
to the person doing the funding decisions over there!)
