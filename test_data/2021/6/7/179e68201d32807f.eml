iously, Kehinde has the vision for this and will connect the dots for you as=
 far as the idea, number of NFTs, form, etc... As you mention in your email (=
pertinent text below), letting everyone know how selling through different f=
ormats works, and since you mention the Wild West any specific risks or rest=
rictions associated with each format would help too.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20

. He has been at the forefront of various waves of technology for a few deca=

d if you don't mind, I would love to stay on the email thread in the backgro=

 and NFTs are a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if=
 I can help in any other way too.=20

f ourselves of a day we took his dogs out for a walk. It's our "epitome of N=
Y experience" photo, with a bagel shop in the background and everything. ;) G=
lad to hear he's still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> If he'd like to connect his timing is good. I've b=
een working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the W=
inklevoss twins and we'd been predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we w=
ere on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs' who had his=
 credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell N=
FTs I can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sel=

st ATM so he's wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20

iv><div><br></div><div>Kehinde and Rosie, I have known Josh since high schoo=
l. You can find his resume at&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://www.josh.is/" target=3D=
"_blank">https://www.josh.is/</a> if you are interested. He has been at the f=
orefront of various waves of technology for a few decades now,&nbsp;just loo=
k at his client list. I also can't resist adding his crow vending machine Te=

on't you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope of what you are thinking t=
o get the conversation started. And if you don't mind, I would love to stay o=
n the email thread in the background if that is alright, to see how this unf=
olds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs are a space I have been curious a=
bout too. Equally, let me know if I can help in any other way too.&nbsp;</di=

 indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him when we first moved to NYC (thank=
s to you!) and have a picture framed of ourselves of a day we took his dogs o=
ut for a walk. It's our "epitome of NY experience" photo, with a bagel shop i=
n the background and everything. ;) Glad to hear he's still doing great work=
; Blackrock sounds amazing.<br><br>If he'd like to connect his timing is goo=
d. I've been working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto f=
or the Winklevoss twins and we'd been predicting NFTs for a while - we reali=
zed we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of theirs' who=
 had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because he set up his security wr=
ong!<br><br>If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can certa=
inly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via personal b=
rand, gallery, or reseller first. It's very much the wild west ATM so he's w=
ise to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!<br><br>Feel free=
 to connect us directly, and let me know what else I can do to help. Otherwi=
se I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or some other place in t=
he year ahead for a proper catch-up!!<br><br>Much love back at you,<br>Josh<=
