Hey Josh,

I don=E2=80=99t mind the emails, but they just seem very formulaic, which i=
s
probably why I haven=E2=80=99t replied. I like to be useful to folks, and I=
=E2=80=99m not
sure I can be useful to you on any of the stuff you=E2=80=99re working on. =
So maybe
reach out if/when you think of something I can help you with?

Cheers!

Mike
