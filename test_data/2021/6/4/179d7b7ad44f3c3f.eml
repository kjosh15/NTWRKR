*TL;DR: Iceland's gov't wants to connect foreign investment looking to test
sustainability initiatives, and Indigometrics needs connections to PwC and
Deloitte and/or potential resellers (L&D specifically, data analytics
broadly). Can you connect me?*
# Working Capital

At present I'm still pushing to host a W50 podcast and have been approached
by Microsoft about a web-based live video series. Separately, I'm working
with Business Iceland (the Icelandic Gov't PR arm) to consult on a number
of Sustainability initiatives. If you (or someone you know) is looking for
a country with cheap electricity and lots of clean water who wants to
provide incentives to foreign investors to support sustainability, please
connect!

As soon as Indigometrics acquires another customer I'll start taking a
salary and these efforts will go on the shelf of things to keep an eye on
(but not actively pursue) - an exciting but daunting prospect after a
decade and a half of juggling multiple opps at all times!!

# Indigometrics

Indigometrics is breaking even (albeit without a salary for my cofounder
and I). This happened faster than expected and thereby changes our
strategy. At the same time, KPMG is interested in partnering with us -
leading to my expediting conversations with McKinsey and Accenture. We're
working on connections at Deloitte and PwC - if you have any connections
please let us know!

I'm rewriting our business plan in light of these changes, and we're
accelerating our partnership / reseller focus. Our main goals now are to
find a way to offload integration/support costs and establish a solid back
end infrastructure. If we can 3rd party both of those we should be in an
excellent position for acquisition once we reach a high enough ARR, which
seems to be happening organically.

Any feedback on the above is appreciated - this isn't following the script
for a B2B SaaS platform, so we're making it up as we go along, but all
signs are positive!

As ever, let me know how/if I can help you in turn!

- J
