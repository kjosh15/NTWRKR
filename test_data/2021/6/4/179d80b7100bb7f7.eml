Karl, Arnar;

I recently spoke with Zack Porter
<https://www.kirchnerpcg.com/team/zack-porter/>, who is introducing me to S=
teve
Howard
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-09/temasek-hires-former-ik=
ea-sustainability-head-as-hu-leaves-role>,
the new head of sustainability investment for Temasek
<https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index>, a very large generational investor
out of Singapore. Zach and Steve have been talking about new targets for
long-term investment and Zach was very keen on my description of Iceland as
a test bed for sustainability solutions.

That said, his emphasis (and Temasek's) is on investing in a broad
portfolio of opportunities to create systemic change. His view (and mine)
is that the world has enough one-off case studies, but that creating
powerful, nationwide change in a country like Iceland could act as a
lodestone for other nations to implement similar policies and solutions.

If that's a good fit, I'd like to present (broadly) the overview of the
areas of interest you shared with me to see if Steve would like to set up
some conversations with you (and the Icelandic gov't more generally) around
potential investment/partnership opportunities.

Let me know if that's interesting; Temasek has ~USD $200bn that Steve needs
to invest directly in world-changing initiatives; I'd love to see some of
that happen here!

All best wishes,
Josh
