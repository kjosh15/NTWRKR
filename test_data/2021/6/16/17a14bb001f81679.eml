My take is that I didn=E2=80=99t do enough homework beforehand and you just=
 did it
for me!! Apologies.

Secondary to that, it totally fits that the person who reached out would be
looking to sell this to me. I=E2=80=99ll approach it as =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99=
m happy to be a mentor
for a nominal fee=E2=80=9D but no, I=E2=80=99m not interested in paying for=
 a class to
teach me how to include tech in my startup.

Weirdly, I=E2=80=99m grappling with the opposite problem - it appears that =
part of
the playbook for SaaS startup sales is to employ 3rd party providers for
your tech stack so a buyer can mitigate integration costs, so we=E2=80=99re=
 now
looking at how/if to do that=E2=80=A6 it=E2=80=99s a strange world!

How are things on your end? Any news?
