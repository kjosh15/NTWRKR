e price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may refuse a=
 refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipu=
lative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim. Terms =

ily Sharing features.

Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing=E2=80=99s Purchase Sharing feature allows =
you to share eligible Content among up to six members of a Family. The Orga=
nizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Trans=
actions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's payment method is used=
 to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the F=
amily member=E2=80=99s account has store credit, which is always used first=
). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer=
=E2=80=99s payment method is used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay f=
or such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members=
 are authorized. Organizers are responsible for complying with their paymen=
t method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the pay=
ment method with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member=
 Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer. =20

approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equi=
valent age of majority in your Home Country). The Organizer must be the par=
ent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated=
. Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes may  not b=
e subject to Ask to Buy.

amily, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the for=
mer member=E2=80=99s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer=
=E2=80=99s payment method.

join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID yo=
u associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family membe=
rs must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purc=
hases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for P=
urchase Sharing.  Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One=
 Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+=
 subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing.  Subscriptions=
 shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per su=

Some Content available in certain Services are acquired by You from the thi=
rd-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or =
during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.  For e=
xample, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple. In=
 such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing th=
e Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction bet=
ween you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple =
Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is t=
he merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.=
g., Apple Books), but such Content is licensed by the Content provider.  Th=
e Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating =
to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Conten=

 is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iC=
loud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Con=

 Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple=E2=80=99s iCloud =
Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up =
to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store or Apple Music do no=
t count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for ex=
ample, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device =
are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Librar=

you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is provided by=
 Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carr=
ier=E2=80=99s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing dis=
putes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not=
 Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that you=

nd subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this informa=

 part of this Agreement, such as, by way of example, all or part of the ind=
emnification section, is invalid or unenforceable against you because of ap=
plicable local, national, state or federal law, then that portion shall be =
deemed invalid or unenforceable, as the case may be, and instead construed =
in a manner most consistent with applicable governing law.

GOVERNING LAW

Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Ag=
reement and the relationship between you and Apple, and all Transactions on=
 the Services shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, exc=
luding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Apple agree to submit to th=
e personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the coun=
ty of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from=
 this Agreement. If (a) you are not a U.S. citizen; (b) you do not reside i=
n the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the Service from the U.S.; and (d) yo=
u are a citizen of one of the countries identified below, you hereby agree =
that any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement shall be governed by =
the applicable law set forth below, without regard to any conflict of law p=
rovisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdict=
ion of the courts located in the state, province or country identified belo=
w whose law governs:

If you are a citizen of any European Union country or Switzerland, Norway o=
r Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your=
 usual place of residence.

Specifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known =
as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

OTHER PROVISIONS

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Apple and g=
overns your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements with resp=
ect to the same subject matter between you and Apple. You also may be subje=
ct to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate=
 services, third-party content, third-party software, or additional service=
s such as the Volume Purchase Program. If any part of this Agreement is hel=
d invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner con=
sistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original=
 intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full=
 force and effect. Apple's failure to enforce any right or provisions in th=
is Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such or any other provision. A=
pple will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to=
 causes beyond its control.

You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, stat=
utes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the Services. Y=
our use of the Services may also be subject to other laws. Risk of loss for=
 all electronically delivered Transactions pass to the acquirer upon electr=
onic transmission to the recipient. No Apple employee or agent has the auth=
ority to vary this Agreement.

Apple may notify you with respect to the Services by sending an email messa=
ge to your email address or a letter via postal mail to your mailing addres=
s, or by a posting on the Services. Notices shall become effective immediat=
ely. Apple may also contact you by email or push notification to send you a=
dditional information about the Services.

You hereby grant Apple the right to take steps Apple believes are reasonabl=
y necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any par=
t of this Agreement. You agree that Apple has the right, without liability =
to you, to disclose any data and/or information to law enforcement authorit=
ies, government officials, and/or a third party, as Apple believes is reaso=
nably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any=
 part of this Agreement (including but not limited to Apple's right to coop=
erate with any legal process relating to your use of the Services and/or Co=
ntent, and/or a third-party claim that your use of the Services and/or Cont=
ent is unlawful and/or infringes such third party's rights).

Children under the age of majority should review this Agreement with their =
parent or guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian un=
derstand it.

A. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES<br>
<br>
This Agreement governs your use of Apple=E2=80=99s services (=E2=80=9CServi=

, =E2=80=9CContent=E2=80=9D). Content may be offered through the Services b=
y Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your c=
ountry or territory of residence (=E2=80=9CHome Country=E2=80=9D). By creat=
ing an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory=
 you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need =
compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes req=
uired) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services=E2=80=99 performa=
nce may be affected by these factors.<br>
<br>
B. USING OUR SERVICES<br>
<br>
PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS<br>
<br>
You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of=
 which is referred to as a =E2=80=9CTransaction.=E2=80=9D Each Transaction =
is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity =
providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Ap=
ple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. =
is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services=
 (e.g., Apple Books, App Store, etc.) as displayed on the product page and/=
or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service. In such case, y=
ou acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is=
 licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), b=
ook publisher, etc.). When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you=
 to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transa=
ctions. If you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authent=
icate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for=
 Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facia=
l recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these=
 instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT204030. Apple will charge your s=
elected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/cod=
e, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transaction=
s, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple =
Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using=
 Apple Pay. If we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason=
 (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any=
 uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method agai=
n as you may update your payment method information. If you pre-order Conte=
nt, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you ca=
ncel prior to the Content=E2=80=99s availability). In accordance with local=
 law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method i=

t how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT5582=
. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If tec=
hnical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exc=
lusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of th=
e price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may refuse a=
 refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipu=
lative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim. Terms =
related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://ww=
w.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.<br>

 older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 o=
r the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country (as set forth in the reg=
istration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Fam=
ily Sharing features.<br>
<br>
Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing=E2=80=99s Purchase Sharing feature allows =
you to share eligible Content among up to six members of a Family. The Orga=
nizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Trans=
actions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's payment method is used=
 to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the F=
amily member=E2=80=99s account has store credit, which is always used first=
). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer=
=E2=80=99s payment method is used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay f=
or such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members=
 are authorized. Organizers are responsible for complying with their paymen=
t method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the pay=
ment method with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member=
 Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer.  <b=
r>
<br>
Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a convenient feature that allows an Organizer to =
approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equi=
valent age of majority in your Home Country). The Organizer must be the par=
ent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated=
. Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes may  not b=
e subject to Ask to Buy.<br>
<br>
Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the F=
amily, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the for=
mer member=E2=80=99s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer=
=E2=80=99s payment method.<br>
<br>
Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may =
join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID yo=
u associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family membe=
rs must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purc=
hases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for P=
urchase Sharing.  Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One=
 Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+=
 subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing.  Subscriptions=
 shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per su=
bscription basis.<br>
<br>
E. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION FEATURES<br>
<br>
The Services may recommend Content to you based on your downloads, purchase=
s and other activities. You may opt out from receiving such personalized re=
commendations for some Services in your account settings.<br>
<br>
Some recommendation features may require your permission before they are tu=
rned on. If you turn on these features, you will be asked to give Apple per=
mission to collect and store certain data, including but not limited to dat=
a about your device activity, location, and usage. Please carefully read th=

<br>
Some Content available in certain Services are acquired by You from the thi=
rd-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or =
during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.  For e=
xample, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple. In=
 such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing th=
e Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction bet=
ween you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple =
Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is t=
he merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.=
g., Apple Books), but such Content is licensed by the Content provider.  Th=
e Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating =
to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Conten=

 is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iC=
loud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Con=

loud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music=
 Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple=E2=80=99s iCloud =
Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up =
to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store or Apple Music do no=
t count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for ex=
ample, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device =
are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Librar=
y, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the de=

you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is provided by=
 Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carr=
ier=E2=80=99s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing dis=
putes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not=
 Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that you=
r carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number a=
