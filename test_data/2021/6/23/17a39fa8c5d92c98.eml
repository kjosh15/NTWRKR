Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) MediaTemple.

It appears that your site josh.is actually loads as www.josh.is. If you wanted to secure www.josh.is it needed to be added to the SSL with the prefix. As a courtesy, we have updated the SSL, you should be receiving an email with a new unique ID for www.josh.is. Please verify domain ownership like you previously did. Once this is verified, we can install the certificate for you. As of right now the site is down because the SSL does not match the name.

We do hope this information is helpful. Please let us know if there's anything else we can answer for you regarding the information in this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services, by calling us at 310-841-5500, or by opening a chat in the AccountCenter. We are here 24/7 to assist you. 

Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Leticia C.
