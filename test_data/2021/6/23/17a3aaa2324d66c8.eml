Thanks again for the help earlier today; I was never able to get the
Linksys router to work, but eventually found the old Huawei and it worked
with the IPTV straight away. I've lost the coverage the Linksys provided,
but don't have time to debug it now - we'll keep it as is until I can get
back to it later this summer.

Anyway, thanks for the help!
Josh
