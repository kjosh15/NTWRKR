Need to document this somewhere!

1. I plugged in the Huawei and the TV started working straight away.

2. The Linksys router, however, won't function anymore - we'll probably
have to take it back and complain when/if we move back in to Vidifell! I
saved the config file for it just in case.

3. I plugged the cordless phone into the "Phone 1" port - so there's a
chance that Vodafone can "just turn it on." I'm hoping. Otherwise I can
come back and fiddle with the settings (the Huawei seems to be what tech
support is most comfortable with.)

Love you!!
Josh
