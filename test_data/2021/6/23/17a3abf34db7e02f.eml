Arnar,

I've been speaking to a number of parties about the potential for indoor
farming here in Iceland, including the CTO of Cargill, a senior member of
Temasek (a big ag fund out of Singapore), and a large Ag fund based in the
USA.

Most recently I spoke to the founder of the first large-scale indoor
farming operation in the US, and who just left 80 Acres. (I'll be speaking
to their head of development next week as they may be a useful turnkey
partner and are interested in Nordic expansion.) He walked me through the
primary incentives, cost limiters, and opportunities in the space and
mentioned specifically that he thought that basing a large growing
operation next to a geothermal power generation plant would be optimal.

We discussed at some length the potential benefits to acquiring CO2 at the
site of production, potentially discounted pricing on power, ready access
to water, and associated elements such as recent advances in automation,
programming, and genomics that may play a role.

Given the breadth of potential investors it would be very useful to
understand better what Landsvirkjun thinks the opportunity might be so I
can help either shape a proposal or introductions to interested parties.

For example, the larger funds may be interested in as closed-loop a process
as possible to test market sensitivities prior to larger-scaled rollouts
across the EU / US, and may want to employ everything from a fully
automated hydroponic operation with hydrogen-powered shipping and advanced
genomics development with IoT product tracking across the entire Icelandic
market. The smaller funds may simply want to partner with a power/CO2
provider who can provide good pricing and optics around sustainability to
help drive larger market acquisition.

Either way, can you suggest who I should speak with?

Kv.,
