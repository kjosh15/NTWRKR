What we have now (if we add an IP Phone to the plan):

IPTV 2490
IPPhone 2490
2 phones 5580
Internet 8669
---
TOTAL 19229


What the Family plan includes:

IPPhone 1000 (extra)
IPTV
2 phones
Internet
Unlimited Data
Unlimited # of Kids Phones (2GB of data/month, unlimited talk and text)
---
TOTAL 20990

My take is that we're going to move to a cell plan for O eventually, but
for now we don't need either the IPTV or the IPPhone (b/c if we have
internet we can call folks via Skype / Signal / Whatsapp / FaceTime /
GVoice), which brings our cost down to 14249/month - as long as our data
usage stays within our current usage limits. What do you think?

xoxo,
Josh
