We just got paid the first allotment for Season 2 - $22k. We should also
get ~$20k in tax refunds over the next couple weeks. Let's review by the
end of July with an eye to pay off the 0% interest card.

Otherwise, we have:

Pers Chkg: $10748.37
H4X Chkg: $16,161

and all CC's (other than the 0% interest one) paid off.

I spoke to Sturla and we need to come up with a monthly salary amount. We
can adjust it as we go, and it'll cost us 10k ISK/month for him to operate,
but it should diminish our tax overhead here in Iceland.

xoxo,
Josh
