You've been doing an amazing job! The learning curve on NFTs is pretty
steep even for techies, so I'd say you get top marks across the board.
Thanks for bringing me along for the ride!

I'd preface my comments by saying that your stock answer that nobody is
likely to buy it is probably a rational one. That's never held me back,
however, so here are my thoughts on marketing:

- AFAIK this is the first *NFT prediction* (blockchain prediction markets
are common, however). As you've seen, firsts in NFTs are the primary driver
of the market. Everyone has FOMO that "this thing" is going to be huge and
nobody wants to miss the next Bitcoin.

- If you can infect potential buyers with that fear of missing out, you can
drive a lot of demand.

- A way to exacerbate that demand is with the time-limited drop auction.
I.e., make it available to buy to the highest bidder by a certain date, and
then promote the hell out of it with increasing fervor up to that date to
drive appetite and create a bidding war.

- You have access to W50, which is an uneducated group of potential buyers
who are aware of NFTs and uncertain about the impact/value. You have a
product which is NFT-native, and thereby "safe" from many of the vague
fears around the market. I.e., it's a perfect hedge purchase against an
incipient and poorly-understood opportunity.

Given all that, what I would do is design a drop auction and promote it
with increasing frequency over the course of a month up to the final date.
You can do that via direct email, email newsletters, the W50 app, or
whatever suits W50 best. Position it as a way for W50 members to safely dip
their toe in the NFT waters, giving them easy, first-person exposure to
(and understanding of) this crazy new technology/market/disruptor.
Emphasize that it's likely to be value-less, and simultaneously hype up the
bragging rights that accompany its ownership.

In other words, set up any buyers to learn a ton and have a safe, guided,
light-touch first-person exposure to NFTs, with the winner taking all and
owning bragging rights over all the other W50 members.

If it's helpful, I can offer to spend time with anyone who is interested in
learning more and/or help them get their wallets set up to make a bid.

Let me know if that makes sense / sounds appealing - as ever, this is just
my $0.02. If nothing else, all of this definitely positions what you're
building as a thought leading forum to watch that is doing more than just
talking about things!!!

All best,
Josh
