Elyse,

Just spoke to Mike Mudrey and wanted to check in to see if I could be of
any help. If you're looking to bounce ideas around or spark thinking about
potential growth paths I'd love to reconnect. Otherwise feel free to hit me
up at any point in future; I'm really looking forward to our more-in-person
future!!

All the best,
Josh
