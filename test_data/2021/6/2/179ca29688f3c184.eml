Alumni on Clubhouse:

*Today is your lucky day.* You were either in the founding Clubhouse room
or in the NFT Clubhouse room. Our brave NFT leader Josh Klein has recorded
a prediction about how "accurate predictions about value creation" will in
themselves become valuable. We minted the attached NFT and will be sharing
the NFT 12 ways in what are called "fractions" among the 12 Alumni copied
here.

In case you were wondering what we did? We created the attached audiovisual
and minted it on rarable before discovering we could not do shares on
Rarable so we transferred it to Openseas. Then we downloaded an Ethereum
wallet called MetaMask and bought the minimum $50 in Ethereum (which has
since gone up a bit). We then transferred the NFT to Niftex to create 12
equal fractions which we transferred back to our Metamax wallet and we are
ready to distribute your share to you (Whaaaaaat?).

What you need to do now: *Download a Metamask wallet and buy $50 worth of
Ethereum* to activate your wallet and send me your receiving code so I can
send you your fraction of the Josh Klein NFT. All the costs of the NFT
minting process are being picked up by World 50 (except your $50 Ethereum
purchase).

We have to send all of the fractions at the same time - so we would like to
ask that all interested parties send their receiving code before Tuesday
June 15th. If only 10 candidates send receiving codes by then - we will
split the fractions 10 ways instead of 12.

From here on out we will be minting World 50 NFT predictions for each
Clubhouse room and distributing to everyone in the room. You can listen in
while multi-tasking or join the conversation on stage - either way you will
get your share of that NFT Prediction. We think the individual NFT's might
become valuable as well as the entire set as a collection so - Join us on
Clubhouse and collect your set.

The future is hard to predict but we can 100% guarantee your World 50
Productions: NFT predictions will be worth millions or pennies one day in
the future. =F0=9F=92=B0
