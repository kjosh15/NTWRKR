*TL;DR: We're focusing heavily on building partnerships
(KPMG/McKinzie/Accenture for consulting, L&D firms for content, Refinitive
for metrics) under the assumption that we will see a higher-value exit
sooner by leveraging them for sales and support. Is that smart?*
We're getting a ton of validation from large consultancies that they'd like
to work with us, but they're slow. Numerous conversations with large
companies are proceeding similarly, and our existing customers keep
increasing the size of the employees they want to use our software on.

The catch is that we're constrained: our software can barely handle what
we've got already, we're still struggling to build more formal onboarding
processes, and our headcount (5) means we're all-hands-on-deck for singular
events like ISO certification (due this week) - delaying everything else.

The good news is:

a) ESG is exploding, and we're perfectly situated to capture the "S" in
 that acronym. I'm pursuing Refinitive (and a few other orgs) about how to
expand and validate our metrics more deeply in this area.

b) Churn is skyrocketing. Some surveys suggest that many firms may see as
much as 40% churn in the next year as employees attempt to find a better
deal en masse.

c) The Distributed Workforce trend isn't going away, meaning that culture
is becoming an immediate priority for big companies.

All good things: the question is how to capitalize on them. I'm working on
our revised business, growth, and exit plans now with a specific focus on
partnerships to enable faster growth by getting us out of building software
or supporting customers.

The idea here is that we could still enjoy SaaS-style margins (our
operational costs are extremely low) while focusing more heavily on data
analytics-led features, and eventually see revenue from our aggregate
metrics.

Is that sensible? Or are we missing the boat in trying to offload work to
partners who will see the lion's share of the benefit? Any advice is
helpful here!
