Hey Josh,

I'm so terribly sorry that I've fallen completely off the map for the past
9 months. I really feel awful about letting you down and not even being in
communication. I hope that you did take me off your Personal Advisory Board=
.

The past year has been one of the hardest of my life, and I've really been
struggling. Besides losing a few members of my family to COVID, I've just
been overwhelmed with work. I ended up not quitting my job at the college,
because all the financial opportunities for the nonprofit dried up at the
onset of the pandemic. So I've essentially been working two
more-than-full-time  jobs for the past year - trying to rescue the failing
nonprofit while also suffering through the stressful work of the college
job. Suffice to say, I ended up ignoring everything else. I feel like I've
been juggling a dozen flaming torches and most of them keep landing on the
ground, setting everything on fire in a drought-stricken region!

So I truly hope you can forgive me. I have literally more than 30,000
unopened emails between my four email inboxes, due to the email triage that
I've had to perform in responding to all the fires that need to be put out
every day.

The school year just ended, so my wife and I are going to take a personal
retreat for the next 7 weeks to reassess what we are doing with our crazy
lives. (As you might recall, she's also the director of a nonprofit and was
also struggling with extreme stress trying to rescue it from financial
disaster, as well as dealing with some serious health problems, even
*before* the pandemic hit last year.) She's encouraging me to quit my job
at the college, even though things are financially precarious for us.

I will be back in touch at the end of August with updates. Until then, I
just again apologize profusely. I should have written much early to let you
know about my struggles and my inability to follow up on everything I had
promised when agreeing to serve as a personal advisor.

Thanks so much for your patience and understanding. I hope you and your
family have managed to survive, and perhaps even thrive, during this crazy
past year.

Best,
Scott
