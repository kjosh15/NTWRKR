Hi Josh,

Thanks for reaching out. Your message was in my junk mail so apologies =
if I didn=E2=80=99t see an earlier correspondence from you. Looking back =
at previous correspondence with you, the last time we interacted was =
back in 2013 when I wrote to share my appreciation for R=E2=80=99ood =
which I=E2=80=99d just read. At present I=E2=80=99m reading the Dune =
Saga Collection so it=E2=80=99s funny that we meet again while I=E2=80=99m=
 reading another sci-fi novel.

At present I can attest to the fact that the world is a very different =
place since the pandemic. I myself have been recently laid off but have =
been volunteering with a group to help mentor some youths as they work =
in a new start-up lab which focuses on web design and programming. I =
haven=E2=80=99t been very familiar with your other work but my =
background has mostly been in IT Service Management. Would be happy to =
chat some more if you believe there is something we can innovate on =
together.

Regards,
Michael Reid
