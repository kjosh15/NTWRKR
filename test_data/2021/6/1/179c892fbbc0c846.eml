Hi Josh,

Thanks for reaching out:-). It's great to hear from you again ... how have
you been adjusting to this wild and strange new reality?  I hope well.

It was fun to look at some of your projects - all very cool.  I would love
to innovate on something with you down the road ... but am actually in the
midst of building out my energy healing practice (one of my spidey skills
is that I am clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient, claircognizant and a
medical intuitive).  After a spate of awful consulting clients who claimed
to be interested in social change but in truth had no ethics or
authenticity, I decided to move this 'side car' of mine front and center.
It has been a fun move ... and I'm mostly working via dr. and therapist
referral ... which I am super grateful for.  I'm planning big things in
terms of online knowledge sharing etc with this work ... it may sound
strange, but it fits perfectly in with everything I was already doing.

Bref, that is what is going on with me ... oh, and I survived a near death
illness too.  Lots and lots has happened since we last connected. I don't
know if I will finish my doctorate ... I had to leave 1/2 way through due
to health and then had to dig out of medical bills.  That is behind me now
... and I'm sitting with whether finishing is what I want to do.  We shall
see.  My project Sooth is still very much something I plan on doing ... but
down the road when this new structure is up and running.

Anyway, lmk if you want to connect via phone.

Hugs!

Shauna
