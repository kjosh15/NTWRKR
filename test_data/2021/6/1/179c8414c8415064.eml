Awesome, thanks! A couple things:

1) The doc you sent shows how to Mint an NFT, not how to set up the
required accounts / services so you can receive a shard.

2) Really curious what the marketing strategy is here; who is going to buy
this NFT when you mint it? When is it going to be available? Happy to help
here if that's useful.

3) I have a Metamask wallet, and in fact it's already connected to both
Coinbase and Opensea. My Metamask account # is:

0xD5c6AFfFC789bca507817b1eD100573E3Fe2651a

Let me know if you need anything else, and thanks for doing so much to get
this all set up!!

All best,
Josh
