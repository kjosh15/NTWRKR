Eric Ellestad <https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ellestad/> was previously
the founder/CEO of Local Roots Farms in which I was an investor.
Unfortunately that company didn't work out but Eric's a very bright guy who
knows the space well.   For the past few years he's been the VP of R&D at 8=
0
Acres Farms <https://www.80acresfarms.com/>.  I reached out to let him know
what you're working on in Iceland and as it turns out he'll be there in
August on vacation.  He mentioned he's transitioning out of his current
role but not sure what he's doing next.  Let me know if you'd like an
introduction.
