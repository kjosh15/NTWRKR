Below are the =E2=80=98phone charges we incurred in Iceland. We upgraded ou=
r plan from 5 Gb hi speed data to 40 for an additional $20 for the month - =
and we used 0.88 Gb =F0=9F=99=81. The only charges were $0.25/minute for ca=
lls. My (-5616) calls are at top. Total cost for calls (I won=E2=80=99t upg=
rade data if we come back) was $7.75, so there appears to be no need to buy=
 an Icelandic SIM card - unless this is a deterrent for people wanting to c=
all us. <br>
<br>
As to pasta, it - IMO - is worth spending a bit more once in a while to tre=
at yourself. There is a difference and, as you=E2=80=99ve heard me say many=
 times, life=E2=80=99s a one-way street so be sure to enjoy the trip. <br>
