Who should I contact at Accenture about doing speeches/presentations off
the back of the podcast? I've done a lot of work translating complex
business and technical materials into easy-to-understand presentations for
the full stack of employees as well as external customers. Given all the
work they've done surfacing their most important insights I thought it'd be
interesting to discuss other ways to leverage it.

Who do you suggest I talk to at Accenture? Any recommendations are
appreciated!!

Many thanks,
Josh
