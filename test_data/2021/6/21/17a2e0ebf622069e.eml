My condolences to your family, Scott. I'm so sorry it's been such a
terrible year for you and yours.

Zero apologies necessary; thanks so much for the kind note, but feel free
to carry on juggling torches and loop back when you're able! I'll keep
sending you updates but please don't feel obligated to respond.

All best wishes,
Josh
