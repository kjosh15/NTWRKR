That's a great question, Josh, and I would be happy to clarify!



You were chosen by Marcel to be a participant at the conference this year. =
We ask that our delegates, even if they have valuable insights to help our =
other delegates, participate in the conference their first year.=20

There is a reason for this: we want you to be able to experience the magic =
of these new innovations and explore how to use new technologies to create =
scalable growth in your business.



There are also great networking events throughout the week where you can co=
nnect with other entrepreneurs and the innovators at Oxentia and build rela=
tionships.



Would you like to move forward and request your invitation to join our dele=
gation, Josh?
