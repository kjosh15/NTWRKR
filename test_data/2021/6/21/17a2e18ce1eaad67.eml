Fantastic news across the board!! Let me know if I can be of any help -
even if only to chat about the above! Part of me is delighted to hear you
have some serious offers on the table, and part of me is sad knowing that
you're about to become wildly unavailable when you dive into whatever is
next!!! ;D

Also, especially cool to hear what Lydia is up to. Curious if she's more
keen on the autonomous vehicle, or the AI elements?

Fingers crossed,
- J
