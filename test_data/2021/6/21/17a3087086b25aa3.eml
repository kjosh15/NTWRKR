That=E2=80=99s fantastic!! You do the coolest work!!

I appreciate this now more than ever; we=E2=80=99re living in Iceland now a=
nd being
outside it has really changed my view of the USA. I never considered myself
very patriotic, but being officially in charge of expressing our
=E2=80=9CAmerican-ness=E2=80=9D to my kids has forced me to articulate the =
values I find
really important, and the diversity peculiar to our country is a big one.
Thanks for doing this!

All best,
Josh
