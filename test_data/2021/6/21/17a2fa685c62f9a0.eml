Well that was an insane year and a half, and no sign of slowing down...

Firstly, I hope you and yours are doing well. It's been quite some time and
the pandemic touched everyone differently.

Secondly, the culture metricing platform I was working on when we last
spoke has exploded  and we're getting some serious attention from KPMG,
Accenture, Refinitive, etc. in using our platform to measure the "S" in
ESG.

I know this is a big part of Blackrock's strategy going forward - and it's
a huge part of ours. We're the only platform that I know of that has
actionable, longitudinal metrics on actual employee *behavior* (not
engagement) and we want to partner with entities that can help us develop
that element firstly (as opposed to being driven by specific client demands
in the short term.)

Let me know if it's worth a brief call regarding!!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If it helps validate, we have a couple dozen customers including 4
very large multinationals, 4 more very large multinationals in negotiation,
and 10 more in the pipeline. An HBR article about our use in solving for
D&I in one of the largest construction firms is due out next quarter and
Wharton is working with us on a white paper validating the platform.
There's a short video here <http://www.indigometrics.com>, and I've
attached our overview deck just in case!

                          Thanks so much! Reg. Iceland, my biggest tip is t=
o follow the weather - it changes continually and often, and it's worth goi=
ng to where it's good. Second tip is to get a car and head outside of the u=
sual tourist circles, as locals are very approachable when they're not bein=
g mobbed by visitors and will give you a good insight into the actual cultu=
re and country. Hit me with an idea of the kind of thing you like to do (hi=
king, museums, reindeer hunting, etc.) and I'll see if I can't be more spec=
ific!
