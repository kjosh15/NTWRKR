&gt;<br>
&gt; No problem at all =E2=80=93 I am so sorry it took so long and that it =
was a frustrating process!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We=E2=80=99re still working through the podcast format and scheduling.=
 We=E2=80=99ve narrowed down our ideas to two major concepts, which will be=
 presented to Accenture=E2=80=99s lead on brand marketing next week. All th=
e episodes will be tied back to their major whitepaper reports
 (which they call Iconic Thought Leadership), but will draw on insights fro=
m external sources/ examples and SMEs to help bring the stories to life. Th=
e first episode will be on Technology Vision, which is Accenture=E2=80=99s =
annual report outlining 5 major tech trends
 for the year. The report is in development and should go live next month. =
I imagine the episode would go live (ideally) sometime in early spring. =C2=
=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here&#39;s what we=E2=80=99re thinking (subject to final approval from=
 Accenture):<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2 or 3 person hosted podcast show (something like Pod Save America)<br=
>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We=E2=80=99re working on identifying who the other hosts will be, but =
would love to have you on board<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Would love for the hosts to be more involved in the content developmen=
t process =E2=80=93 ideating on the script, crafting interview questions an=
d conducting the interviews, going to different sites to help uncover the s=
tory (such as innovation hubs, if the story
 calls for it), join table reads, etc.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For now, could you share your blackout dates with us? For the remainde=
r of the month through April? For this month, we might need to do a table r=
ead to see the dynamic among the hosts =E2=80=93 so would love to make sure=
 you&#39;re avail to join that.<br>
