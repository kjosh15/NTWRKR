I spoke with my connection at Islandsstofa (Karl Gu=C3=B0mundsson) and got =
some
more insight into the opportunity space for Temasek and/or Tony.

Firstly, Temasek's head of public affairs, Steven Forshaw, has a good
relationship with the Icelandic ambassador in Singapore and is keen to do
something with Iceland - but nothing has been forthcoming yet. Karl would
love any help we might be able to provide; is it worth a brief call to see
what/if next steps might be on our end?

Secondly, Tony covered a lot of ground in terms of potential opportunities
here in Iceland, and Karl confirmed that they're all spot-on for the kinds
of investment Iceland is looking for. I'd be curious to get your take on
Tony's appetite and to hear if there is a way we can help support.

Let me know if a followup call is warranted!

All best,
Josh
