I haven't seen the styrene crack, but I suppose it's possible. The main
consideration is the flex required for the piece to fit in place, followed
by being waterproof. I don't know of anything else that can be similarly
cut and placed; does anyone else have any ideas?

As for grackles scaring off the crows... that's a new one on me!! Is there
a location that's less popular with grackles he can put it in?
