<div>
<p>Thanks for this, Mark. I think this could work as a good base. A few tho=
ughts that might help amortize the write-down on my end:=C2=A0
<u></u><u></u></p>
<div>
<p>=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>a) I&#39;d need this to be a 6-month commitment at least to make sense. =
Happy to set a three month rolling review and a six month rolling retainer =
if that makes everyone more comfortable. Normally I do one-year retainer ag=
reements.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>b) One of the areas I&#39;m looking to build professionally is in board =
seats. Is there an opportunity for that here? This could be worth a lot in =
terms of writing off the haircut.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>c) Similarly, I&#39;d prefer to cap it at three hours a week, of which t=
wo could initially be allocated for calls. In my experience, a fair amount =
of work gets moved to email as we work together, especially as deployment a=
nd testing begins.
 Additionally, setting this as a retainer means we can add hours as needed =
without committing you to more spend ongoing.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>d) Is there opportunity for equity at a later stage? If we&#39;re succes=
sful at growing USDG&#39;s innovation potential I expect to see many more c=
hances for growth in the future. Having a chance to earn-in on subsidiary p=
rojects or companies
 could be very useful.<u></u><u></u></p>
