Ellie,

Long time no speak! I wanted to catch up to discuss consulting/advising as
well as to revisit Indigometrics. We've been approached by KPMG and
Accenture, and are getting a lot of interest from other consultancies of
various stripes based on our recent work supporting ESG and Inclusion and
Diversity initiatives, and I wanted to compare notes. Let me know if you
have time for a brief call in the weeks ahead!

All best wishes,
Josh
