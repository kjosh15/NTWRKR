Just checking in to see if there's anything I can do to help. I've been
doing more presentations to leaders on Data, Privacy, and Churn, and am
getting increasingly useful questions around the role of AI and social
control across the spectrum. Curious to hear what you're getting asked,
where you're at in your journey, and if/how I could help! Let me know if a
brief call would be useful - I'm very happy to pitch in wherever some tech
insight might be useful!

All best,
Josh
