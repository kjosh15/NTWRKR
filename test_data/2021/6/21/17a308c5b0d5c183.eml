> Dad,

While you were here I mentioned there was an article with questions I
wanted to ask you. We ended up having too much fun to get to it, but I ran
across it again recently and figured I=E2=80=99d ask you to have a go.

This isn=E2=80=99t homework, but I realized these were all questions I=E2=
=80=99d be curious
to get your response to, so please feel free to send me your thoughts on
however many you=E2=80=99re willing to share - if any!!

Lots of love,
Josh
