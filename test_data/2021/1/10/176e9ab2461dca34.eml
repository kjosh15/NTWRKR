Hey Josh,

I don't have Machine Vision experience... I don't know how to code, but my
background is Industrial Design. I'm basing the whole concept on open
source software shown in this video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DCgxsv1riJhI>. My first step is to see ho=
w
easy the software is to use and how accurate it is. I think if we had an
MVP that could identify needles and run on a smartphone the rest would come
together pretty quickly. I can 3D print camera mounts and what not needed
to hold the phone in place. There would need to be some mechanical
engineering for the coin dispenser too. I have a friend that knows how to
weld and could probably modify an existing dumpster or steel box.

I'm talking to a friend I used to work with tonight who worked at Microsoft
for almost a decade. I think she'll have a network of devs that could
potentially be tapped. I feel like there's enough talent in Seattle and
beyond (like yourself) to make this a reality.

I was going to ask.. Do you have an idea of how much change can be captured
by the crows?  I'd assume the more densely populated the area the more
potential for the crows to find change.

Thanks!
