Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support.  I hope to assist you with your inquiry.

The domains will become expired if they are not paid for and the entire (mt) Media Temple account will become suspended if an overdue payment is not made in 10 days of the charge.

Once the domains have been paid, we can separate out services into their own account.

In order to separate a service to its own account with new owner information, please provide the following information in a new support request, https://ac.mediatemple.net/support/getsupport.mt : 

Service(s) you wish to move:
Company Name: 
Owner's Name: 
Billing Address: 
Email: 
Phone: 

When separating domain registrations into their own account, the only things that will change are the Account Center login and the billing information for that service. Please note as well that the email address that you list will be the primary email for the new account, and the new account's login information will be sent to that address. Once we have separated the services, the new owner will receive their new Account Center login information and will need to update the credit card billing information.

If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this support request, or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for continuing to use (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Ryan H.
