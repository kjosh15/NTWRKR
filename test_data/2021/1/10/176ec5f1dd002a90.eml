There's definitely something there, but the real crux of it is the machine
vision. Finding something that can reliably recognize needles under the
variety of conditions a box like this would present would need to be proven
first.

The other concern is if/when birds get poked in the mouth by said needles.
Probably better than starving, but there will be folks who will definitely
be concerned about this.

Overall I'd say the box design should be able to support what you're trying
to do if you can find someone with the vision expertise - let me know what
your contact at microsoft says!

As for the total amount of change crows could capture, I have no idea!!
There are several hobbyists out there who have video of trained crows, but
we're trying to create verified results from a replicable process so we can
start optimizing it to fit to a variety of environments. I wouldn't stake
your retirement on it, though. ;)

Keep me posted,
Josh
