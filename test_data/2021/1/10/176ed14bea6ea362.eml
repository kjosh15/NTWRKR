Conversation is never fruitless if there remains a chance to repair. I, too,=
 have learned a lot about where we are. Maybe I am not as shocked because I m=
ake it a point to read/listen to/watch different news channels, including Eu=
ropean ones - and yes, I think there=E2=80=99s a lot to be said for curated n=
ews sources, despite what I said earlier about some being inaccurate. That i=
s a big part of the problem.=20

It=E2=80=99s been useful for me to have to maintain some semblance of a rela=
tionship with extreme right relatives, and to engage in person from time to t=
ime, as we must because we focus on what=E2=80=99s more important - love of g=
randparents. If we surround ourselves with like-minded people only, and cons=
ume news we only agree with, we live in an echo chamber.=20

Yes, I do agree that we are living in different realities but I don=E2=80=99=
t want to go so far as to call them =E2=80=9Cseparate=E2=80=9D if there is a=
 chance of holding onto to the truths that bind us - our love of country and=
 for most of us, desire for peace. Right now I think it=E2=80=99s important t=
o hold onto that because it may be all we have in common. Dan=E2=80=99s anal=
ogy to marriage counseling is very apt here. If one party walks away, it=E2=80=
=99s over.

You don=E2=80=99t have to respond if you don=E2=80=99t want to. But that doe=
sn=E2=80=99t mean that the conversation should end. I understand your frustr=
ation. =46rom whatever your sources, you have accepted a set of facts that y=
ou believe to be true. Others have chosen to believe another version. John i=
s right =E2=80=94 history will provide the jury but there will always be fri=
nge believers out there.=20

For example, here=E2=80=99s something as radical as what we are seeing today=
:  when I was in seventh grade, I remember telling a couple of my classmates=
 that my mother had an uncle who had returned from World War II with photogr=
aphs of bodies piled on top of one another from starvation in the concentrat=
ion camps. Our English teacher turned on me and yelled at the top of her lun=
gs, =E2=80=9CTHAT never happened!=E2=80=9C  My mother said that I was so emb=
arrassed by it, that I was quiet for two days. I questioned my mother=E2=80=99=
s accounting of her memory but of course it was true. And it says a lot abou=
t my English teacher.=20

We cannot disengage from the conversation. That=E2=80=99s how wars start. Wh=
ile there are some who are ready, we must not facilitate their heinous effor=
ts by disengaging. For once in my life, I am glad that I grew up surrounded b=
y mid 19th century household artifacts to remind me of how fragile our union=
 was - and probably is again. We need to find our way back.=20

>>>>>> The answer to those questions are President Trump's diehard supporter=
s, heavily influenced by the Tea Party, pro-Confederate, and QAnon movements=
--along with a few Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Many carried flags and wore c=
lothing representing these movements, and dozens gave interviews to journali=
sts inside and outside the Capitol to that effect. Many of them had just com=
e from the President's speech, where the President repeated disproven lies a=
bout the election, attacked disloyal Republican lawmakers and his own Vice P=
resident, attacked the media as enemies of the people, and told the group to=
 walk to the Capitol. When asked by reporters, the insurrectionists at and i=
nside the Capitol repeated the same misinformation and attacks from the Pres=
ident. Reporters inside the Capitol described that after a 2:24pm Trump twee=
t about Vice President Pence not having the courage to do "what should have b=
een done", insurrectionists inside the Capitol began chanting "Where's Mike P=
ence?" and reporters have indicated that they overheard talk of executing hi=
m. The most commonly shared photo from the insurrection, of Jake Angeli, is o=
f a (now arrested) man who refers to himself on social media as "The QAnon S=
haman," and has expounded on QAnon conspiracy theories online since the atta=
ck. There was plenty of online chatter, which I saw myself, about right-wing=
 plans to "occupy the Capitol" in order to "stop the steal" on 6 January. Th=
e post-insurrection arrests so far have all been of pro-Trump figures associ=
ated with right-wing movements, and the FBI has stated there is no evidence o=
f involvement by left-wing movements like Antifa. The same right-wing groups=
 accosted Lindsey Graham at DCA last night requiring him to travel with a se=
curity detail, and the same thing happened to Mitt Romney on a flight on Mon=
day, shouting accusations about Romney's association with Burisma, of all th=
ings. Bombs, guns, flexcuff-style zipties, were found on the insurrectionist=
s and recovered from the Capitol grounds, DNC headquarters, and RNC headquar=
ters. Journalists were attacked. The death toll stands at five inside or on t=

 I make it a point to read/listen to/watch different news channels, includin=

s been useful for me to have to maintain some semblance of a relationship wi=
th extreme right relatives, and to engage in person from time to time, as we=
 must because we focus on what=E2=80=99s more important - love of grandparen=
ts. If we surround ourselves with like-minded people only, and consume news w=

 chance of holding onto to the truths that bind us - our love of country and=
 for most of us, desire for peace. Right now I think it=E2=80=99s important t=

 don=E2=80=99t want to. But that doesn=E2=80=99t mean that the conversation s=
hould end. I understand your frustration. =46rom whatever your sources, you h=
ave accepted a set of facts that you believe to be true. Others have chosen t=
o believe another version. John is right =E2=80=94 history will provide the j=
ury but there will always be fringe believers out there.&nbsp;</div><div><br=
></div><div>For example, here=E2=80=99s something as radical as what we are s=
eeing today: &nbsp;when I was in seventh grade, I remember telling a couple o=
f my classmates that my mother had an uncle who had returned from World War I=
I with photographs of bodies piled on top of one another from starvation in t=
he concentration camps. Our English teacher turned on me and yelled at the t=
op of her lungs, =E2=80=9CTHAT never happened!=E2=80=9C &nbsp;My mother said=
 that I was so embarrassed by it, that I was quiet for two days. I questione=
d my mother=E2=80=99s accounting of her memory but of course it was true. An=
d it says a lot about my English teacher.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We c=
annot disengage from the conversation. That=E2=80=99s how wars start. While t=
here are some who are ready, we must not facilitate their heinous efforts by=
 disengaging. For once in my life, I am glad that I grew up surrounded by mi=
d 19th century household artifacts to remind me of how fragile our union was=
 - and probably is again. We need to find our way back.&nbsp;</div><div><br>=

evolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divorced f=
rom reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. Th=
ey and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and politici=
ans who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel a=
t, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the government, an=
d they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. </div><div><b=
r></div><div>Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a=
 laughing stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest o=
f our history. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind y=
ourself that <b>the United States Government lost control of the Capitol bui=
lding to an extremist group for several hours</b>, resulting in at least fiv=
e deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representativ=
es, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congress=
. Let's not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should be no e=
xcuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And yet, the di=
sinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on disproven nar=
ratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers are now try=
ing to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAnon cult memb=
ers responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures are correcti=
ng them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would n=
ot allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for the i=
nsurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforcement a=
nd frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that's making the rounds in ri=
ght-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the lates=
t emergent narrative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at=
 all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually storm=
ed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood=
.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President's video condemning the=
 insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is still=
 urging them on.

To me, it's bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any othe=
r conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, "leaders" of such m=
ilieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly encouraging others=
 to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on t=
heir own initiative. After all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tightl=
y-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely virtual c=
ommunities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculia=
r political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially "dangerous," one=
 could conceivably justify placing millions of people under surveillance. No=
t for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don't think any of us would like to liv=
e in such a society, i.e., where "thought crimes" alone were punished.</div>=

<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a gam=
e designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interested, for some time, in h=
ow QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; The first question to answ=
er is whether it is appropriate and lawful
 for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAnon=
 and/or members of QAnon.<br>
<br>
Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain criminal=
 intelligence information concerning a group only if there is reasonable sus=
picion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activity a=
nd the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshall=
 not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the politic=
al, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individual=
 or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relates=
 to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that the s=
ubject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or activ=
ity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informati=
on exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforceme=
nt or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a bas=
is to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable c=
riminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if larg=
e numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is n=
ot sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.&nbsp; =
For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furth=
erance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertaken=
 when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimina=
l intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of groups=
 such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (=
i.e. is it a club or gang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Ins=
ane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally predic=
ated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are s=
everal examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes of=
 violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and ideol=
ogy.&nbsp; The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find wi=
th groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gan=
gs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it woul=
d be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. &nbsp; <br=
>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence in=
 support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon had t=
he criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. &nbsp;=
 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was and is the intent of those who originally o=
rganized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial in=
terest in finding out?<br>
<br>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be safe,</div>
