Heather Cox Richardson is life goals.

Shout outs to everyone who has a foot in each version of reality. I'm
from Mississippi and then lived in New York before DC... it's
exhausting. I wish there was a manual for this. I'm currently
compiling a list of helpful resources if anyone wants to share any
material on navigating this divide.

I'm seeing more people with a root emotion of fear, which manifests as
anger. This leads to their increased consumption of conspiracy
theories (NYT Rabbit Hole is a great podcast illustrating this), and
their constant need for self validation and playing the victim. With
media capitalizing on the anger, they had to create the "other", which
quickly spirals into where we are today.

My life goal is trying to humanize the other, with varying levels of
success. Right now, after wednesday, I am speechless though, as the
mental gymnastics are flying above my previously successful
techniques. I wish there was a 12 step recovery program or
intervention manual for getting people out of Qanon BS, but step 1 is
admitting you have a problem.

Charli
