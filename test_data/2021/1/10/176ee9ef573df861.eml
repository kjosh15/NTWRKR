Josh -

It's been quite a while, I hope you've been well and had a nice start to
the new year. Thanks for sharing IndigoMetrics with us. I got pretty behind
last week (maybe too many distractions :-(

Give me a chance to discuss your materials internally with my team and I'll
revert back soon.

Best,
