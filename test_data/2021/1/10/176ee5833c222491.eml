Everyone,=20

My last email appears to call out Dustin exclusively. It is not my intent to=
 pick on anyone or coddle others.=20

I addressed only disengagement from conversation, but I did not point out ho=
w parts of the thread on both sides had really deteriorated into bullying an=
d name calling. I intentionally did not take that on, but perhaps I should h=
ave - frankly I thought that bringing us back to center might be enough. Any=
way folks, it=E2=80=99s not my job to maintain the group as a place where an=
ything can be said as long as it=E2=80=99s said politely, it=E2=80=99s every=
one=E2=80=99s job. If you don=E2=80=99t like someone=E2=80=99s behavior, ple=
ase don=E2=80=99t wait for me to deliver the spanking. You=E2=80=99re all ve=
ry capable of keeping each other in check.=20
=20
Some participants feel that I did an inadequate job in my last email and I a=
m going to apologize for that. No one called out the bully /bullies, so here=
 it is: please bear in mind that devolving into an ugly scrap gets us nowher=
e.  I think the multiple instances where this thread went south are clear, a=
lthough maybe not clear to those who departed from an adult and civil discus=
sion.

This thread is ours to use as we please, but I think we will all enjoy it mo=
re when positions are offered with respect for one another. We always have s=
aid that there are no sacred cows at SHARP, and that applies to us too. No o=
ne here is sacred because he or she yells the loudest, is famous, or the hig=
hest ranking - no one including former program managers and leads. Please ju=
st be nice. This is entirely up to you, but should you wish to cite referenc=
e material, cite credible material so that your points will be considered wi=
th the seriousness they deserve.  If you make statements that are patently u=
ntrue, expect to be confronted in a professional way.

Speaking of which, some falsehoods were proclaimed =E2=80=94 but few engaged=
 the poster(s) because people don=E2=80=99t want to engage with those who de=
monstrate their inability to be reasonable by they way they attack another p=
oster. I=E2=80=99m not taking sides here. However, I am trying to make sure e=
veryone feels safe and welcome. It goes without saying that these are very t=
rying times for all of us. Of course tempers are running high, but take a br=
eath and remember that at the end of the day, we don=E2=80=99t want the Russ=
ians to win.=20

Finally, while I didn=E2=80=99t agree with Dustin=E2=80=99s desire to diseng=
age from the conversation, I will say that every time he contributed, he did=
 so without resorting to bad behavior, and from that we can all learn.=20

graphs of bodies piled on top of one another from starvation in the concentr=
ation camps. Our English teacher turned on me and yelled at the top of her l=
ungs, =E2=80=9CTHAT never happened!=E2=80=9C  My mother said that I was so e=
mbarrassed by it, that I was quiet for two days. I questioned my mother=E2=80=
=99s accounting of her memory but of course it was true. And it says a lot a=
bout my English teacher.=20
>=20
> We cannot disengage from the conversation. That=E2=80=99s how wars start. W=
hile there are some who are ready, we must not facilitate their heinous effo=

>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>> The answer to those questions are President Trump's diehard supporte=
rs, heavily influenced by the Tea Party, pro-Confederate, and QAnon movement=
s--along with a few Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Many carried flags and wore=
 clothing representing these movements, and dozens gave interviews to journa=
lists inside and outside the Capitol to that effect. Many of them had just c=
ome from the President's speech, where the President repeated disproven lies=
 about the election, attacked disloyal Republican lawmakers and his own Vice=
 President, attacked the media as enemies of the people, and told the group t=
o walk to the Capitol. When asked by reporters, the insurrectionists at and i=
nside the Capitol repeated the same misinformation and attacks from the Pres=
ident. Reporters inside the Capitol described that after a 2:24pm Trump twee=
t about Vice President Pence not having the courage to do "what should have b=
een done", insurrectionists inside the Capitol began chanting "Where's Mike P=
ence?" and reporters have indicated that they overheard talk of executing hi=
m. The most commonly shared photo from the insurrection, of Jake Angeli, is o=
f a (now arrested) man who refers to himself on social media as "The QAnon S=
haman," and has expounded on QAnon conspiracy theories online since the atta=
ck. There was plenty of online chatter, which I saw myself, about right-wing=
 plans to "occupy the Capitol" in order to "stop the steal" on 6 January. Th=
e post-insurrection arrests so far have all been of pro-Trump figures associ=
ated with right-wing movements, and the FBI has stated there is no evidence o=
f involvement by left-wing movements like Antifa. The same right-wing groups=
 accosted Lindsey Graham at DCA last night requiring him to travel with a se=
curity detail, and the same thing happened to Mitt Romney on a flight on Mon=
day, shouting accusations about Romney's association with Burisma, of all th=

 such information directly relates to criminal conduct or activity and there=
 is reasonable suspicion that the subject of the information is or may be in=

 known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when information exi=

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The fact that members of a group engage in criminal acti=
vities, even if large numbers or a majority of group members engage in crimi=
nal activities, is not sufficient to establish criminal predication for the g=
roup itself.  For the group to be criminally predicated, members must be eng=
aging in crime at the direction of the group or in furtherance of the group=E2=
=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This all matters to law enforcement because this analysi=

nd maintain criminal intelligence information on or initiate a criminal inve=
stigation of groups such as the Anonymous Hacker Collective, the World Churc=
h of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (i.e. is it a club or gang).=
  The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Insane Clown Posse when it determin=
ed that the Juggalos are a criminally predicated group.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to=
 me that there are several examples of members engaging in criminal activity=
 including crimes of violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, o=
bjectives, and ideology.  The next question would be whether there are clear=
 organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find with groups, such a=
s the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gangs, or not as is y=
ou find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it would be necessary to f=
orensically determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are.=

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>=20
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once identified, the next investigative step would be to=
 collect evidence in support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and lea=

nyone or coddle others.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I addressed only dise=
ngagement from conversation, but I did not point out how parts of the thread=
 on both sides had really deteriorated into bullying and name calling. I int=
entionally did not take that on, but perhaps I should have - frankly I thoug=
ht that bringing us back to center might be enough. Anyway folks, it=E2=80=99=
s not my job to maintain the group as a place where anything can be said as l=

ch other in check.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Some participants feel t=
hat I did an inadequate job in my last email and I am going to apologize for=
 that. No one called out the bully /bullies, so here it is: please bear in m=
ind that devolving into an ugly scrap gets us nowhere. &nbsp;I think the mul=
tiple instances where this thread went south are clear, although maybe not c=
lear to those who departed from an adult and civil discussion.</div><div><br=
></div><div>This thread is ours to use as we please, but I think we will all=
 enjoy it more when positions are offered with respect for one another. We a=
lways have said that there are no sacred cows at SHARP, and that applies to u=
s too. No one here is sacred because he or she yells the loudest, is famous,=
 or the highest ranking - no one including former program managers and leads=
. Please just be nice. This is entirely up to you, but should you wish to ci=
te reference material, cite credible material so that your points will be co=
nsidered with the seriousness they deserve. &nbsp;If you make statements tha=
t are patently untrue, expect to be confronted in a professional way.</div><=
div><br></div><div>Speaking of which, some falsehoods were proclaimed =E2=80=
=94 but few engaged the poster(s) because people don=E2=80=99t want to engag=
e with those who demonstrate their inability to be reasonable by they way th=
ey attack another poster. I=E2=80=99m not taking sides here. However, I am t=
rying to make sure everyone feels safe and welcome. It goes without saying t=
hat these are very trying times for all of us. Of course tempers are running=
 high, but take a breath and remember that at the end of the day, we don=E2=80=
=99t want the Russians to win.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, while=
 I didn=E2=80=99t agree with Dustin=E2=80=99s desire to disengage from the c=
onversation, I will say that every time he contributed, he did so without re=
sorting to bad behavior, and from that we can all learn.&nbsp;<div dir=3D"lt=

ogy of sound moving under water. Sound moves faster in a water medium, but b=
ecause of that, it reaches your ears so fast, you cannot discern&nbsp;a soun=
d source or direction. The increased speed of sound propagation underwater&n=
bsp;defeats our learned ear stereo ability to parse and locate the direction=
 and amplitude of sound, as we easily do in the slower moving medium of air.=
 Sound underwater thus&nbsp;becomes amplified, yet muddled. The internet has=
&nbsp;amplified and multiplied voices, outliers, and disinformation into a m=
uddle roar, competing for your attention, with little ability to parse, disc=
ern, or actually verify true sources, direction, or intent.</li><li>Thus, si=
gnificant&nbsp;disinformation exists on both sides of the political&nbsp;spe=
ctrum. Without question, 'reality decay' exists on both sides of the aisle.<=
/li><li>Antifa riots and misinformation are equally as dangerous. They and o=
ther groups are not any more sacrosanct or informed than QAnon. Remember, a "=
mob's IQ" is less than the average&nbsp;IQ in the mob. As in, very low. This=
 is on both sides to fix.</li><li>Election fraud is a 'narrative' yes, one o=
ut there since 1960, and even before, with varying levels of authenticity or=
 concern. There are real solutions to controlling voter fraud (and plugging a=
ny system 'seams' where a narrative might emerge), to make sure most America=
ns are confident in the fairness and security of the system they are a part o=
f. (1 citizen, 1 vote.) We need to fully secure, not just the system, but mo=
st importantly, the integrity, perception, respect, and vital citizen confid=
ence in the system.&nbsp;</li><li>History will be the judge. Most media poli=
tical&nbsp;commentary right now sounds a lot like talking head sports commen=
tators who fill time, acting like they are in the know, when their&nbsp;subj=
ective bias is clearly seen, and a game's real outcome has so many complex, e=
mergent variables, that no one can be certain, or even not much better than '=
coin flip average' about the real fulcrums and true results.</li><li>I feel w=
e are in the rushing rapids of history&nbsp;right now (what a crazy year!),&=
nbsp;far from either bank. Old assumptions about economics and social system=
s are morphing in front of our&nbsp;eyes under this 'new&nbsp;normal.' The e=
normous weight and momentum of the rushing 'water' is pushing against us har=
d. Even as we try to stand our ground, it carries us downstream to parts unk=
nown, around unseen bends in the river. It has happened before in history, o=
f course. I think it's high time we work together to build a bridge between b=
oth banks...for everyone's sake...before we accidentally reach any Class VI r=

cussion takes on a more sinister character since Wednesday's events. Promine=
nt among the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday a few blo=
cks from where I live were open followers of the QAnon alternative reality g=
ame/set of conspiracy theories/political movement. Notable among reports fro=
m the journalists inside the Capitol was the casual attitude the insurrectio=
nists had to breaking Federal law; some even said they didn't appear to real=
ize what they were doing was illegal or outrageous even as they beat and cha=
sed the building's defenders.=20
Many did not seem to understand the distinction between the Capitol being "t=
he people's house" and the Capitol and everything in it actually belonging t=
o them. Video has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capitol police of=
ficer up the stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man who stood on the H=
ouse Dais and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as "the QAnon Shaman."

One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incense=
d that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, she w=
as only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to start a r=
evolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divorced f=
rom reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. Th=
ey and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and politici=
ans who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel a=
t, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the government, an=
d they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. </div><div><b=
r></div><div>Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a=
 laughing stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest o=
f our history. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind y=
ourself that <b>the United States Government lost control of the Capitol bui=
lding to an extremist group for several hours</b>, resulting in at least fiv=
e deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representativ=
es, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congress=
. Let's not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should be no e=
xcuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And yet, the di=
sinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on disproven nar=
ratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers are now try=
ing to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAnon cult memb=
ers responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures are correcti=
ng them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would n=
ot allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for the i=
nsurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforcement a=
nd frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that's making the rounds in ri=
ght-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the lates=
t emergent narrative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at=
 all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually storm=
ed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood=
.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President's video condemning the=
 insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is still=
 urging them on.

To me, it's bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any othe=
r conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, "leaders" of such m=
ilieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly encouraging others=
 to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on t=
heir own initiative. After all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tightl=
y-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely virtual c=
ommunities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculia=
r political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially "dangerous," one=
 could conceivably justify placing millions of people under surveillance. No=
t for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don't think any of us would like to liv=
e in such a society, i.e., where "thought crimes" alone were punished.</div>=

<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a gam=
e designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interested, for some time, in h=
ow QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; The first question to answ=
er is whether it is appropriate and lawful
 for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAnon=
 and/or members of QAnon.<br>
<br>
Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain criminal=
 intelligence information concerning a group only if there is reasonable sus=
picion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activity a=
nd the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshall=
 not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the politic=
al, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individual=
 or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relates=
 to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that the s=
ubject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or activ=
ity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informati=
on exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforceme=
nt or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a bas=
is to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable c=
riminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if larg=
e numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is n=
ot sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.&nbsp; =
For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furth=
erance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertaken=
 when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimina=
l intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of groups=
 such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (=
i.e. is it a club or gang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Ins=
ane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally predic=
ated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are s=
everal examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes of=
 violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and ideol=
ogy.&nbsp; The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find wi=
th groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gan=
gs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it woul=
d be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. &nbsp; <br=
>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence in=
 support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon had t=
he criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. &nbsp;=
 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was and is the intent of those who originally o=
rganized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial in=
terest in finding out?<br>
<br>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be safe,</div>
