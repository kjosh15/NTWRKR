      I'm completely puzzled about the complacency I'm seeing after the US =
Government was directly attacked by a mob inside the citadel of our democra=
cy. This was an unprecedented domestic intelligence and law enforcement fai=
lure, it briefly brought the existential status of our democracy into quest=
ion for the first time since the Civil War, and nothing about its causes ha=
s been resolved. The US Government lost control of the Capitol building and=
 the Executive Branch at first seemed unwilling to help take it back.

      I doubt Lincoln was talking publicly about healing three days after F=
ort Sumter, and I don't think Bavaria was interested in it after the Beer H=
all Putsch. That's where we are right now, and the threat of further violen=
ce is not over. There is every indication that these groups are interested =
in more violence, and this attack is a portend of things to come. You don't=
 find a way to heal when the killer is still inside your house.

       Totally agree with the point, Vint. There was a lot of misinformatio=

 that they were there to start a revolution. Pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails,=
 and firearms including long guns were recovered from the Capitol grounds.

                               <li>Well said, Margaret.&nbsp;+100</li>
                               <li>The speed&nbsp;of information&nbsp;in to=
day's crazy web connected world is overwhelming&nbsp;many citizens' ability=
 to parse and understand its real source and intent.&nbsp; I use the analog=
y of sound moving under water. Sound moves faster in a water medium, but be=
cause of that, it reaches your ears so fast, you cannot discern&nbsp;a soun=
d source or direction. The increased speed of sound propagation underwater&=
nbsp;defeats our learned ear stereo ability to parse and locate the directi=
on and amplitude of sound, as we easily do in the slower moving medium of a=
ir. Sound underwater thus&nbsp;becomes amplified, yet muddled. The internet=
 has&nbsp;amplified and multiplied voices, outliers, and disinformation int=
o a muddle roar, competing for your attention, with little ability to parse=
, discern, or actually verify true sources, direction, or intent.</li>
                               <li>Thus, significant&nbsp;disinformation ex=
ists on both sides of the political&nbsp;spectrum. Without question, 'reali=
ty decay' exists on both sides of the aisle.</li>
                               <li>Antifa riots and misinformation are equa=
lly as dangerous. They and other groups are not any more sacrosanct or info=
rmed than QAnon. Remember, a "mob's IQ" is less than the average&nbsp;IQ in=
 the mob. As in, very low. This is on both sides to fix.</li>
                               <li>Election fraud is a 'narrative' yes, one=
 out there since 1960, and even before, with varying levels of authenticity=
 or concern. There are real solutions to controlling voter fraud (and plugg=
ing any system 'seams' where a narrative might emerge), to make sure most A=
mericans are confident in the fairness and security of the system they are =
a part of. (1 citizen, 1 vote.) We need to fully secure, not just the syste=
m, but most importantly, the integrity, perception, respect, and vital citi=
zen confidence in the system.&nbsp;</li>
                               <li>History will be the judge. Most media po=
litical&nbsp;commentary right now sounds a lot like talking head sports com=
mentators who fill time, acting like they are in the know, when their&nbsp;=
subjective bias is clearly seen, and a game's real outcome has so many comp=
lex, emergent variables, that no one can be certain, or even not much bette=
r than 'coin flip average' about the real fulcrums and true results.</li>
                               <li>I feel we are in the rushing rapids of h=
istory&nbsp;right now (what a crazy year!),&nbsp;far from either bank. Old =
assumptions about economics and social systems are morphing in front of our=
&nbsp;eyes under this 'new&nbsp;normal.' The enormous weight and momentum o=
f the rushing 'water' is pushing against us hard. Even as we try to stand o=
ur ground, it carries us downstream to parts unknown, around unseen bends i=
n the river. It has happened before in history, of course. I think it's hig=
h time we work together to build a bridge between both banks...for everyone=
's sake...before we accidentally reach any Class VI rapids of no&nbsp;retur=
n.</li>

                                 This recent discussion takes on a more sin=
ister character since Wednesday's events. Prominent among the insurrectioni=
sts who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday a few blocks from where I live wer=
e open followers of the QAnon alternative reality game/set of conspiracy th=
eories/political movement. Notable among reports from the journalists insid=
e the Capitol was the casual attitude the insurrectionists had to breaking =
Federal law; some even said they didn't appear to realize what they were do=
ing was illegal or outrageous even as they beat and chased the building's d=
efenders. Many did not seem to understand the distinction between the Capit=
ol being "the people's house" and the Capitol and everything in it actually=
 belonging to them. Video has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capi=
tol police officer up the stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man who =
stood on the House Dais and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as "the QAn=
on Shaman." One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprise=
d and incensed that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her o=
wn words, she was only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken wi=
ndow to start a revolution.=20

                                 These people are utterly divorced from rea=
lity and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. They and=
 their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and politicians w=
ho have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel at, =
they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the government, and =
they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end.=20

ize these events, remind yourself that=20
                                 <b>the United States Government lost contr=
ol of the Capitol building to an extremist group for several hours</b>, res=
ulting in at least five deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property,=
 forcing the evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of=
 Representatives, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint sess=
ion of Congress. Let's not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and the=
re should be no excuse for those who enabled it.

                                 And yet, the disinformation persists. Beyo=
nd just the continued insistence on disproven narratives about a fraudulent=
 Presidential election, some lawmakers are now trying to claim that the Cap=
itol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAnon cult members responsible for the =
insurrection and identified in pictures are correcting them and bragging ab=
out what they did on social media. Whatever political bias you may think te=
chnology firms may have, we would not allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. Th=
at any of those responsible for the insurrection are still free now is an i=
ncredible failure of law enforcement and frankly, of national security.=20

                                 I include a picture that's making the roun=
ds in right-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating =
the latest emergent narrative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually=
 happen at all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one act=
ually stormed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere =
in Hollywood. QAnon followers are also convinced that the President's video=
 condemning the insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real Pr=
esident is still urging them on.=20

                                      To me, it's bizarre to even be talkin=
g about LE monitoring QAnon or any other conspiratorial intellectual milieu=
s. Unless, of course, "leaders" of such milieus - assuming there actually a=
re any - are explicitly encouraging others to engage in violence or unless =
particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on =
their own initiative. After all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tigh=
tly-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely virtu=
al communities of people who share certain eccentric beliefs. If every mili=
eu that believed in certain peculiar political conspiracy theories was rega=
rded as potentially "dangerous," one could conceivably justify placing mill=
ions of people under surveillance. Not for what they actually do, but merel=
y for what they believe. I don't think any of us would like to live in such=
 a society, i.e., where "thought crimes" alone were punished.

                                      Reading the analysis of QAnon from th=
e perspective of a game designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interes=
ted, for some time, in how QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; T=
he first question to answer is whether it is appropriate and lawful for dom=
estic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAnon and/or=
 members of QAnon.
                                      <br>=20
                                      <br> Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law e=
nforcement can collect and maintain criminal intelligence information conce=
rning a group only if there is reasonable suspicion that the group =E2=80=
=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activity and the information is relev=
ant to that criminal conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enfor=
cement =E2=80=9Cshall not collect or maintain criminal intelligence informa=
tion about the political, religious or social views, associations, or activ=
ities of any individual or any group, association, corporation, business, p=
artnership, or other organization unless such information directly relates =
to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that the =
subject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or act=
ivity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reasonable suspicion (also known as a criminal predic=
ate) =E2=80=9Cis established when information exists which establishes suff=
icient facts to give a trained law enforcement or criminal investigative ag=
ency officer, investigator, or employee a basis to believe that there is a =
reasonable possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a =
definable criminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D
                                      <br>=20
                                      <br> The fact that members of a group=
 engage in criminal activities, even if large numbers or a majority of grou=
p members engage in criminal activities, is not sufficient to establish cri=
minal predication for the group itself.&nbsp; For the group to be criminall=
y predicated, members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the gro=
up or in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologie=
s.
                                      <br>=20
                                      <br> This all matters to law enforcem=
ent because this analysis must be undertaken when determining if it is prop=
er and lawful to collect and maintain criminal intelligence information on =
or initiate a criminal investigation of groups such as the Anonymous Hacker=
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club=
 (i.e. is it a club or gang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the =
Insane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally pr=
edicated group.
                                      <br>=20
                                      <br> As I look at media reporting of =
QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are several examples of members enga=
ging in criminal activity including crimes of violence in furtherance of th=
e group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and ideology.&nbsp; The next question =
would be whether there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group su=
ch as you find with groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and out=
law motorcycle gangs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Colle=
ctive. Then it would be necessary to forensically determine who those organ=
izer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. &nbsp;=20

                                      <br> Once identified, the next invest=
igative step would be to collect evidence in support of probable cause that=
 the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon had the criminal intent for those =
crimes or other planned crimes to occur. &nbsp; At this point it seems to a=
ll boil down to:

                                      <br> 1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was=
 and is the intent of those who originally organized QAnon and currently le=
ad QAnon if such exist?
