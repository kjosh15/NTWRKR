me on anyone else.

I am so grateful for the boys schooling, not just for me but for their own
sanity. It's been rough in NYC and elsewhere in the US. Life here has its
own challenges, school was cancelled Friday because of avalanche danger and
school culture is more brutal than would be tolerated in the lovely and
socially conscious Ella Baker. Overall though we have more normalcy.
