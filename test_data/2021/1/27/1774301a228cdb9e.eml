Josh,

Thank you for contacting Media Temple!

I'm so sorry, but I was able to download the 7.7 MB file in under 3 seconds using the link you provided, so there may be a networking issue somewhere between your location and the server. Can you please run a traceroute command to these addresses, then paste the results in a reply to this Support Request? 

indigometrics.com
64.13.192.163

Here is a guide on traceroutes:

Using the traceroute command
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/all/204643870/using-the-traceroute-command

This should give us a better idea if there is a network bottleneck somewhere, and help track down the specific problem.

Again, my apologies that I'm not able to reproduce the downloading issue, and please let us know if you have any questions!

For further assistance, please contact us by replying to this support request through the Media Temple Account Center, or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you!

Best regards,

Eain B.
