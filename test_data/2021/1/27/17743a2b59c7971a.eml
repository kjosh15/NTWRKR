This is fantastic news. That=E2=80=99s a huge get. Nice work, Josh.

It=E2=80=99s like chess, using strategy to set ourselves up in such a =
way whereby the network is simply unable to say no. Just takes time.

Does Monday afternoon at 2pm UTC work for a brainstorm and Tuesday for =
our call with Jaron?

Here are the points we should have considered and be prepared to answer =
ahead of our brainstorm:
What is Jaron's want? Meaning, what do we think he wants next for his =
profession? Can we align ourselves to fit within that to solidify his =
involvement?
Do we both have the elevator pitch down? Is the format of the show =
clear? Can we recite it easily?
What shows or films have the look of what we=E2=80=99re aiming for?
If we took on a studio partner, who would we want it to be?=20
What network or streaming channel has content that is the most similar =
to what we=E2=80=99re proposing?
We will soon need a more robust, 15-page deck. How shall we begin =
navigating that?
Do we want to take on a producer to help kick this into motion, as =
we=E2=80=99re both juggling so much already?
We should legally register this treatment because it=E2=80=99s such a =
unique idea.
Thanks much,
M
