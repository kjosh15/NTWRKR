Thanks! I applied for the Director of Strategic Partnerships role by way of
starting the discussion, and asked to connect to the team regardless. If
you can push them in that direction I'd love to chat! Very much obliged.

Other than that how the heck are you all? Austin seems to be blowing up; is
that a net positive beyond your real estate pricing? Keep us in mind in
case you want an arctic adventure in future - at the moment we can walk out
our second floor windows and down the snowdrifts...

All best,
Josh
