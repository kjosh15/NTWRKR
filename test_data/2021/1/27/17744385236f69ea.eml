Chris,

Spoke to a prof at Reykjavik University (scheduled before the holidays) and
he suggested he could run the platform with his Master's of Project
Management students (about 35 students total).

He also has an ethics framework that he thinks would be interesting to run
us through (about 2 hours of conversation). I like the idea of doing the
latter simply so we can say we've been very diligent about it, but think we
should stall the former until we know if Wharton is going to come through.
Thoughts?
