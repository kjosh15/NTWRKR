Not a bad problem to have!! Let me know if you'd like a second opinion on
potential tech purchases.

New address is:

Vi=C3=B0ifell
607 Akureyri
Iceland

The new school is St=C3=B3rutjarnask=C3=B3la. If you could send our records=
 would be
great.

Damn, doing this is just heartbreaking. We miss EB so much, but know that
being here is the right thing for our family for right now. Just know you
all had an immeasurable impact on our family - thank you!!

All best,
Josh
