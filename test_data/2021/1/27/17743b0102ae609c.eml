This is excellent work, Chris. I'm tempted to turn it into a pitch for
W50's D&I group but for the time being think it makes more sense to wait -
the last time we spoke they were more interested in a measurement tool for
assisting members in comparing notes on what did/didn't work than trying to
solve the problem itself for its members. Let me know if you have any
thoughts.

best,
Josh
