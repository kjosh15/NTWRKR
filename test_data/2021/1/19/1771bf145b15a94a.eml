Josh,

Wow, thanks for the reply! Was not expecting that. I guess my final question=
 is.... how honest are crows? And are they capable of deception?=20

For example, if a crow is trained to collect x and deposit into vending mach=
ine, will they begin depositing something similar in weight or appearance to=
 trick the machine? In other words, if properly trained over a period with a=
 human (or human remotely operating machine, not present at transaction) wil=
l they innovate to find ways to trick the machine? =F0=9F=A4=94 and do they h=
ave a tendency to innovate and experiment in groups? I never thought I would=
 have so many questions about crows, but here we are!

Thanks again for taking the time to discuss - I really appreciate it! Onward=
s... JSM
