The Art of Integrated Living
----------------------------

In the perennial best-seller The Alchemist (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/8ghqh3ug2o2v93hl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzM5R3lNYnY=3D
) by Paulo Coelho, an old man who calls himself the "king of
Salem" tells a story to the shepherd boy Santiago.

It's about a shopkeeper who sends his son to discover the secret
of happiness from the wisest man in the world, who lives high
atop a mountain. After a forty-day journey, the boy arrives at a
beautiful castle bustling with people engaging in trade, playing
music, and enjoying food.

After finally gaining the attention of the wise man, the boy is
told by the enlightened one that he doesn't have time to explain
the secret of happiness just yet. The sage suggests that the boy
look around the palace for a couple of hours while carrying a
teaspoon containing two drops of oil.

The boy is instructed to not to let the oil spill while he
explores.

He walks all over the palace for two hours, eyes fixed on the
spoon. The boy then returns to the wise man, who asks him what
he's noticed. The fine Persian tapestries? The magnificent
garden? The beautiful parchments in the library?

The boy embarrassingly admits he's seen nothing, as he was so
intent on not spilling the oil. The wise man sends the boy away
again to witness the marvels of the world around him. This time,
the boy soaks it all in, and returns to share everything he's
seen in great detail.

"But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?" asks the
wise man. The boy looks down and realizes the oil on the spoon is
gone.

At this point, the wise man reveals his secret:

"Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you," said
the wisest of wise men. "The secret of happiness is to see all
the marvels of the world, and never forget the drops of oil on
the spoon."
Santiago the shepherd boy immediately understands this story
shared by the king of Salem. A shepherd may love to travel, but
he should never forget about his flock.

Does Traditional Retirement Make Sense?
---------------------------------------

We've been told a different kind of story. A story where we spend
our entire working lives watching the drops of oil on the spoon.
Then, once we pass a magical age marker, we can see all the
marvels of the world.

That's why I'm so drawn to the idea of unretirement (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/vqh3hmunvov7g3fw/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC91bi1yZXRpcmVtZW50Lw=3D=3D
). Instead of bifurcating our lives into work and non-work at the
economic meridian of age 65, the idea is to integrate work and
wonder. That's something you can start making happen right now
and continue with as long as you're willing and able.

Contrast that approach with the fact that more than half (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/m2h7h6uoq3qpensl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9yZXRpcmUtb3ItY2hhbmdlLw=3D=3D
) of people end up not enjoying retirement (and that's those who
can afford it in the first place). You're supposed to be happy to
quit working and give up the sense of purpose you've cultivated
in your life for the remainder of your life, which makes no
sense.

Doesn't beginning to create your own integrated approach (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/dphehmuqoeog5qil/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC93b3JraW5nLXRvd2FyZC8=3D
) now make more sense? The true moral of the story is one of
integration between purpose and adventure, obligation and
exploration.

Livin' La Vida Integrada
------------------------

Integration works on a more basic life level as well.

Health, wealth, and personal growth are not independent
categories that you should make trade-offs between. Your life is
all one integrated whole, where each component enhances the
others to equal something more than the sum of its parts.

Exercise, nutrition, and sleep keep you healthy and also increase
your mental clarity and cognitive efficiency for work and
investing. Work brings you money and purpose, while also leading
to growth as you encounter and overcome challenges. A growth
mindset leads you to take on personal projects that alter your
identity.

Next thing you know, you're a better version of you -- and have
more incentive to take care of yourself so you can keep going.
It's the virtuous cycle of living your best life.

I'm not talking about work-life balance, which is always been a
bit of a farce. It's more about an integrated approach to your
entire life that makes the most of every day on all fronts.

Eyes Fixed on the Spoon

A 2020 study from Bank of America concludes that only 23% of
Generation Xers are confident about their progress on saving for
retirement. If you're in the other 77% and you're aiming to
retire in the 2030s, you need to step it up starting with 2021.

The Great Gatsby 2.0?
---------------------

Is a declining United States headed for collapse, or are we in
for a decade of prosperity similar to the 1920s? My take: the
convergence of several powerful technologies will make a ton of
money for people who can spot and leverage the opportunities,
while millions of the most vulnerable will lose jobs to robotics
and artificial intelligence. The pace of change will wreak
further havoc on US society unless some cohesive, unified
response is formulated and implemented.

Meditate Your Pain Away
-----------------------

By Trudi Roth

If it feels like your body is under siege, regardless of whether
you=E2=80=99ve had the virus, you=E2=80=99re not imagining things. The Atla=
ntic
confirms (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/3ohphduq232lzkap/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvMDEvcXVhcmFud=
GluZS1naXZpbmcteW91LWhlYWRhY2hlcy1iYWNrLXBhaW4tYW5kLW1vcmUvNjE3NjcyLw=3D=3D
) that you=E2=80=99re probably a =E2=80=9Cstiff, hunched-over, itchy, sore,
headachy husk.=E2=80=9D

While empirical evidence of the impact of COVID-related stress on
health is still being gathered, healthcare professionals
anecdotally report an uptick in complaints. For example, you
might be experiencing things like tendonitis, carpal tunnel, or
neck and back pain from the daily online grind from your couch or
kitchen table, only to grind your teeth all night until they
crack (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/wnh2h6urkqkp89hl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8wOC93ZWxsL2xpdmUvZGVudGlzdHMtdG9vd=

bA=3D=3D
).

Clearly, the chronic pain epidemic is expanding. And crafty
marketers are cashing in on our suffering with relaxation drinks
(
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/08hwhgum9295q9hp/aH=

y1zb20tc2xlZXAtcGVwc2ktYnJhbmRpbmc=3D
), promising bliss in a bottle from calm-inducing ingredients
like l-theanine, magnesium, and CBD.

As a meditation teacher, I can tell you chugging anything called
=E2=80=9CTranquini=E2=80=9D will do nothing beyond perhaps giving you gas.
Instead, fortify yourself with mind-body practices -- essential
weapons in your agony-busting arsenal.

Every Body Hurts
----------------

While pain is physiological, suffering is a mental affliction.
The ancients knew this, which is why meditation has been a
critical health tool for thousands of years.

The CDC reports (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/8ghqh3ug2o2vk3sl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9tbXdyL3ZvbHVtZXMvNjcvd3IvbW02NzM2YTIuaHRt
) that one in five adults lives with chronic pain, often turning
to opioids, which compounds the problem. To combat that spiral,
scientists are researching more holistic multi-disciplinary
approaches, including meditation and yoga.

In a 2020 study (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkue0knlvwi5h9xnq2tr/vqh3hmunvov783hw/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9icnlhbnJvYmluc29uLzIwMjAvMTAvMDMvZ3Jvd=
W5kYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3LXN0dWR5LXNob3dzLXlvZ2EtYW5kLW1lZGl0YXRpb24tYmVuZWZpdC1w=
aHlzaWNhbC1hbmQtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8=3D
) conducted in Oregon where access to care, addiction, and cost
are challenges, osteopath Dr. Cynthia Marske provided eight weeks
of mindfulness and hatha yoga training to patients suffering from
chronic pain and depression. Having seen encouraging results --
89% of subjects reported being able to cope and function better
-- Marske noted:

... Mindful yoga and meditation can help improve the structure
and function of the body, which supports the process of healing.
Curing means eliminating disease, while healing refers to
becoming more whole. With chronic pain, healing involves learning
to live with a level of pain that is manageable. For this, yoga
and meditation can be very beneficial.
This is in addition to the 3000+ studies that show meditation
improves your general well-being, reduces depression, anxiety and
stress, increases productivity, improves self control, and even
changes the composition of your brain for the better. Soon, not
meditating may be seen as pain in itself.

 castle bustling with people engaging in trade, playing music, and enjoying=
 food.</p>

, the boy is told by the enlightened one that he doesn't have time to expla=
in the secret of happiness just yet. The sage suggests that the boy look ar=

two drops of oil. </p>

hile he explores.</p>

xed on the spoon. The boy then returns to the wise man, who asks him what h=
e's noticed. The fine Persian tapestries? The magnificent garden? The beaut=
iful parchments in the library?</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">The boy embarrassingly admits he's seen nothing, as=
 he was so intent on not spilling the oil. The wise man sends the boy away =
again to witness the marvels of the world around him. This time, the boy so=
aks it all in, and returns to share everything he's seen in great detail.</=
