 Before I get the next draft over, wanted to make sure I answered your
questions:

- The only things that get frozen are our development materials we create
together, not the IP itself. What we could do is carve out a passive for
this. For example: if we don't sell what we've developed together, either
party can continue to try and sell it somewhere and if they are successful,
they pay a fee (15% of the fee for example).

- Re: the selling to a network and then moving elsewhere, either of those
scenarios are valid, but not without your involvement. That would be the
example above. What I'm referring to is, say Discovery buys the show,
produces ten episodes and then that's it, we could still take the format
elsewhere with a different title/slight format tweak. It would be a good
problem to have.

Does this answer the remaining points? Let me know if you are cool with
adding language for the first part.

Also, Dan wants to get moving on setting up a Zoom for you, which will mean
getting you a light and maybe a higher quality webcam and working on some
scripted content, which I'm going to dial in on this week. You cool
arranging this while we finalize the paperwork?

70/30 sounds great to me. Done. If you bring financing to the table to get =
this produced or co-produced (where the financier pays a portion and the ne=
twork pays a portion), then I would say we split this 50/50. In both instan=
ces I say we share any backend (residual income, off of network participati=

 50/50 as well.=C2=A0</div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Sounds go=

comes on board, usually the right can go a bunch of different ways, but oft=
en they revert back to us and we&#39;d share that 50/50, unless the financi=
er wanted a piece. At that point, the lawyers handle more than me. If it is=
 a straight commission from a network, the path is more clear: they own all=
 the rights to everything, generally, with some backend for us for licensin=
g and international, etc. If it&#39;s a Netlix, there is no backend, they j=
ust own it. No upside after the initial payments.=C2=A0<br></div></div></bl=
