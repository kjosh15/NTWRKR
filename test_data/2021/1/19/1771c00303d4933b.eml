Hi Josh,
Great talking with you yesterday! Always fun chatting about new cool =
technologies.

Here=E2=80=99s a Google doc =
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-sPhEC1-ybU1HhjzI5MLST5EAUpIz8yJRdr9=
D7JOS4/edit?usp=3Dsharing> describing the Personal Science Investment =
Fund we discussed. The original was pre-COVID and needs lots of =
updating, but the basics are simple:

A fund making $10K-$500K angel-sized investments in people and very =
early product ideas related to health tech
All products are wrapped into a dashboard-type app =
(https://personalscience.com) that makes it easy for early users to test =
how well the products work. Our portfolio companies focus on their =
science; we focus on proving it with the first customers.
Investors get insider pre-launch access to whatever cool gadgets or =
diagnostics we find.

It=E2=80=99s an investment fund centered around a software platform that =
treats clinical trials like Agile development, with an emphasis on fast, =
iterative deployment. There=E2=80=99s a network effect too, because more =
products means more data, which gives new insights to old data, and =
makes users more engaged and interested in ever newer products. It=E2=80=99=
s called =E2=80=9Cpersonal science=E2=80=9D because it brings research =
lab-style science to normal people.

Feel free to forward to whoever you think might be interested in helping =
flesh it out into something real.  I=E2=80=99m personally very excited =
about developing the software to enable this, but I=E2=80=99d want to be =
working with somebody with experience in venture funds.  With the right =
combination of people, this could very cool!
