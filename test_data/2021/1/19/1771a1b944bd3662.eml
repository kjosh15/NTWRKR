Funny you should say that; Patri and I have had plenty of conversations
about life in Iceland in the past!

My biggest, related challege ATM is accepting payments for international
contracts while fully taxable here in Iceland. Most of them are in NYC via
my LLC, and the tax questions are legion. Do you have any suggestions?

Much obliged!
