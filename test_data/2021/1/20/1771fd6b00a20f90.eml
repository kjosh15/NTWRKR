It's always possible, but I would suggest that we are much too small for
China to be sincerely worried about. Another point is that to date we've
had no interaction with the Chinese nor any Chinese firm (unlike Harvard),
nor do we participate much in publishing (unlike Harvard), nor are we
overtly critical of Chinese policy (unlike Harvard).

Passing encrypted data is always a flag for China, but it happens so
routinely and so systemically I don't think we're likely to trip any flags;
are we transiting primarily over ssh/ssl? If so, that's ridiculously common=
.

Overall we can't promise anything, but there is nothing that indicates we
should be concerned, and if it happens our data is asynchronous enough that
we have innumerable other encryption transit options we can quickly put in
place. (Maybe.)
