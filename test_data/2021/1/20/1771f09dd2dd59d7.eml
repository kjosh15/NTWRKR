Chris,

Running on 4 hours sleep so looking for some of that keenly incisive
thinking you're so famous for. Am working on a project with two folks that
might be useful, but am having a hard time clarifying on approach/priority.
Do you have a take?

1. David Preiser, Houlihan Lokey. Total curmudgeon but obviously very well
connected. Do you think he'd be worth the time to get his take on our
longer-term position (by way of potential introductions to immediate
funding opps?)

2. Christopher Schroeder, former CEO of washingtonpost.newsweek interactive
and LegiSlate.com. He's mostly focused on middle east and south American
markets but might be useful for feedback?

All best,
Josh
