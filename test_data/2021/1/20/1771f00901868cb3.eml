Gustavo,

Thanks for all this - I think we're almost there! A few more questions and
pics (attached). Once we have a final box count I can reserve a van and get
the document allowing you to drop the boxes off at the port.


   - Leave the dust collecting robot (the small square one?) It's broken.
   - What's in the pottery pot to the left of the stove, and are there any
   other utensils/anything in the kitchen drawers?
   - Did the sleeping bags get packed?
   - What's in the kids' bedroom closet? Can you send pics please?
   - Please take the stuff out of the top of both closets in the master
   bedroom and take a picture; we can't make out what's there.


All best,
Josh
