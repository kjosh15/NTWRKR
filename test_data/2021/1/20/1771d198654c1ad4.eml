            <p>In part because the ecosystem is still new, in part
              because a key catalyst is missing, proven form of fiat on
              chain. <br>
            </p>
            <p>We identified this dependency on fiat the commissioned
              report for a bank which we completed in the early days of
              Monerium.=C2=A0</p>
            <p>Money is quite sticky, strong network effects, absent a
              major global financial meltdown most people and companies
              will continue to use fiat for most applications for the
              foreseeable future. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For the emerging killer apps to be adopted by mainstrem -
              eg, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap - users need
              authorized digital cash. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Which leads to Monerium and e-money the closest possible
              proxy for Central Bank Digital Currency there is and will
              be for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>In terms of chemistry, the &quot;molecularity&quot; of the
              mainstream use cases is two, Fiat=C2=A0 + X. <br>
            </p>
            <p>With regards to Patri, the closest possible proxy for
              sea-steading is to apply for a digital nomad visa and move
              to Iceland. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The capital gains tax her is only 22%, not bad for a
              country that mostly functions and is covid-free at the
              moment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>All the best, <br>
            </p>
