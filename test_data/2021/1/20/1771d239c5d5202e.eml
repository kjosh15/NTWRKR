Hey Peter,

Hadn't heard back so I'm locking the video and related info down w/ these
credentials:

Name: investor5
Pword: j@Xald4$uPogG

I'm also attaching the latest version of the deck. Let me know if there's
interest and/or if you'd like to catch up sometime!

All best,
Josh

     <br>Happy new year - it's been pretty weird so far; here's hoping it g=

     <br>I'm writing after a decade-long hiatus since we last talked about =
wine reselling startups and REI roles to tell you that you were right. I fi=

     <br>We've got a SaaS platform with a unique expert system for measurin=
g and algorithmically managing corporate culture (behaviors, engagement, an=

ng a couple large multinationals, and now need &nbsp;funding to scale our a=
rchitecture to support our growth. (Obligatory deck attached.)
     <br>
     <br>This isn't core to the kinds of investments you've done in the pas=
t, but I've been meaning to reach out anyway just to reconnect and would lo=

 but when I look at all the easy money I keep coming back to our conversati=
ons about how investment wasn't just about $$. Now that I'm a founder mysel=
