Does this make sense to you?

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the quote I got from Ponoko was well
over $100. I uploaded the transparent file and it estimated to be just over
$40 for the one. So, I'm assuming that each sheet will be about the same
cost? In light of that I contacted a local maker space. Their laser cutters
are all 12". I'm not sure that I have the Inkscape skill to redraw/organize
the originals to a 12x12 plate.
