Very cool! Glad Hank is getting more of what he needs.

School here is different; there are 35 students and 45 staff in the whole
school. We pay a little more in taxes, but a school bus picks them up each
morning, they have a chef cook them breakfast and lunch, there=E2=80=99s po=
ttery
class and wood shop and swimming and sledding, an outdoor school
curriculum, etc. etc.

OTOH kids are often really rough with each other, with pushing and fighting
the norm. There=E2=80=99s a real =E2=80=9Ckids will be kids=E2=80=9D kind o=
f ignorance around that
kind of emotional intelligence that=E2=80=99s hard on Othinn specifically -=
 Haakon
seems to be completely fine with it.

I think the summary is that the boys are really getting their second
culture, which is a dream come true, but that nothing is perfect. How=E2=80=
=99s JH
faring?
