Can you take it from here? Or let me know what you think best next steps
are (and the kids' new school address!) and I'll forward it on.

xoxo,
Josh

Hi Josh,
Thank you.  I may take you up on it.  But right now, the surprising problem
seems to be spending money that we either have from grants or PTA funds.
No doubt we will do it, but it's one of the challenges of remote
schooling.... finding stuff to buy that's really needed.

Re:  Haakon and Othinn, nothing to do but send us your new address and name
of school.  Mia (cc'd here)  usually sends records to parents (or school
requesting) of kids that unenroll.  Would you like her to do that?  Let us
know, and good luck.

We look forward to putting the boys back on our rosters some day.

Betsy
