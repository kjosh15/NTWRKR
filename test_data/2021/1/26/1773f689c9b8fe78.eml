Glad to hear you're all well and healthy! The reno work sounds pretty
rewarding also. Life in Iceland is pretty great for a pandemic; we're now
on a 12-room farmhouse with fiber optic internet, its own water and power
supply and a barn full of firewood, so I've been smoking reindeer,
splitting wood, and shoveling snow. Lots of snow - at the moment the drifts
are up to the second floor windows...

Otherwise there were two cases of Covid here yesterday; life is pretty much
normal. The kids like their school, I'm working on a raise for
Indigometrics, and Hulda is eyeing some school programs (because a masters'
degree costs $70/year...) Moving to a place where the cost of living is
1/3rd as much, but with loads of social services, really fits when you have
little kids and a need to be heads-down building a startup. But damn... I
miss people!!

Hit me up for a zoom sometime and you can tell me all about plumbing or
woodwork or tiling or whatever it is you've been up to. This place has a
full woodshop and metalworking gear, so I could use inspiration on some
projects!

All best,
Josh
