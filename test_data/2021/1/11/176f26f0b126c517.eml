Jeffrey -

Hope Corning and your team there has been weathering the storm(s). We =
have been busy on the supply chain risk management front, in the wake of =
Solarwinds.=20

One concern I had when we first spoke, that persists, is the opacity of =
critical software platforms like ECCMA and their vulnerability to supply =
chain attacks, including attacks far less sophisticated than Solarwinds. =
Many of these platforms have credentials that convey the impression of =
cyber vigilance and active maintenance, because they had to go through a =
rigorous information assurance when they first went to market. But =
because they are legacy systems, this level of assurance has not =
necessarily been maintained.=20

The risk associated with a compromise of a keystone enterprise software =
capability is substantial enough to merit a greater level of ongoing =
transparency. We=E2=80=99re wondering if it=E2=80=99d be possible to =
work with you to pull a software bill of materials (SBOM) from ECCMA and =
analyze it for leading indicators of risk and compromise, as well as =
known vulnerabilities. This does not entail access to source code - just =
a list of third party dependencies.=20

This external dependency list is now required for any medical device =
seeking FDA approval, for similar reasons - the compromise of an open =
source software component in a chemotherapy infusion pump or pacemaker =
has safety implications that mandate transparency on the software =
ingredients list. Mayo Clinic=E2=80=99s T&Cs for business associates and =
suppliers are below, to give a sense of the seriousness attached to =
these risks in other domains of critical infrastructure.=20

If you=E2=80=99d like to pick up the conversation, let me know.



Best,

JC

>> Date: November 13, 2020 at 2:27:27 PM EST
>>=20
>> Mayo Clinic T&Cs:
>>=20
>> Open Source Software Security. Business Associate Designed Products =
do not, and shall not, require the use of any Open Source Software that =
is not actively maintained. =E2=80=9COpen Source Software=E2=80=9D means =
any software, programming, or other intellectual property that is =
subject to the GNU General Public License, GNU Library General Public =
License, Artistic License, BSD license, Mozilla Public License, or any =
similar license, including, but not limited to, those licenses listed at =
www.opensource.org/licenses <http://www.opensource.org/licenses>. Open =
Source Software is not considered actively maintained if (i) more than =
one (1) calendar year has passed since the last release, (ii) the Open =
Source Software=E2=80=99s official distribution web site does not list =
an individual who maintains the software, or (iii) the maintainer fails =
to response to questions or requests for security fixes for longer than =
one (1) month. In the event Open Source Software ceases to be actively =
maintained, Business Associate shall either replace such Open Source =
Software with an actively maintained equivalent, or begin active =
maintenance of such Open Source Software.
>>=20
>>=20
>> The operational question is: how do these T&Cs get enforced? Ion =
Channel maintains fully auditable longitudinal maintenance records on =
thousands of open source software components, including mapping of known =
vulnerabilities to transitive dependencies, levels of technical debt, =
community and maintenance risks, transfer of control and other supply =
chain events.=20
>>=20
>> These components are re-adjudicated as pass/fail daily according to =
customer-designated governance criteria. These can include:
>>=20
>> 	* Presence of Critical CVEs in any transitive dependency
>> 	* Presence of High CVEs in any transitive dependency
>> 	* Presence of outdated dependencies (we are working with =
customers to set policy thresholds on how many major-versions-behind is =
acceptable for dependencies - getting the answers from them is the hard =
part, enforcing the threshold is automatible).
>> 	* Presence of unspecified dependency versions
>> 	* Single committer components=20
>> 	* Virus
>> 	* No license
>> 	* Days since last update (we=E2=80=99re working with customers =
to set the policy threshold here - but this contract clause allows us to =
reference an industry standard of 1 year since last update).=20
>>=20
>> Ion Channel logs consecutive days-in-a-passing state, =
days-in-a-fail-sate and calculates MTTR for each component, which gives =
customers decision support about the likelihood of a component being =
fixed if a vulnerability does emerge.=20
>> =09
>> Two examples of open source project analysis are below. The first is =
OpenFDA, a federal OSS project for accessing FDA data. The second is a =
project called OpenHospital, an open source hospital-in-a-box developed =
by an Italian non-profit that claims to have 23 operational =
installations in 13 countries and to have processed 425,000 patients and =
their hospitalization/birth/vaccination data. If you scan OpenHospital =
today, you=E2=80=99ll find it=E2=80=99s green. What you won=E2=80=99t =
find is that OpenHospital contained three trojans for a solid six =
months. We have auditable records of that failing state. The data is =
open, portable and machine-readable and our T&Cs permit full API access =
and ingestion by third party automated processes and platforms.=20
>>=20
>> Bottom line: if you want to automate enforcement of the OSS security =
conditions, we can load a roster of open source components into a =
supply-chain monitoring account and automate daily analysis and =
pass/fail adjudication for all components in the inventory, which can be =
made available to your security personnel as well as your suppliers (Ion =
Channel has no seat licensing - we charge per component analysis for an =
unlimited number of end-users.=20
>>=20
>> Some of our more forward-leaning development addresses the =
operational deficiencies of CVEs for vulnerability management, since =
they are by definition a lagging indicator of risk. This includes =
platform capabilities to govern on committer count and technical debt, =
as well as some machine learning underway to predict the emergence of =
known vulnerabilities against components with no CVEs.=20

class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">The operational question =
is: how do these T&amp;Cs get enforced? Ion Channel maintains fully =
auditable longitudinal maintenance records on thousands of open source =
software components, including mapping of known vulnerabilities to =
transitive dependencies, levels of technical debt, community and =
maintenance risks, transfer of control and other supply chain =
events.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =

class=3D"">Ion Channel logs consecutive days-in-a-passing state, =
days-in-a-fail-sate and calculates MTTR for each component, which gives =
customers decision support about the likelihood of a component being =
fixed if a vulnerability does emerge.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><span =
class=3D"" style=3D"white-space: pre-wrap;">	</span></div><div =
class=3D"">Two examples of open source project analysis are below. The =
first is OpenFDA, a federal OSS project for accessing FDA data. The =
second is a project called OpenHospital, an open source =
hospital-in-a-box developed by an Italian non-profit that claims to have =
23 operational installations in 13 countries and to have processed =
425,000 patients and their hospitalization/birth/vaccination data. If =
you scan OpenHospital today, you=E2=80=99ll find it=E2=80=99s green. =
What you won=E2=80=99t find is that OpenHospital contained three trojans =
for a solid six months. We have auditable records of that failing state. =
The data is open, portable and machine-readable and our T&amp;Cs permit =
full API access and ingestion by third party automated processes and =
platforms.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Bottom line: if you want to automate enforcement of the OSS =
security conditions, we can load a roster of open source components into =
a supply-chain monitoring account and automate daily analysis and =
pass/fail adjudication for all components in the inventory, which can be =
made available to your security personnel as well as your suppliers (Ion =
Channel has no seat licensing - we charge per component analysis for an =
unlimited number of end-users.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Some of our more forward-leaning =
development addresses the operational deficiencies of CVEs for =
vulnerability management, since they are by definition a lagging =
indicator of risk. This includes platform capabilities to govern on =
committer count and technical debt, as well as some machine learning =
underway to predict the emergence of known vulnerabilities against =
components with no =
CVEs.&nbsp;</div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div></blockquote><=
