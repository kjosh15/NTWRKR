I'm speaking to this guy
<https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/Faculty/FacultyBios/Golu=
bov>
tomorrow. He's well connected to another network of executives that have
been courting me to hold a "Future of Work" group, so could provide some
useful access beyond just advice.

I've got a shortlist of questions (mostly around what he recommends and
what he sees coming in 2021-2022) on our strategy but wondered if you had
anything to add / ask.

All best,
Josh
