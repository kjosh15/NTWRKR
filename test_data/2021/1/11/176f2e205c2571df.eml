Hey,

Figure I'm around TUTH mornings along with weekends.  That should fit GMT.

So what does " tv pitch using GPT-3 and AI to surface bias leveraging the
uncanny valley " mean.  I mean, what's the cheap trashy TV log-line on this=
?

Yeah. I don't know where to get into the SHARP thread. I basically believe
Q-Anon is an ARG that is turning serious and that these are trolls. That
having been said, I have people whose opinions I respect who've come to
believe it is more than that.

The truth is that nobody cared when L.A. got looted and burned or that the
Federal Building park where my kids played football, soccer and baseball is
a homeless camp, so, I'm having trouble caring much what happens to the
Capitol.  In other words, when they start caring about my problems, I'll
start caring about theirs.  Right now, I just want the vaccine (which is
also being botched in California) and think there are a lot of. nastier
things to worry about than people who feel that the election was
manipulated, because, to some extent it was.  They have a point.  Officials
should plan their next move very carefully, because this can blow up.  The
U.S. is like a band that lost its fan base.

How's that for a dark assessment.

I only have two sources of information:  what I see with my own eyes and
what I happen to hear. I've pretty much shut off media and have a book, a
TV Treatment and a cool new project to show for it.  The world will get by
just fine without my opinion.

Flint
