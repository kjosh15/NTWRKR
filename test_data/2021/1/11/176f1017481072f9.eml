Let me know if you have time to touch base again in the next couple weeks;
esp. given the bombastic shit-throwing on the SHARP list I'm curious to get
your take on the world.

For my part, we've moved to Iceland and I'm working on a tv pitch using
GPT-3 and AI to surface bias leveraging the uncanny valley - seems like
your playpen. :) Pick a time here <http://josh.is/scheduling> or suggest
something that works GMT?

All best,
Josh
