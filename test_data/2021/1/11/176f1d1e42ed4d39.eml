Chris,

Just had a quick and useful call w/ David at Bechtel. He brought up the SSO
issue unprompted and suggested that the best way in would be to only allow
management dashboards to be accessed via SSO - i.e., to have all craft
professionals use their own email w/out SSO/2FA. He was going to push Misha
separately to get that done as he thinks ITSec needs to capitulate here out
of reason.

Separately, he agreed that figuring out WHO is going to be in this rollout
is paramount. He has a call this Thursday with the construction D&I
steering committee; they'll be launching the We Are Bechtel and that'll
inform who they send this to. He's also got two other projects he's been
engaging with as well as the potential for a couple other projects coming
online, meaning more users out of the gate in the next phase.

TL;DR: he knows we need to find out who's enrolling sooner rather than
later.

Finally, they're running SAP, so we should prepare for that as much as we
can.

All best,
Josh
