Oscar,

Happy new year!! It's off to an interesting start, but here's hoping for
big improvements.

I was trying to disentangle the payment issue and was wondering if you'd
been able to ensure that the payroll vendor can submit payments to a new
potential entity (you were going to forward me the payment paperwork the
payroll vendor will need) and that payments to the potential Icelandic
entity doesn=E2=80=99t expose Accenture to unknown tax risk liability.

Let me know if you have any updates and/or if I can provide any further
info.

Thanks!
Josh
