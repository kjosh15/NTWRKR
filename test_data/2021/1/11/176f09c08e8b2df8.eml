I've just started reading the very long discussion on 'The State of The
World - 2021' - engaged in by 'ancient' participants of 'The Well' - Bruce
Sterling, Jon Lebkowsky, and Malka Older.
https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/510/State-of-the-World-2021=
-page01.html


Just wanted to share the first paragraph of the first statement.

*Our contemporary media reality is a world of opinions, and opinions of
opinions. Our media sense organs are clogged with the cruft of opinion, we
hear little else. Factual accounts are occluded by excess of
interpretation.   *

We need conversation and institutions of conversation just as much as we
ever needed them.

I'm very thankful to have the privilege of hearing some many deeply
knowledge-able people.

is recent discussion takes on a more sinister character since Wednesday&#39=
;s events. Prominent among the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol on =
Wednesday a few blocks from where I live were open followers of the QAnon a=
lternative reality game/set of conspiracy theories/political movement. Nota=
ble among reports from the journalists inside the Capitol was the casual at=
titude the insurrectionists had to breaking Federal law; some even said the=
y didn&#39;t appear to realize what they were doing was illegal or outrageo=
us even as they beat and chased the building&#39;s defenders.=20
Many did not seem to understand the distinction between the Capitol being &=
quot;the people&#39;s house&quot; and the Capitol and everything in it actu=
ally belonging to them. Video has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a =
Capitol police officer up the stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man =
who stood on the House Dais and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as &quo=
t;the QAnon Shaman.&quot;

One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incens=
ed that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, sh=
e was only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to star=
t a revolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divo=
rced from reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democr=
acy. They and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and =
politicians who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity t=
o marvel at, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the gov=
ernment, and they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. <=
/div><div><br></div><div>Wednesday&#39;s well-documented events have made t=
he United States a laughing stock around the world and will stain our reput=
ation for the rest of our history. The next time someone tries to minimize =
these events, remind yourself that <b>the United States Government lost con=
trol of the Capitol building to an extremist group for several hours</b>, r=
esulting in at least five deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal propert=
y, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representati=
ves, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congre=
ss. Let&#39;s not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should=
 be no excuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And ye=
t, the disinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on dis=
proven narratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers =
are now trying to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAn=
on cult members responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures=
 are correcting them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would =
not allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for th=
e insurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforceme=
nt and frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that&#39;s making the rounds =
in right-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the=
 latest emergent narrative from Wednesday&#39;s events--they didn&#39;t act=
ually happen at all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No on=
e actually stormed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somew=
here in Hollywood.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President&#39;s video condemnin=
g the insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is=
 still urging them on.

To me, it&#39;s bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any=
 other conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, &quot;leader=
s&quot; of such milieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly =
encouraging others to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on=
 their own initiative. After all, we&#39;re not talking about hierarchical,=
 tightly-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely =
virtual communities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculi=
ar political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially &quot;dangerou=
s,&quot; one could conceivably justify placing millions of people under sur=
veillance. Not for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don&#39;t think any of us would like t=
o live in such a society, i.e., where &quot;thought crimes&quot; alone were=
 punished.</div>

Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain crimina=

uspicion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activit=
y and the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshal=
l not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the polit=
ical, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individ=
ual or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relate=
s to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that th=
e subject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or a=
ctivity.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informat=
ion exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforce=
ment or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a =
basis to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable =
criminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if lar=
ge numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is=
 not sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.=C2=
=A0 For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furt=
herance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertake=
n when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimi=
nal intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of gro=
ups such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club=
 (i.e. is it a club or gang).=C2=A0 The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the =
Insane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally pr=
edicated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are =
several examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes =
of violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and id=
eology.=C2=A0 The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find w=
ith groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle g=
angs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it w=
ould be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. =C2=A0 <b=
r>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence i=
n support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon ha=
d the criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. =
=C2=A0 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 What was and is the intent of those who originally =
organized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial i=
nterest in finding out?<br>
<br>
