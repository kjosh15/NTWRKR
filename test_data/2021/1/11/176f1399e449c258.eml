I thought it might be more efficient to recap the information we need,
below. We may be able to ship as soon as this Wednesday, so your attention
is appreciated.

Again, we're shipping ~30 boxes, each ~50lbs, by sea from 33-53 82nd st,
Jackson Heights NY 11372 to Vidifell, 607 Akureyri, Iceland. We can drop
the boxes off at your facility in the NY/NJ area. Please provide pricing
for pick up both at the port in Reykjavik and shipping to Akureyri if
available.

We need a complete cost breakdown, including whichever are relevant from
the below as well as any additional costs:

Port-to-port Shipping
Export Document Fee
DTHC/port handling charges
Customs clearance pick-up POE
Handling charges
Insurance for $5k estimated value
Palletizing
Storage charges pr/month (if we can't pick them up right away)
Any Additional fees (please detail)

Finally, please also include:

Time to delivery
NY Drop-off location
Required paperwork

Once we have this information we can begin the ordering process. Again, we
may be able to do this as soon as Wednesday so receiving this information
immediately would be a big help.

Thanks very much,
Josh
