So you got it running, huh? Make sure you observe lathe safety precautions-
roll up your sleeves, take off any watches or bracelets. Make sure that the
tool rest is installed, too.

I want to get a lathe.

Hey you might like "The Woodwright's Shop" - it's an American PBS show
about traditional woodworking. Woodworking with muscle power and hand tools
only, like in the 18th century. I don't know if it can be watched online
but here's the PBS site for it:

https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/

He has this cool lathe that he built. It has a treadle-type apparatus where
you work it with a pedal and a big long willow stick is used to store and
release the energy. It's nuts! The workpiece rotates in both directions,
though, so you have to be careful to only apply the tool while the work is
rotating away from you.

Even if you don't care to work like this or make the stuff he makes, it can
be fascinating to see how fabrication problems were solved (usually by
developing special tools) a couple hundred years ago.

You need to put together a 4 pound bag of sand or flour and test plonking
it down on your Crowbox when you get it back. I think that idea we
discussed where you dampen the impact with weather stripping foam will be
simple and effective. I wonder if we need to consider upgrading the limit
switches...
