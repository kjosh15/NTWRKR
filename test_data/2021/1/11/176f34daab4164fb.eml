Joshua,
   Thanks for the tip re the podcast. It said =E2=80=9Cdownload =E2=80=9C so=
 I assumed it meant that it had to be downloaded rather than streamed. I hav=
e listened to it and Sarah is in it in many places. It speaks to the develop=
ment of the vaccines rather than address future problems. Since they intervi=
ew the developers of the vaccines, obviously all comments lean toward the gl=
owing positives rather than introduce any negatives. While our initial inter=
est/concern was spurred by my vascular surgeon, she is only one individual a=
nd not in any way connected to the virus or vaccine development. However, th=
e reluctance on the part of such a large percentage of front-line workers ca=
uses further concern. If it were generally considered safe, why are so many n=
urses refusing the vaccine. I can=E2=80=99t help but feel that there is some=
thing under a rock somewhere that those in positions of responsibility are r=
eluctant to turn over and bring to light.=20

Love,
DAD
