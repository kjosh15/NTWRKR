You caught me, just!

Huh; what do you think accounts for the increased power draw?

I=E2=80=99d be curious if anyone online has done a side-by-side of the rock=
etscream
vs the official library: could that save you some trouble?

Last thing is I=E2=80=99m stoked to see what the voltaic does. Could be a r=
eal game
changer, esp. in conjunction with the power savings you=E2=80=99re finding!
