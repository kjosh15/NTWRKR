Scott,

It's been almost a decade since we last met for breakfast at Balthazar in
NYC. The world's a really different place now, but the advice you gave me
then stuck: I was jumping around all kinds of projects and you told me to
dig deeper to find the problem I really wanted to solve.

It took a while - two more books, two more documentary tv series, and a lot
of consulting work -  but I'm there. I've built a SaaS platform with a
unique expert system for measuring and algorithmically managing corporate
culture (behaviors, engagement, and alignment). We're tackling D&I head-on
and have 18 customers, including two large multinationals with four more in
the pipeline.

Now we need resources to scale fast. It seems like there's a shitstorm of
investment out there, but when I look at all the easy money I keep coming
back to our conversations over breakfast and how I walked away every time
feeling inspired to do better in the world.

That's the kind of partner we're looking for now. I've attached our deck;
can we set up a call to see if there's a fit?

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
