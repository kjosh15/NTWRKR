Happy new year! It's been pretty strange so far...

I've been asked to look at a startup in your space (monerium.com) based
here in Iceland (where we moved in June) and would love to get your take.

Separately, I'm raising funds for my own startup (www.indigometrics.com)
and could use your advice! The VC world has changed a bit since I last dug
into it a decade ago.

Let me know if you have any time for a brief call in the next couple weeks,
and regardless please do send an update the next time you're able; I'm
always keen to help if I can.

All best wishes,
Josh
