Eric,

Peter Hershberg introduced us a decade ago just after my second book was
published, when I was looking at becoming an REI. Instead, I ended up doing
executive tech consulting, found a problem I couldn't resist, and built a
SaaS + expert system to change corporate culture for the better (
www.indigometrics.com).

Now we're looking to raise funds to accelerate the changes Covid-19 made to
how corporations operate. You've invested in AirTable and similar
data-based visualization platforms, so I'm betting you'll get why
IndigoMetrics is perfectly poised for this.

You were recently quoted here
<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/this-is-insanity-start-ups-e=
nd-year-in-a-deal-frenzy.html>
about how there is an investment gold rush on. I'm not interested in
ill-informed investors who want to throw money around. Peter impressed on
me early the value of working with the right partners, and I've followed
your work ever since. I've attached our deck; can we have a brief
conversation to see if we're a fit?

All best wishes,
Josh
