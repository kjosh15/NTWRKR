First, I hope you all are well in light of recent events. Batshit
craziness. Come visit us in Iceland anytime!

How's this for a very-long bio (give me an inch and I'll take a mile... ):

###

Josh Klein primarily consults C-level executives on technology and
innovation strategy. Past crypto work has included designing an early
decentralized reputation system, helping build the Bankinter think tank
event on cryptocurrencies in an evolving financial regulatory environment,
and consulting to one of the world's largest petrochemical companies on
blockchain in energy markets.

Josh has hosted three documentary television series, including Smart China
- a series about globally disruptive innovation, investment, and technology
in China - which led to work with a number of leading east asian VC
investors. Past books include Hacking Work (on disruptive mid-level
management) and Reputation Economics (on scaled social data).

At present Josh serves as CEO of Indigometrics, a SaaS expert system that
measures and algorithmically manages corporate culture (behavior,
alignment, and engagement) with a focus on DE&I.

###

Let me know if you'd like me to trim it down. Also, will Flint be involved?
Hit me with more deets, and thanks again!
