 Heya-

All good and if you want to consult counsel when we are at final draft,
totally fine by me. I'm happy to share redacted similar agreements for
comparison if it makes you more comfortable, but this is pretty standard.
The only difference is the profit share.

Here are my thoughts:

- 70/30 sounds great to me. Done. If you bring financing to the table to
get this produced or co-produced (where the financier pays a portion and
the network pays a portion), then I would say we split this 50/50. In both
instances I say we share any backend (residual income, off of network
participation, like someone wanting to do a branded series spin-off, or any
licensing) 50/50 as well.

- I answered part of the question above, but if a financier comes on board,
usually the right can go a bunch of different ways, but often they revert
back to us and we'd share that 50/50, unless the financier wanted a piece.
At that point, the lawyers handle more than me. If it is a straight
commission from a network, the path is more clear: they own all the rights
to everything, generally, with some backend for us for licensing and
international, etc. If it's a Netlix, there is no backend, they just own
it. No upside after the initial payments.

- I will mention rights for the IP if it's abandoned, but in a nutshell: If
you walk away, we can still try to produce it but we owe you a fee. You can
still try to produce it but any materials we created with you are frozen.

- One other note: Say we produce this version for Discovery and then want
to take it elsewhere. The short of it is: we can but it would be under a
different name. Same as Bourdain's shows. Materially they are the same.

How does all this sound to you?
