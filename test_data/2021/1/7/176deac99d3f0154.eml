Hey Josh,

In terms of converting to a C corp. I don't think that would be what you
are looking to do.  In a C-corp, you can take "distributions"; anything you
take out of the business would have to go through payroll and you'd pay
payroll taxes on it (SS and Medicare twice as employee and employer).

As much as I'd love to continue working with you, your questions may be a
bit above my pay grade and I don't want to give you the wrong information.
(as good/tough as these questions are).  I think you might be better off
with someone that may have a bit more experience with the situation you are
in.

I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful to you!

Stephanie

hanie! I hope you&#39;re doing well, all things considered. The interesting=
 times continue...<br><br>I had a question about how to wrap up taxes for 2=
020. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve made less than the $103k maximum for for=
eign residency (above which you have to pay the US regardless of where you =
live.) Given that, we have two choices:<br><br>1) We can file taxes in Icel=
and on what we DID make and via the double taxation treaty write off the US=
 taxes. If we do this, can you manage that paperwork? (<a href=3D"http://ww=
w.greenbacktaxservices.com" target=3D"_blank">www.greenbacktaxservices.com<=
/a> has an estimate form which lists the exact forms needed.)<br><br>2) We =
can claim no earnings to Iceland, file as normal in NYC, and then switch to=
 fully Icelandic in 2021. This would save us taxes (as the rates are higher=
 in Iceland) and may be cleaner overall, but I&#39;m not sure what/if there=
 are risks. <br><br>Can you let us know about #1, and if you have any view =
on #2?<br><br>Much obliged and all best wishes,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspac=
