Peter,

Happy new year - it's been pretty weird so far; here's hoping it gets
better!

I'm writing after a decade-long hiatus since we last talked about wine
reselling startups and REI roles to tell you that you were right. I finally
found a problem I couldn't stop trying to solve, and built my own company
around it. (www.indigometrics.com)

We've got a SaaS platform with a unique expert system for measuring and
algorithmically managing corporate culture (behaviors, engagement, and
alignment). We're tackling D&I head-on and have 18 customers, including a
couple large multinationals, and now need  funding to scale our
architecture to support our growth. (Obligatory deck attached.)

This isn't core to the kinds of investments you've done in the past, but
I've been meaning to reach out anyway just to reconnect and would love your
opinion. It seems like there's a shitstorm of investment out there, but
when I look at all the easy money I keep coming back to our conversations
about how investment wasn't just about $$. Now that I'm a founder myself
that seems more true than ever.

Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the week ahead, and all
best wishes to you and yours in these crazy times!

All best,
Josh Klein

P.S. It's been a weird decade; here's <http://www.josh.is> some context on
what I've been up to!
