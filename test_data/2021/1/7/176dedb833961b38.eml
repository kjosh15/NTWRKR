So I have a newbie question that you might have an opinion on. The house
we=E2=80=99re in was owned by a woman (who has now passed on, and her daugh=
ter is a
grandma...) who was into wood working. There is a wood shop in the attic
with all sorts of great tools.

The one I=E2=80=99m particularly keen on is a giant (5=E2=80=9D long base) =
lathe. I finally
got five minutes while the kids were brushing their teeth to plug it in and
the motor started right up, but the spindle didn=E2=80=99t turn.

I opened the housing and the cable wasn=E2=80=99t turning - the spindles ra=
n just
fine but the cable was too loose. So I grabbed my leather man, tightened it
up to where it seemed snug, and blew the fuse for half of the house.

I was able to replace the fuse (the house was built in the 60=E2=80=99s so =
it takes
huge old ceramic ones - luckily there were spares!) but I=E2=80=99m not kee=
n to do
it again. Any tips on finding a good tension beyond loosening it until it
seems almost too loose and then adjusting slight amounts at a time? And and
all recommendations on stuff to look out for is welcome!

Much obliged,
Josh
