Happy new year! (Ish.)

I've been waiting for a reason to reconnect since you first invited me to
speak at a brown bag lunch nearly a decade ago, and I think it might be
time.

I've built a SaaS expert system <http://www.indigometrics.com> for
measuring and algorithmically managing corporate culture (behaviors,
engagement, and alignment). We're tackling D&I head-on and have 18
customers, including a couple large multinationals, and now need  funding
to scale our architecture to support our growth. (Obligatory deck attached.=
)

Due warning - this isn't core to the kinds of investments you normally do.
But I've been meaning to reach out anyway just to reconnect and would love
your opinion. It seems like there's a shitstorm of investment out there,
but when I look at all the crazy investments being made I keep coming back
to our very first conversations where you stressed how investment wasn't
just about $$. Now that I'm a founder myself that seems more true than ever=
.

Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the weeks ahead, and all
best wishes to you and yours in these crazy times!

All best,
Josh Klein

P.S. It's been a weird decade; here's some context on what I've been up to!
