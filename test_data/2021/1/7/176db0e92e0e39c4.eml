Hi Steve,

I am a Big Fan of Crows, and have four to six "regulars" that show up daily
for peanuts, cheese, etc.
I suspect that getting from where I am with them.... to getting them to
deposit coins for food,
would be a rather large leap.  Plus, mine are a little short of cash, or so
it seems.

However, I am on the email list of the "CrowBox" people...and would very
much like to learn from you
who is this seemingly large audience you have with interest in the
"CrowBox"...
academics doing research with Crows and other animals?
Crow -Specific people/non-academic?
Any insight you might shed on this particular group would be of some
interest over my way.
Thanks.
James Perry
