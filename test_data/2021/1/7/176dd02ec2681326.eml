Gustavo,

Please forgive all the emails; I figure it's better to over-communicate!
Just wanted to update you that I have four shipping companies coming back
to me with final rates and drop off destinations. Based on that we can
choose the final candidate and book for delivery.

In the meantime, let me know if you think we'll need a van or a truck, and
if the following process looks right:

a. you were going to get everything packed up this week (which it sounds
like may be delayed by a couple days).
b. Once you're done, we can review anything you'd like to buy.
c. Then we'll do a video walkthrough of anything else that is left.
d. After that, we'd like to have our friends Weena and Lee do a walkthrough
to see if they'd like to have anything.
e. Then we can move everything to the shipping company. (By you and two
friends, each of whom would get $120)
f. Once that's done we can work on selling anything else when you leave.
(Maybe one of your friends would like to help with this?)


Again, this is just for purposes of getting a timeline put in place. Let me
know if the above structure sounds right and we can talk about reserving
dates!

Finally, let me know if a call this Sunday would work for you and if
there's anything else I'm forgetting or can do to help.

All best,
Josh
