yes this sounds about right.  Let's do a call sunday. also $120 its an
estimate depending on how many hours the moving will take and the
destination. If you have those details please forward them to me. I am
confirming my friend and his friend to be able wednesday. my friend is not
available before then. a van wont work for 30 boxes unless we do two trips.
it depends how far the shipping location is. truck might be best.
