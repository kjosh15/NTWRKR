Daniel,

If you believe the truth is somewhere between yourself and QAnon, you are
welcome to question your assumptions, build that bridge, and look for it. I
will not be joining you.

To be an American should be to be angry about what happened on Wednesday,
when an entire branch of the US Government fled for their lives from an
insurrectionist mob operating on incitement and misinformation. That
shouldn't be a political statement or indicative of bias. If it is, we are
already lost, and my anger doesn't change that--even if it does impact my
IQ.

Kind regards,

Dustin C. McCrae

t;the QAnon Shaman.&quot;

One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incens=
ed that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, sh=
e was only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to star=
t a revolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divo=
rced from reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democr=
acy. They and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and =
politicians who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity t=
o marvel at, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the gov=
ernment, and they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. <=
/div><div><br></div><div>Wednesday&#39;s well-documented events have made t=
he United States a laughing stock around the world and will stain our reput=
ation for the rest of our history. The next time someone tries to minimize =
these events, remind yourself that <b>the United States Government lost con=
trol of the Capitol building to an extremist group for several hours</b>, r=
esulting in at least five deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal propert=
y, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representati=
ves, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congre=
ss. Let&#39;s not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should=
 be no excuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And ye=
t, the disinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on dis=
proven narratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers =
are now trying to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAn=
on cult members responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures=
 are correcting them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would =
not allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for th=
e insurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforceme=
nt and frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that&#39;s making the rounds =
in right-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the=
 latest emergent narrative from Wednesday&#39;s events--they didn&#39;t act=
ually happen at all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No on=
e actually stormed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somew=
here in Hollywood.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President&#39;s video condemnin=
g the insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is=
 still urging them on.

To me, it&#39;s bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any=
 other conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, &quot;leader=
s&quot; of such milieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly =
encouraging others to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on=
 their own initiative. After all, we&#39;re not talking about hierarchical,=
 tightly-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely =
virtual communities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculi=
ar political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially &quot;dangerou=
s,&quot; one could conceivably justify placing millions of people under sur=
veillance. Not for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don&#39;t think any of us would like t=
o live in such a society, i.e., where &quot;thought crimes&quot; alone were=
 punished.</div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>
</div>
<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a ga=
me designer was fascinating.=C2=A0 I have been interested, for some time, i=
n how QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.=C2=A0 The first question to =
answer is whether it is appropriate and lawful
 for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAno=
n and/or members of QAnon.<br>
<br>
Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain crimina=
l intelligence information concerning a group only if there is reasonable s=
uspicion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activit=
y and the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshal=
l not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the polit=
ical, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individ=
ual or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relate=
s to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that th=
e subject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or a=
ctivity.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informat=
ion exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforce=
ment or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a =
basis to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable =
criminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if lar=
ge numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is=
 not sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.=C2=
=A0 For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furt=
herance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertake=
n when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimi=
nal intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of gro=
ups such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club=
 (i.e. is it a club or gang).=C2=A0 The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the =
Insane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally pr=
edicated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are =
several examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes =
of violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and id=
eology.=C2=A0 The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find w=
ith groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle g=
angs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it w=
ould be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. =C2=A0 <b=
r>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence i=
n support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon ha=
d the criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. =
=C2=A0 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 What was and is the intent of those who originally =
organized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial i=
nterest in finding out?<br>
<br>
