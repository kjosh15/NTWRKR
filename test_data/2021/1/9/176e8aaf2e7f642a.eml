Joshua,
  I=E2=80=99m confident the podcast is worthwhile. However, after over a hal=
f-hour of downloading - with no ability to access the podcast - I had to dec=
ide how long it is worth waiting to download a 50 minute podcast. Perhaps it=
 will finally download at some point and we can listen to it. Have you liste=
ned to it?  =46rom the title, it seems to address the development of the vac=
cine and our interests are in regard to the long-term effects which, of cour=
se, at this point in time are impossible to know. One can say that in the pa=
st vaccines have generally shown any adverse effects within a short period o=
f time. However, past performance is no predictor of future events. How the h=
eck can one have more than a prayer or hope that all will be well in this as=
 yet unproven vaccine. REMEMBER, the release and approval are for an EXPERIM=
ENTAL vaccine. It has NOT received unconditional approval for use.
  We are still interested in the podcast - if - we can get it downloaded.=20=


Love,
DAD
