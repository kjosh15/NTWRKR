My folks are scientifically literate but old, and living way out in the
countryside. They've been counseled by their MD to put off getting the
vaccine until there is more evidence it won't have a negative affect.

Do you have any scientific papers you can suggest which I could pass to my
folks to convince them to get vaccinated as soon as possible? I think it's
just a matter of them being overloaded by a bad information ecosystem, so
I'm hopeful that some actual science will tip them over. Any suggestions
appreciated.

Thanks again for the call yesterday - keep me posted about the Oxford role!

All best wishes
