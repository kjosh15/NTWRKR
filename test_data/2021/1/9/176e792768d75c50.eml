I asked a friend of mine (the head of the board of advisors for Oxford's
R&D lab - the one doing all their Covid work since March) if she had a
scientific article that might help inform this decision and she sent this:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p092qc76

"Not a Nature paper but a podcast by a former NASA MD who is skeptical
about the speed of vaccine development."

I'd be very curious to hear your take on this; we're lucky that we can
follow enough of the science to educate our own choices!

xoxo,
Josh
