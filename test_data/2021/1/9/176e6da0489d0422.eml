Thanks Gustavo. Most of the shipping companies are by the bay (obvs), many
on the NJ side, so about 45m away.

How did the packing go - you were fast!! Let us know when would be good for
our friends Weena and Lee to come by for a walkthrough and we'll check
their availability this weekend. After that, when is best for you to do a
video walk through?

All best wishes,
Josh
