Can you please pull a couple business documents from the same box that had
our lease docs and scan and send me:

Articles of Incorporation
Business Organizational Documents

I need them for my PPP loan application. I'm hoping them open up the PPP
applications asap; I could use the funds to pay for the shipping!!

Many thanks,
Josh
