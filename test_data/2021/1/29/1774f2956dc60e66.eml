Chris,

Two other specific points of feedback I got that we were missing on the
deck were ARR and metrics on benefits achieved. Any way we can swag at
either?

It may be that RELX can help with the former, but I figured I'd push again
for the latter in case anything has come up. Barring that I'm putting more
pics of the platform into the deck (as advised).

best,
Josh
