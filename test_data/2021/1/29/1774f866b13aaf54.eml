Yes, hello.

There would be a big savings using wood, especially if I can design it for
a piece of lumber that Home Depot has in good supply. You know, like an 8
or 12 inch wide pine board that the user can have cut to length right there
in the store for free. You know, buy a 5 foot long board and have it
chopped into the four panels, baseplate, and lid. The remaining work would
be screwing the wood together to make the box, and using a drill to make
holes in the wood for the tabs in the plastic parts. We can't/shouldn't
redesign the plastic parts, so the wood enclosure has to bear the brunt of
the design workarounds. It's hard to cut slots in wood if you're not a
somewhat skilled woodworker so I'd just figure out a way to do it all by
drilling holes, or series of holes to make slots.

I'll think about it a bit.

I just uploaded the transparent plastic parts to the first service on your
list that handles acrylic. $47 to make the sheet of transparent parts,
minus shipping. Ugh.

I just spot checked acrylic prices and they haven't changed much over the
past couple of years.

I gotta run. Seems the tree that fell in our backyard ripped up part of the
septic drain field so I have to go give it a sniff :(
