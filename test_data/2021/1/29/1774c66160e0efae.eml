OK, I don't think our user made any mistakes.

I uploaded the transparent parts, picked a 15x15 transparent sheet as my
material (3mm thick) and the quote came back at $27 and some change. PLUS a
$15 charge for the human-handling of the parts. So, yes, it came to over
$40 for that one sheet. I didn't upload the other parts to get the total
'new' Ponoko price but I did notice that the transparent acrylic is the
cheapest. So all of those other sheets are going to cost more.

I don't know if the $15 charge for people moving the plastic around is per
order or what, but it does look like Ponoko now has a very poor price point
for manufacturing the parts of a Crowbox kit.

This is bummer news for us. I wonder if this means we should consider
stepping up work on the Crowbox that is made of a larger percentage of less
expensive and complex materials. Like wood. And I don't mean laser cut
wood, I mean the current set of acrylic guts (and basket) housed in a
simpler wood housing.

We should talk about what we want to do. I guess folks who can get to a
makerspace or know someone with a cutter can still get their boxes made
without too much expense but anyone who was counting on ordering from
Ponoko just suffered a steep increase in cost.
