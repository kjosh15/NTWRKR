Oh hell yes!! So far what I've heard is congruent with your guess that VCs
want to know they'll be able to get into a bigger round, but the idea that
we're doing a small raise now for infrastructure and will do a larger one
later for sales seems to fly. I'm a little concerned about their control
should we want to do M&A instead, but otherwise how would you change the
models?
