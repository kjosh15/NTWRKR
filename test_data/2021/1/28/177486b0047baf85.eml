Next time we VC I'll teach you to say it. It's all quite simple really...

w is oo.
f is v.
ff is f.
dd is th.
u is ee or i.
y is the unstressed vowel, usually (except when it is in the last syllable,
when it is also ee or i).
ch is like in scottish.
ll is kinda like thl (halfway to ch, tho).
Everything else is like English. Well, except accented letters, but let's
leave it there for now.

The last two syllables of words are stressed equally.

There you go.

Oh, its different in North Wales, too.

FWIW, Erw Wen means (roughly) White Acre. Llanwrda is kinda Saint Wrda.
Harford ought to be said like Harvard but because it is actually an English
name people often pronounce it as you would in English. Our neighbouring
village is Ffarmers (i.e. Farmers - but if it were spelt that way it would
be said "Varmers"). Even though our address is in Harford the nearest
village is actually Ffaldybrenin, which means "The King's Sheepfold" - the
actual sheepfold it is named after still exists and is attached to a nearby
churchyard. :-)

Erw Wen has a large stand of spruce which, we are told, used to supply most
of the gateposts in the valley. It still supplies some of ours. :-) Also,
we have the original deeds, written on vellum.
