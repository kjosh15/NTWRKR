Geoff,

There's a risk that there will be a lot of waste on 12x12 sheets because
the body panels and lids only fit one to a sheet and there's not enough
remaining space to fit other parts into. I.e., the acrylic cost could be
high.

Just to verify, do you mean that the makerspace "12 inch cutters" have
12x12 beds? Because that seems very odd - 12x20 or 12x24 would be more
typical. Put another way, if they are 12xsomething else, then this is a lot
more viable.

Let us know!

Thanks,
Josh
