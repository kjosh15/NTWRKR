We now have two bisected sheep heads in our freezer for the ravens. I went
out with my youngest to shovel snow today and one was is a tall spar
outside our house. He gave me some loud attention calls as soon as we
stepped out, so I went straight back in and then brought out some blood
sausage. He made several fly-overs but didn't land as my son and I were
still nearby shoveling - but I saw they land to feed yesterday and am
confident they'll be back. Stoked to have this starting!!!
