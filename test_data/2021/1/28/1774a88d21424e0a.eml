Ah, I see it now. Sorry- thought you were being contacted directly by that
dude. I skipped checking the group for a couple of days because it had been
silent as a tomb for a week, and those are the days that there was new
activity. Durp.

Man, you seem to be dealing with an odd amount of animal blood and guts and
heads and fat. What are you doing over there?

'Stella and Chewy' is a good brand of freeze dried pet food. They do fish
and poultry and red meat (beef, rabbit, venison) versions. They're also
made with bones and organ meat so probably it's right up your alley. You
could break these into reward-sized chunks for the Crowbox.

There's gotta be plenty of other brands of freeze dried dog/cat meat. I
reckon this would be pretty stable in the reward basket. Might take on some
humidity from the air but as long as the food basket stayed mostly dry,
you'd probably be able to avoid fouling of the food. Dunno how Ravens would
think of crispy freeze-dried meat. I don't know how they tell what's what
when they can't smell.

Do you have a Crowbox right now? I seem to remember you were recalling
yours from NYC. I don't think you'd need anything more than those foam
weather strips we discussed to soak up some of the impact energy of those
fat ass Ravens plopping down on it.
