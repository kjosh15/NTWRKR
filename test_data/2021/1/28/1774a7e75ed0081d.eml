Awesome! I'll start designing a bisected sheep head dispenser!  :D

Great news, though. I bet you'll have no trouble attracting those ravens
with grody blood sausage and sheep heads. They might get pissed when you
switch to peanuts. Or wait, you're going to do meat rewards, right? Diced
blood sausage or something like that?

Hey, please confirm with me that you're going to get back in touch with
that user and confirm the size of the laser cutter he has access to. He
said 12 inch which makes a person think he means 12x12 inch. We need the
exact bed/sheet size of that cutter so that if I go to re-nest the parts I
can lay them out at the proper size.
