Had another good conversation with an investor tonight. The pitch is
getting smoother and I'm figuring out where we really need to dial it in to
address concerns.

This investor isn't right for us (too big) but he knows three seed funders
he thinks could be interested and will pass us along with a recommendation.

That said, two things that came up big was a) the lack of big corporate
logos, and b) evidence around how we're going to land the next ten big
corporate clients.

The latter we can tell a story around (mostly by having case studies to
convince them), but for the former I realized we could possibly ask Bechtel
and Elsevier if we could use their logos/names in private
conversations with investors. As long as it's not publicly shared I think
Bechtel at least might be game - what do you think?

Onward!
