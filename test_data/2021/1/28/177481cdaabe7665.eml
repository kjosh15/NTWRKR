Josh,

I apologize for the delay in our response! Our normal turnaround times are much quicker, but lately we have been experiencing a higher volume of requests than usual.

And, thank you for those traceroute results! However, I see that you've only sent 5 "hops" from each traceroute, and since the traces can easily run into 20 hops, there isn't enough data to get an idea of whether or not there's a problem.

Can you please run a full traceroute to each address, then copy and paste the results in a reply here? If you see more than 3 lines with only * * *, press Ctrl-C and then copy and paste it here, as that will mean the traceroutes aren't enabled at those hops.

Please let us know if you have any questions!

For further assistance, please contact us by replying to this support request through the Media Temple Account Center, or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you!

Best regards,

Eain B.
