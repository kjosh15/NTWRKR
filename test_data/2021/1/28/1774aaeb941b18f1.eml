Thanks, Jerry. I reviewed your site - you've got a lot going on!! A few
points of potential impact:

- I've done a fair bit of work around data and privacy issues, both with
the US Intelligence community and in my own work, along with some
potentially relevant work around sensor tech. (My wife and I RFID tagged my
family's clothing and monitored it all through our apartment for 3 months
to surface behavior-changing insights). Thought this might be relevant to
your senior housing work.

- Reg. the New York Academy of Sciences, their Open Innovation Challenges
are super appealing, not least because a lot of my retainer work is to
senior level executives who are all trying to figure out how to make the
most of the potential global recovery. Talent, JV, CVC, and M&A are all
top-of-mind topics around innovation in technology and sciences
specifically. How are you positioning these for accessibility to large
corporations?

- On the Smart Cities front, I'm curious if you've spoken to Patri Friedman
about is Pronomos <http://www.pronomos.vc/> smart city fund
<http://www.pronomos.vc>?

Plenty of other overlap; let me know if you think a brief call would be
useful. If so, my cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest
something that works for you GMT!

All best,
Josh
