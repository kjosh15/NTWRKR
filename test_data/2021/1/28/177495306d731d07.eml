Gene,

We have a problem. I see that Brio billed us $525 without notification on
Jan 18th. The reason I asked if we were still covered in our last email
thread is that we're closing all our US service accounts now that we've
moved to Iceland - I was hoping for your counsel on our stock allocation
before the last payment expired. How can we resolve this?

Much thanks,
Josh
