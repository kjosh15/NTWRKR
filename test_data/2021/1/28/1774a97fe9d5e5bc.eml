Swear to god the blood and fat and such is just local culture. Almost no
vegetables to speak of so meat is what keeps people alive.

OK, that didn't sound any better when I tried to explain it...

Freeze dried sounds like a good bet, but I bet cheap dog food will work as
well. We'll see what the store has when I get my crowbox - I'm still
waiting for the principle at the school to find it, and then I have to get
some friends to pick it up, and then I have to get it shipped. So, it'll be
a while. In the meantime I'm just habituating the ravens and getting them
to be comfortable feeding closer to the house - the dam that powers this
place is just down the hill from the house and has a roof that ought to
work nicely along with power outlets inside... but it hums constantly, so I
expect it's going to take some doing to get these birds comfortable setting
down there. Ravens are still widely hunted in Iceland.
