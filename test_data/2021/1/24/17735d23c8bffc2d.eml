people in my group to get an initial read on that question?  Thanks =

Jaron,

Long time no speak - we met at a SHARP government event back in 2009, =
then were reintroduced a couple times since (such as by Rachel Hanig).

I've been working on a TV series treatment using GPT-3 to engage people =
via chat on divisive issues. In each conversation it attempts to change =
their minds. The show itself focuses on the unexpected things that =
people respond to in order to highlight how human beings are manipulated =
by technology without knowing it.=20

We're looking for an Executive Producer who can speak to how technology =
- and particularly high-touch, high-scale, "learning" tech like GPT-3 - =
can impact us in unintended ways. I've attached our treatment; is this =
of any interest?

All best wishes,
Josh
