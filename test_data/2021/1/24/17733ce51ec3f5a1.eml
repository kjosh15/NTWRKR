Jaron,

Long time no speak - we met at a SHARP government event back in 2009, then
were reintroduced a couple times since (such as by Rachel Hanig).

I've been working on a TV series treatment using GPT-3 to engage people via
chat on divisive issues. In each conversation it attempts to change their
minds. The show itself focuses on the unexpected things that people respond
to in order to highlight how human beings are manipulated by technology
without knowing it.

We're looking for an Executive Producer who can speak to how technology -
and particularly high-touch, high-scale, "learning" tech like GPT-3 - can
impact us in unintended ways. I've attached our treatment; is this of any
interest?

All best wishes,
Josh
