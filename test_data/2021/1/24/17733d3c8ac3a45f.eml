Went back through this again this morning and actually really like it. Not
that I think it's the holy grail of D&I, but it IS cogent, measurable, and
observable. I.e., it's a much better place to start and build from than
most of the solutions I've heard about so far.

W50's D&I group pushed back a few weeks (they're apparently having an
internal re-org - huzzah!) but this topic continues to be top of discussion
all over the place. Let's touch on this tomorrow to see if we can advance
it at all or if we want to start with this going forward.
