Penske <http://pensketruckrental.com> had some better priced truck options =
(
pensketruckrental.com).

If you do a quote note that it's about 50 miles there and 50 miles back. Do
you think the 10" truck would work? Also, note there are a bunch of
optional insurances; did you want to take any of these on? I didn't hit
buy, but it looks like we could reserve something for tomorrow.

Almost there - thanks again, Gustavo!!

All best,
Josh
