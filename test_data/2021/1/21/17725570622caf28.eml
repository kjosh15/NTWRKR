FWIW here are another two interesting recent articles that might point at
different-than-expected futures for our group:


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-plans-online-payment-rules-105342219.h=
tml

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/biden-treasury-pick-yellen-favo=
rs-new-restrictions-on-cryptocurrency/

Worth sharing with the team?
