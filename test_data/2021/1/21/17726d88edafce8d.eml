Hey Mollie!

Firstly, I hope you're safe and healthy. What a year!!

Secondly, thanks for the note about Foundry. Sounds like there's a real
story there...

Thirdly, over the course of the pandemic I ran two personal experiments.
One or the other *might* be worth a book; can you give me a reality check?
They are:

a) I launched a mailing outreach campaign using some basic marketing tools
to everyone I've ever emailed with, and it's created an unbelievable amount
of serendipity (and business) - all virtually, and all automated in the
background... and I don't think I'll ever turn it off.

b) I built a personal strategy for the second half of my life, ("The Next
Half") starting with when I die and working backwards. That's helped me
make career and personal decisions and created an incredible amount of
clarity around what I want from both - in a framework that's made it easy
to respond to all the uncertainty the pandemic has created.

Do either of those sound at all interesting?

Finally, let me know if a call just to catch up sounds like fun - we're in
Iceland now!

All best wishes,
Josh
