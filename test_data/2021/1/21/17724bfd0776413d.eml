Thought you might find this interesting as we discuss future possible
projects; it has a nice intersection with the Telomere house concept!

Hi Josh,
Great talking with you yesterday! Always fun chatting about new cool
technologies.

Here=E2=80=99s a Google doc
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-sPhEC1-ybU1HhjzI5MLST5EAUpIz8yJRdr9D=
7JOS4/edit?usp=3Dsharing>
describing
the Personal Science Investment Fund we discussed. The original was
pre-COVID and needs lots of updating, but the basics are simple:


   - A fund making $10K-$500K angel-sized investments in people and very
   early product ideas related to health tech
   - All products are wrapped into a dashboard-type app (
   https://personalscience.com) that makes it easy for early users to test
   how well the products work. Our portfolio companies focus on their scien=
ce;
   we focus on proving it with the first customers.
   - Investors get insider pre-launch access to whatever cool gadgets or
   diagnostics we find.


It=E2=80=99s an investment fund centered around a software platform that tr=
eats
clinical trials like Agile development, with an emphasis on fast, iterative
deployment. There=E2=80=99s a network effect too, because more products mea=
ns more
data, which gives new insights to old data, and makes users more engaged
and interested in ever newer products. It=E2=80=99s called =E2=80=9Cpersona=
l science=E2=80=9D
because it brings research lab-style science to normal people.

Feel free to forward to whoever you think might be interested in helping
flesh it out into something real.  I=E2=80=99m personally very excited abou=
t
developing the software to enable this, but I=E2=80=99d want to be working =
with
somebody with experience in venture funds.  With the right combination of
people, this could very cool!
