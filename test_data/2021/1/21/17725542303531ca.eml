It's 2021. Is everything all better yet?

Let me know if you're game for a brief call to catch up; I'm now the
official host of the new flagship podcast for Accenture and I don't know
WTF that means and could use some advice. Also, if you ever wanted to come
to Iceland we're now living in a massive farmhouse here and are open to
visitors.

My cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest something that works
GMT - looking forward to catching up!
