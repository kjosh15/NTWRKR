Oscar,

I am still a U.S. citizen, and I will be working on this project out of
Akureyri, Iceland. Does that change anything and/or does it help generate
any insight into best options?

Thanks!
Josh

The Team Companies, who initially said that it could be possible to pay a

on every question and scenario you raised with the paymasters to see what

they are able to pay you. I can only suggest the options that are given to

payments<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Oscar,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#3=
9;m trying to figure out how to solve this issue. As my LLC is not a C or S=
 corp it sounds as though there are only two options:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=
=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do you have any plans to convert your current U.S. LLC =
into a U.S. LLC with a S or C Corp tax classification?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) P=
ay to talent as an individual subject to individual tax withholdings and wh=
ere Accenture would pay employer payroll taxes. In this case would I be an =
employee of Accenture, and if so could it pay me directly as an individual =
in Iceland? Payment will be issued by the paymaster vendor, Extreme Reach. =
If they pay you as an individual, they=E2=80=99ll need pay you as a U.S. pe=
rson with your social security number and Extreme Reach will act as the emp=
loyer of record for payroll purposes. Let me know if that=E2=80=99s what yo=
u meant or is your question about if they can deliver the payment to you in=
 Iceland?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2) Pay me via my UK company. Pursuant this, on De=
c 22, 2020, 9:03 PM you said:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I aske=
d Extreme Reach about this new UK entity question and unfortunately they ar=
en=E2=80=99t able to pay the UK entity. =C2=A0<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =C2=A0<br>&g=
t;<br>&gt; &quot;We just need to ensure that the payroll vendor can submit =
payments to a new potential entity (we=E2=80=99ll forward you the payment p=
aperwork the payroll vendor will need); that payments to the potential enti=
ty doesn=E2=80=99t expose Accenture to unkown tax risk liability; and that =
it=E2=80=99s your company authorized to lend out your services.&quot; Yes, =
agreed, the payroll vendor can submit payments to a new entity if it=E2=80=
=99s a U.S entity with an S or C Corp tax classification. In good faith we =
checked with another paymaster vendor, The Team Companies, who initially sa=
id that it could be possible to pay a foreign entity and then gave us more =
information that it would require our agency and Accenture to take on regul=
atory tax responsibility because they could not for the foreign payment. Un=
fortunately, we aren=E2=80=99t able to take on unknown risk and we work wit=
h these vendors so they can take care of all regulatory issues.<br>&gt;<br>=
&gt; I have a UK entity that is authorized to lend out my services, clearly=
 Accenture has worked with UK companies before and thereby suffers no unkno=
wn tax risk liability, and on our call on Friday, December 18, 2020 you con=
firmed that the payroll vendor is willing to send payments to a foreign ent=
ity, without the workman&#39;s comp.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As per the good faith =
agreement you confirmed in that same email we now need to get payment resol=
ved. Do you have any suggestions other than or regarding the above, and/or =
would it help if you were to speak to my UK company&#39;s CFO? Yes, agreed,=
 I would like to get payment resolved ASAP because we need the paperwork we=
 requested from you in order to issue payment and that process is now delay=
ed. In good faith I have been checking on every question and scenario you r=
aised with the paymasters to see what is possible and in compliance and hav=
e relayed to you their feedback on how they are able to pay you. I can only=
 suggest the options that are given to me by the vendor we work with in ord=
er to ensure regulatory compliance as well asking you above if there are an=
y plans to convert your current LLC to a C or S Corp tax classification. I =
can speak with your CFO if you=E2=80=99d like but I can=E2=80=99t speak to =
tax law and will only be able to relay the information I=E2=80=99ve been sh=
