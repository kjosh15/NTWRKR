Oscar,

Thanks for your help in chasing down these answers. I'll summarize below to
simplify:

1) The only available options are:

a) Convert my sole-proprietor LLC to an S- or C-corp,
b) Accept payment to my sole-proprietor LLC, with Extreme Reach withholding
self-employment taxes,
c) Accept payment as an individual employee of Extreme Reach, with them
withholding employee taxes.

One other options I'm exploring is creating a C-corp LLC subsidiary for my
UK-based LLC, but I don't think that is a good option as it's likely to
take a good chunk of time to establish. Do I have the above right?

2) My question about being paid as an individual was whether I could be
paid as an individual in Iceland, in which case I would know what the tax
burden was. It sounds as though this is not an option however, is that
correct?

3) The difficulty is that I cannot anywhere find a clear answer on what the
tax implications of any of those above choices are. I have asked Deloitte,
KPMG, PwC, three different tax experts here in Iceland, and two in the US.
All of them have said there would likely be significant tax implications,
but none of them have explained how/why/what. Nowhere online is there a
clear answer about US tax law, especially in the materials provided by the
IRS.

This means that I am looking at paying an unknown amount of tax of between
~40-80%, which just doesn't make any sense.

Is there anyone at Accenture that could advise on this? I would think it'd
be an area that *someone* there would have some expertise on! If we could
just find out what % tax is due for each of the options above we could make
a decent decision about which allows for a reasonable tax burden and could
move on with this!

Much obliged,
Josh

I have a UK entity that is authorized to lend out my services, clearly Acce=
nture has worked with UK companies before and thereby suffers no unknown ta=
x risk liability, and on our call on Friday, December 18, 2020 you confirme=
d that the payroll vendor is willing
 to send payments to a foreign entity, without the workman&#39;s comp. <br>
<br>
As per the good faith agreement you confirmed in that same email we now nee=
d to get payment resolved. Do you have any suggestions other than or regard=
ing the above, and/or would it help if you were to speak to my UK company&#=
39;s CFO?<span style=3D"color:rgb(31,73,125)">
</span><span style=3D"color:red">Yes, agreed, I would like to get payment r=
esolved ASAP because we need the paperwork we requested from you in order t=
o issue payment and that process is now delayed. In good faith I have been =
checking on every question and scenario
 you raised with the paymasters to see what is possible and in compliance a=
nd have relayed to you their feedback on how they are able to pay you. I ca=
n only suggest the options that are given to me by the vendor we work with =
in order to ensure regulatory compliance
 as well asking you above if there are any plans to convert your current LL=

=80=99d like but I can=E2=80=99t speak to tax law and will only be able to =

I&#39;m not clear on the liability issue; can you help me understand this b=
etter? The reason I ask is that I know Accenture contracts people and organ=
izations internationally. Put another way, if the problem is Iceland per se=
, I also have a company based in the
 UK that&#39;s doing significant business (licensed, insured, etc.) that I =
could receive payment through. Would that be more suitable?<u></u><u></u></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Again, the concern here is that if self employment a=
nd SS withholdings are applied in NYC, they will also be applied in Iceland=
, resulting in an additional ~35-40% taxes on top
 of the regular tax base here of ~38%. I&#39;m not hugely confident that ei=
ther country would happily refund these afterwards.<br>

I was trying to disentangle the payment issue and was wondering if you&#39;=
