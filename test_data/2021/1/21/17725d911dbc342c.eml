Josh,

Thank you for contacting us.

Unfortunately, the error that you've reported is somewhat normal, basically saying that a login attempt was blocked successfully.  This shouldn't be a concern though, we are monitoring our systems for malicious traffic or other problems.

To view your logs with cli , log in with SSH with the Server Admin credentials:

Host: s44066.gridserver.com
User: changeh4xindustries.com
Set or reset the password here:  AccountCenter > OVERVIEW > ADMIN > Server Admin Password & SSH

Once you're logged in, do this command to get to the logs folder:

cd ../../logs

I hope this answers all of your questions, and we are here anytime to answer any other questions you may have.

Best regards,

James T.
