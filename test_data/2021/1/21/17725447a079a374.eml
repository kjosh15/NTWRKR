Firstly, I hope this email finds you and yours safe and well!

We were introduced by Mattias Ljungman way back in 2009, when I read your
thesis on Positive Job Fit. A lot has changed since then, but most
saliently I founded Indigometrics.com, the Google Analytics of Workplace
Behavior. It's a SaaS platform + expert system for data to measure and
manage behavior in the workplace. Then COVID happened, the workplace became
distributed, and we blew up.

Now we have 18 customers, including two large (>35k employee) multinational
customers with four more similarly sized clients in the pipeline. We've
also got a pending study with Wharton's People Analytics group and a
potential Diversity and Inclusion initiative with >500 companies spanning
the S&P as part of World 50/g100.

We need capital to support this growth. The prerequisite deck is attached
and a video is available here <https://indigometrics.com/investors/>
(Login: investor5 / Pword: j@Xald4$uPogG); we think Acceleprise.vc would be
an ideal partner given its focus on the enterprise, with potential
synergies to investments like peopledatalabs.com. Do you think it warrants
a follow up call to reconnect?

All best wishes,
Josh
