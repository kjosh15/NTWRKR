Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support. 

The Grid Service does have certain outgoing limitations in place:

DOES MY SERVER HAVE OUTGOING EMAIL LIMITATIONS?

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204403814/does-my-server-have-outgoing-email-limitations

Also keep in mind that if you have email forwarders setup to forward to your own internal addresses that will count as additional sending also. 

There is also the possibility that users on the server may be sending spam resulting in the flag you are seeing. 

This guide will outline the steps for checking your server:
