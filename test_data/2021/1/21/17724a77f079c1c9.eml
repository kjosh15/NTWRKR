fine if we can do 70/30 vs 80/20. That said, can you help me understand bet=

arly, what else is there then &quot;the aggregate of the fixed compensation=
 (e.g., producer fees and production company fees) and contingent compensat=
ion (e.g., profit participation)&quot;? Also, how would you manage a greate=

this is to be a significant part of this project&#39;s financing? (I ask kn=

put in some rough language around rights, but would like to get a better ha=
