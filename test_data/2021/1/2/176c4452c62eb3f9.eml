So we spoke to the owner of the farm here and it turns out she's pro-raven
(not Icelanders are). We started putting out food today and have staked out
a location that's within extension cord's reach of the barn. :)

Next step is to figure out what they could gather - I'm inclined to use
coins just to keep it consistent, but think we could have a big impact on
the local fan base if we could figure out a way for them to gather scraps
of white plastic. The landscape is dotted with haybales wrapped in said
plastic, and scraps of it are a major pollutant.

Regardless, first step is to see if they'll come regularly. Then I'll need
to figure out how to get a box here and set up to accommodate such large
birds!!

Wanted to update you regardless as I'm stoked about the possibility of
actually operating a box myself!!

- J
