That's got to be a hard decision to make; IIR you did a ton to get that tug
set up just right!! But it sounds like you're right; it's just not the
right boat for where you are now.

That said, an RV could be a similar cool project. I've had it on my
wishlist to refurb an airstream for years now; the shells apparently
survive anything and are hugely forgiving of customization. What were you
thinking of getting?
