Just a heads up:

Spent much of this afternoon digging through signal.nfx.com and then
building a conformed and unified tracking sheet for our targets. This
brings us closer to ~200 targets with a direct connection. (About 15-30 of
those are either second degree LinkedIn targets in our area, or direct
contacts outside our area).

I've still got to do the research to fill in the holes, but this is good
validation that we have plenty of direct connections to VCs in our area and
that we can qualify them appropriately in terms of check size, area of
interest, and references.
