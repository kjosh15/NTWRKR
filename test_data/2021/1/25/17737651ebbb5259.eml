Dear Josh and Hulda,
Please forgive the late reply.  I'm so happy to hear that real life has
returned in Iceland and it seems very sensible that you would stay there
for the sake of a normal life!  I will ask Josh whether we need to withdraw
your children's names from our register.  It would be wonderful if they
could return to Ella Baker when the time is right.

I will follow up about DOE official next steps, if there are any.  For now,
I'll inform teachers they can take Othinn and Haakon off their classroom
rosters.  More soon.

I can't thank you enough for your support and your offer of continued
support.  We wish you much happiness over there.  NY will be back, but
frankly it's not back yet.

Warm regards,
Betsy
