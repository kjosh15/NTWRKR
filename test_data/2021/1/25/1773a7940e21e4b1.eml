Thanks, Beth!! We finally acknowledged to Betsy that our kids are full time
in face-to-face school here in Iceland and are getting more and more
involved in after-school activities and sports and less-and-less in the
virtual offerings from EB. We still pine for NYC, but won't be back this
year.

Thanks so much for thinking of us and for the invite - we hope to be
involved again in the future!! How are you all doing?!?

All best,
Josh
