I hear you; I don't know if it's the weather, the pandemic, or what but
this winter has been quiet. I was bummed not to see more of a response on
the power bank stuff also.

That said, we've seen our work have a slow burn before, so let's not throw
anything out yet. I still think our strategy of doubling down on our own
results in our respective locations is our best bet.

Things here are ... snowy. As in, the bottom floor of our house is snowed
under. Had to haul my two kids on sleds a half k to meet the school bus,
which is actually an arctic exploration van. Strange times. You?
