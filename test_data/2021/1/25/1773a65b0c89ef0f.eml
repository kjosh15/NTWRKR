Hey dude how are things?

Not much going on in the group; Your offer of assistance fell mostly quiet.
We did hear from Derrick, who fixed his shiz. We have Viscouse going, also,
but it looks like he's still trying to attract corvids to his site.

We should circle back with that dude we had to mail a servo to late last
year. We could see where he is with his project.

I need to get a box of my own built in the next month or two if I can. So I
can deploy this spring and try getting my site running, too. I should start
peanutting before then and see if I can get any of those flyover crows to
stop for a minute. I still see them, I saw three yesterday and it was 22
degrees here.

Let me know if I can be doing anything else. I need to cut the 12V power
video but I got de-motivated a bit when it seemed that there wasn't a lot
of interest in the power bank information and video we published. I
expected that to be very exciting for folks.

Hope all is well!

-Steve
