All right so.... one last question:
My understanding is:

Crows are experimenters. Hackers, if you will, who can innovate to =E2=80=9C=
optimize=E2=80=9D a reward system...observe the actions of others. Teach oth=
ers in their peer group about new findings, improve group success rates.

So, a barcode is read just straight across. It=E2=80=99s one dimensional, li=
near. It is a machine-readable font. A QR code is read in two dimensions and=
 multiple levels: x, y, black, white, transposed with data re: grid regions,=
 etc. It=E2=80=99s a code read in two dimensions, with a superimposed third d=
imension of metadata.

So, what=E2=80=99s the QR code of an object in free fall? A species at a spe=
cific life phase? In a specific and somewhat controlled environment? In eith=
er our visible spectrum or UV light? What about orientation - think: when yo=
u put credit card in reader, it has to face a specific direction or it won=E2=
=80=99t work. The same could be said of an insect - the wings on the top sid=
e are patterned differently than the opposite underside. There=E2=80=99s a n=
atural symmetry to all organic life. That feels like a code that can be read=
......

I=E2=80=99ll let you know what I find out.
