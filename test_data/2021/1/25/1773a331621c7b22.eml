Spoke to their head and he was very engaged. We're looking for more cash
than they could support, but they'd definitely like to sign in as a
follow-on investor if an institutional took the lead. He's digging into it
to see if it's something his seed fund could sign on.

Overall I thought he asked good questions and seemed pleased with our
answers. His focus is on B2B SaaS so this was good validation. Moreover, if
we need to, we can go back to him and make a pitch for a smaller amount of
cash for a smaller % of the company to bridge the gap between now and our
cash flow in lieu of taking institutional investment.

Onward! Definitely getting the pitch refined, which feels great.
