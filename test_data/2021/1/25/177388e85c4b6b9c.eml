Just checking in to see what ER said reg. your double check. If they have
no alternatives the only immediate option is to pay me as an individual; if
we were to do that today would we be able to continue pursuing a better
solution going forward? I ask as I'm about to engage a service that
specializes in international tax law who may be able to help suggest best
practices.

If the latter, I'll need to know whether to put my Icelandic or US address
on the paperwork you sent.

&gt; Hi, Josh:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks. This is definitely a unique scenario that we haven=E2=80=99t e=
ncountered before so happy to have brought back questions to Extreme Reach.=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Extreme Reach has shared the attached with respect to paying loan out =
companies. Hopefully this helps. I can set up a call with us and Extreme Re=
ach for tomorrow if you think that would help.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; To clarify from the email chain below, Extreme Reach says they can pay=
 in one of two ways:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) =C2=A0 =C2=A0 If Extreme Reach is paying to an S or C corp tax iden=
tification U.S. Loan out company LLC or Corporation that talent is an offic=
er of, and we would need the following documents from you: =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=B7 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Form W-9; and<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=B7 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Form I-9<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) =C2=A0 =C2=A0 If Extreme Reach is paying to you as an individual in=
 your name subject to U.S. Form W-4 withholdings, ER would need the followi=
ng forms: =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=B7 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Form W-4; and<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=B7 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Form I-9<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The above are the options given to me by Extreme of how they can issue=
 payment to talent. This is also how we=E2=80=99ve always paid talent. Unfo=
rtunately, the other methods we inquired are not viable with Extreme Reach =
to issue payment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For our understanding can you confirm you are still a U.S. citizen?<br=
>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Will you be working on this project out of Reykjav=C3=ADk, Iceland or =
another city?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have to submit your above paperwork by this coming Monday morning NY=
 time, January 25th in order for Extreme Reach to be able to issue payment =
on time. If we aren=E2=80=99t able to resolve by this coming Monday, I=E2=
=80=99ll raise the issue to the client asap and payment
 to you will be delayed.<br>
&gt;<br>

ions.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Oscar,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for your help in chasing down these answers. I&#39;ll summarize=
 below to simplify:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) The only available options are:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; a) Convert my sole-proprietor LLC to an S- or C-corp,<br>
&gt; b) Accept payment to my sole-proprietor LLC, with Extreme Reach withho=
lding self-employment taxes,<br>
&gt; c) Accept payment as an individual employee of Extreme Reach, with the=
m withholding employee taxes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; One other options I&#39;m exploring is creating a C-corp LLC subsidiar=
y for my UK-based LLC, but I don&#39;t think that is a good option as it&#3=
9;s likely to take a good chunk of time to establish. Do I have the above r=
ight? I re-shared in my email above the ways in
 which Extreme Reach can issue payment and the attached PDF for loan out co=
mpanies. I asked ER about the UK based LLC and they said they can=E2=80=99t=
 pay a UK based LLC. However, I=E2=80=99m happy to bring back more informat=
ion of what you mean here for ER to review to let
 us know if this is a viable option.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) My question about being paid as an individual was whether I could b=
e paid as an individual in Iceland, in which case I would know what the tax=
 burden was. It sounds as though this is not an option however, is that cor=
rect? ER notified me that they can
 issue a wire bank payment to your bank account or send you a check in Icel=
and subject to the payment methods above.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3) The difficulty is that I cannot anywhere find a clear answer on wha=
t the tax implications of any of those above choices are. I have asked Delo=
itte, KPMG, PwC, three different tax experts here in Iceland, and two in th=
e US. All of them have said there would
 likely be significant tax implications, but none of them have explained ho=
w/why/what. Nowhere online is there a clear answer about US tax law, especi=
ally in the materials provided by the IRS.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This means that I am looking at paying an unknown amount of tax of bet=
ween ~40-80%, which just doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Is there anyone at Accenture that could advise on this? I would think =
it&#39;d be an area that *someone* there would have some expertise on! If w=
e could just find out what % tax is due for each of the options above we co=
uld make a decent decision about which
 allows for a reasonable tax burden and could move on with this! I think yo=
u=E2=80=99re asking about what % tax you will owe for the two ways in which=
 ER can issue payment. If as an individual in your name, ER will withhold b=
ased on your completed U.S Form W-4. For
 your tax liability if ER pays to a U.S. C or S Corp tax classification loa=
n out or regarding any international taxes, we suggest you speak with your =
personal accountant. I=E2=80=99ve emailed Extreme Reach again on this to ch=
eck again so if they for any reason have
 new info I will let you know.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Oscar,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to figure out how to solve this issue. As my LLC is not=
 a C or S corp it sounds as though there are only two options:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Do you have any plans to convert your current U.S. LLC into a U.S. LLC=
 with a S or C Corp tax classification?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) Pay to talent as an individual subject to individual tax withholdin=
gs and where Accenture would pay employer payroll taxes. In this case would=
 I be an employee of Accenture, and if so could it pay me directly as an in=
dividual in Iceland? Payment will be
 issued by the paymaster vendor, Extreme Reach. If they pay you as an indiv=
idual, they=E2=80=99ll need pay you as a U.S. person with your social secur=
ity number and Extreme Reach will act as the employer of record for payroll=
 purposes. Let me know if that=E2=80=99s what you
 meant or is your question about if they can deliver the payment to you in =
Iceland?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) Pay me via my UK company. Pursuant this, on Dec 22, 2020, 9:03 PM y=
ou said:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I asked Extreme Reach about this new UK entity question and unfortunat=
ely they aren=E2=80=99t able to pay the UK entity. =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &quot;We just need to ensure that the payroll vendor can submit paymen=
ts to a new potential entity (we=E2=80=99ll forward you the payment paperwo=
rk the payroll vendor will need); that payments to the potential entity doe=
sn=E2=80=99t expose Accenture to unkown tax risk liability;
 and that it=E2=80=99s your company authorized to lend out your services.&q=
uot; Yes, agreed, the payroll vendor can submit payments to a new entity if=
 it=E2=80=99s a U.S entity with an S or C Corp tax classification. In good =
faith we checked with another paymaster vendor, The Team
 Companies, who initially said that it could be possible to pay a foreign e=
ntity and then gave us more information that it would require our agency an=
d Accenture to take on regulatory tax responsibility because they could not=
 for the foreign payment. Unfortunately,
 we aren=E2=80=99t able to take on unknown risk and we work with these vend=
ors so they can take care of all regulatory issues.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have a UK entity that is authorized to lend out my services, clearly=
 Accenture has worked with UK companies before and thereby suffers no unkno=
wn tax risk liability, and on our call on Friday, December 18, 2020 you con=
firmed that the payroll vendor is willing
 to send payments to a foreign entity, without the workman&#39;s comp.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As per the good faith agreement you confirmed in that same email we no=
w need to get payment resolved. Do you have any suggestions other than or r=
egarding the above, and/or would it help if you were to speak to my UK comp=
any&#39;s CFO? Yes, agreed, I would like
 to get payment resolved ASAP because we need the paperwork we requested fr=
om you in order to issue payment and that process is now delayed. In good f=
aith I have been checking on every question and scenario you raised with th=
e paymasters to see what is possible
 and in compliance and have relayed to you their feedback on how they are a=
ble to pay you. I can only suggest the options that are given to me by the =
vendor we work with in order to ensure regulatory compliance as well asking=
 you above if there are any plans
 to convert your current LLC to a C or S Corp tax classification. I can spe=
ak with your CFO if you=E2=80=99d like but I can=E2=80=99t speak to tax law=
 and will only be able to relay the information I=E2=80=99ve been sharing w=
ith you. Let me know if you would still like me to speak
 with your CFO or discuss by phone and if you have any questions.<br>

&gt; I hope all is well. We=E2=80=99re off today for the MLK holiday but wa=

 In order to be tax compliant, the paymaster services companies inform me t=
hat they can either pay to talent as an individual subject to individual ta=

other option is to pay talent to
 a U.S. corporation or LLC where the talent is an officer of the entity and=
 the entity is a S or C Corp tax classification in which case the entity is=

&gt; Oscar,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m not clear on the liability issue; can you help me understand t=
his better? The reason I ask is that I know Accenture contracts people and =
organizations internationally. Put another way, if the problem is Iceland p=
er se, I also have a company based in the
 UK that&#39;s doing significant business (licensed, insured, etc.) that I =
could receive payment through. Would that be more suitable?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Again, the concern here is that if self employment and SS withholdings=
 are applied in NYC, they will also be applied in Iceland, resulting in an =
additional ~35-40% taxes on top of the regular tax base here of ~38%. I&#39=
;m not hugely confident that either country
 would happily refund these afterwards.<br>

&gt; Hi, Josh:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I hear you and, yes, agreed to hoping for a positive future moving for=
ward.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes, so the talent paymaster companies can pay U.S. LLCs and corporati=
ons with an S or C Corp. tax classification as loan out companies for talen=
t services where talent is an officer of that entity. The other form of pay=
ment is to pay talent as an individual
 subject to W-4 withholdings.=C2=A0 Paying an Icelandic entity isn=E2=80=99=
t possible because, as discussed, due to the unknown tax liability that it =
would place on Accenture.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I=E2=80=99ve asked the vendor to share the forms we need you to comple=
te for either scenario above. I should have these tomorrow.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank you!<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; Oscar,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Happy new year!! It&#39;s off to an interesting start, but here&#39;s =
hoping for big improvements.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was trying to disentangle the payment issue and was wondering if you=
&#39;d been able to ensure that the payroll vendor can submit payments to a=
 new potential entity (you were going to forward me the payment paperwork t=
he payroll vendor will need) and that payments
 to the potential Icelandic entity doesn=E2=80=99t expose Accenture to unkn=
own tax risk liability.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Let me know if you have any updates and/or if I can provide any furthe=
r info.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks!<br>
&gt; Josh<br>
