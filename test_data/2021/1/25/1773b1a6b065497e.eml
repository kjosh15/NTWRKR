Hey Josh!

It=E2=80=99s wonderful that the kids are able to be in school in person!  Wh=
at are the similarities and differences between public school in Iceland and=
 public school in NYC? What an amazing experience for them!

Hank started going to school part time in person (blended learning) and thin=
gs have been much better. Remote school has been really hard for him. I find=
 that limiting the amount of zoom school he is expected to participate in is=
 better.=20

Take care,
Beth=20
