I'm told this winter is milder than most. I think we are getting a dump
tonight or tomorrow. Only about a half inch on the ground right now.

Had a huge winter wind storm a little over a week ago. I looked at the barn
yesterday and it's all fucked up. The big bay doors blew out of their
tracks and the locks were pulled out, screws and all. These are two pairs
of huge 10 by 20 foot doors. Maybe I should have opened them for the storm,
I dunno.

I'll work some time into my schedule to shoot the 12v video. It's about the
same as the power bank one in terms of complexity. That is to say, pretty
easy.

Have fun sledding to the mailbox!
