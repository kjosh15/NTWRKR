Agreed that you should cut it down. Saying simply "We only know the Voltaic
to work - everything else we've tested has an auto shutoff feature" (or
similar) ought to do it. I agree there will doubtlessly be folks who buy
something thinking they know better but we can't stop them and would be
doing more than our due diligence in stressing the point. That's my $0.02,
anyway, but I defer to you here if you feel strongly more needs to be said!

BTW and FWIW, I'm super impressed that you tested 7 banks total. That's a
big investment in time and gear. Thanks!!

Looking forward to seeing the new video. You going to get your nails done
this time? (JK!)
