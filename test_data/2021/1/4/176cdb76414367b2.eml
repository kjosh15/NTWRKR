<https://perlan.is/spot-the-raven-in-iceland/?lang=en#:~:text=It%20has%20big%20powerful%20wings,(2%2D4.5%20lbs).>
:

It has big powerful wings with a wingspan of 100-150 cm (40-60 in). On the
ground, the raven often hops around galloping like other passerines. The
raven has strong feet, long claws, and a good grip. Its height is 60-75 cm
(24-30 in) and the weight is 1-2 kg (2-4.5 lbs). The male is usually a
little bigger than the female.

I hear you - getting corvids to collect garbage is by far the biggest
interest from folks interested in a box. But the problem, as ever, is how
to detect the results!! That said, you're absolutely right because if we
can train them to gather something that is a local problem it'd have a
potentially huge impact on local opinion - especially in Iceland!

To that end - yes, I THINK it's the strong thermal bond plastic bailing.

article seems to suggest it's made of polyethylene. I'm scheduling a call
with a local ornithologist with an interest in ravens to get some better
answers along with any tips or thoughts on a RavenBox deployment.

All best,
