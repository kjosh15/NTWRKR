I have everything I need now to shoot this stuff, including time. I wanted
to shoot today but I used my allotted time to do dry runs and refine the
narration.

My plan to put the GoPro through my lamp's light ring didn't work. So I
just had to improvise a setup using a GorillaPod and I'll have to shoot
from a lower angle than expected. It's alright, I'll be able to clearly
demonstrate the process, it will just be a different POV than the other
CrowBox videos. I wish I could shoot in my shop but it's cold as piss out
there and the heater is a big industrial warehouse type heater so it's too
noisy for a good video.

I did a bunch of dry runs with no recording today, just to sort of work out
all of the narrative content and figure out the things that are going to
jam me up. My biggest problem right now is that I keep going down a rathole
explaining the ALWAYS ON feature of power banks and again trying to make
sure folks understand they need the right power bank. I figure in the
actual video we have to make one more effort to explain that not all power
banks will work. More importantly, MOST power banks WON'T work.

I looked around today and there's still no one else standing up to say "YES
we make power banks with always on". Only Voltaic. There are forums where
photographers (mostly) go asking after always on power banks and people
respond in one of three ways, it seems:


1) Buy a Voltaic power bank.

2) Build a dummy load to make the circuit consume more power and thus keep
the power bank on. This is horrible because it means doubling the power
consumption of a Crowbox just to trick a power bank into not turning itself
off. Not a welcome solution at a time when we're talking about trying to
halve the current power consumption.

3) I bought a cheap "such and such" powerbank at Walmart/Amazon/Alibaba and
it stays on no matter how low the current goes. Many of these are followed
up by posts indicating that the manufacturers changed their circuitry and
now "such and such" powerbank won't stay on through low consumption events.

So, these last two options fucking suck. I think I'll suggest strongly that
folks go with what we have tested, and that's Voltaic brand banks. I can
tell them to look for power banks that have the "always on" feature but I
don't think they're going to have much luck finding one that's not from
Voltaic. That's enough for due diligence I reckon. I just worry that folks
will conclude on their own that "These are all the same" so they can
convince themselves to buy one they find on Amazon for half the price of a
Voltaic. I'll try to keep this part of the video short. In my dry run I
held one of each power bank and discussed why the standard bank doesn't
work and why the Voltaic does. I think I'm going to cut this part and just
get it down to "here's a Voltaic power bank, it has a crucial feature we
require and it's the only power bank we've tested that will continuously
power a Crowbox" [paraphrased].

So you know, I tested 7 power banks total. Six shut themselves off and the
Voltaic kept the Crowbox running.

But, the way my dry runs went today I'll spend about as much time talking
about power banks as demonstrating how to perform the conversion.

Do you agree that I should cut down on how much I talk about banks, or do
you feel the video that demonstrates how to perform the conversion should
also discuss the power banks in detail?
