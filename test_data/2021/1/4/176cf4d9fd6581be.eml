Alright, I'm going to take a wizz and then start cutting this first video
on the power banks. I think this will address the concerns of a lot of
users and I can take a little more time doing the 12 volt buck converter
video since there's less demand for that explanation.

I had my nails done, but I picked a sparkly polish and then decided that it
would be too distracting so I removed it and I'm going natural. In all
honesty, though, Dani's been making me put on this one particular lotion at
night since I'm going to be making a video. My hands were cracked and
bleeding from the winter conditions so she managed to clear that up for me.

At least I don't have a soldering iron burn on my left thumb this time.

So I reckon I'm going to get this recorded now and edited down this
evening. Do you want me to post it to the Crowbox YouTube channel before
you get a chance to sign off on it or do you want me to put it on Google
Drive for you to view and approve first?

-Steve
