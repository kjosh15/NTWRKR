Awesome news! What did you put out for food?

Did you say those Ravens are 4.6 pounds or 4.6 kilograms?

I'm super interested in training for other items. So is the rest of the
community, it seems. It makes good sense especially in a rural area where
there's unlikely to be much in the way of coins. Further interesting
because you're been able to identify a specific object that's a local
scourge.

Are you talking about strips of that super strong thermal-bond plastic
baling? The stuff that sometimes heavier cardboard boxes are bound with?
Furniture and shit like that?
