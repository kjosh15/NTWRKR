Simon,


Firstly, happy new year! I hope you and yours left 2020 well and healthy.
How are those lambs?!?


Secondly, we're onboarding our second large multinational and looking at
four more in the pipeline, and are getting hit with some
insurance questions I thought you might have a view on.


Our US customers are asking us to obtain insurance on an occurrence policy
form, not a claims made form. However professional liability insurance in
the UK seems to be only available on a claims made form (at least to
smaller companies). We can negotiate with each customer but at some point
we would like to be able to satisfy US customers in a more straightforward
way (by having insurance in place on an occurrence policy form).



Is there a standard way that small international companies like ours deal
with the US insurance challenge? Is it usual to set up a subsidiary in the
US just to hold a US insurance policy and if so what kind of sub is the
usual approach/



Very much obliged; let me know if a brief call would be easier!


All best,

Josh
