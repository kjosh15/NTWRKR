Asked around and was very curious to see that technologists tended to say
this looked very good... whereas a couple very politically involved
investors, activists, and marketers were hands-down against it.

Worse, their reticence was backed up by claims that open source software
was easier for hackers to get into, and that better paper ballots was well
known to be the first thing that needed fixing. I.e., misinformation
abounds.

Not sure how this feeds into your view of the platform, but it does clarify
for me that it may be a good solution with big potential... and a bad
market.

All best,
Josh
