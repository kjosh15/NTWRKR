Hey Josh! I'm so sorry I just noticed that I didn't actually add you to
this email that I sent from my work account! Would love to chat with you
and take this forward, I've cc'd my work email here as you can see I'm
terrible with personal email right now!

Looking forward to catching up!

Hey Josh!

So sorry about the slow response on my end, I saw this in my personal inbox
but then didn't do the thing of moving it to my work inbox quick enough!
Apologies for this really!

I'd love to chat with you more about what you're doing and the exact type
of person you're currently looking for. From what you've described all this
sounds very exciting. This is how we currently work with our partner
companies: https://www.recurse.com/hire. Let me know what works for your
calendar and I'd be happy to set up a quick 30min chat to go through some
of this with you.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Sonali
