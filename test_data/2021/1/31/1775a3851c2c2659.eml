Dunno about the drain field yet. All the tree pieces are gone so now I can
have a septic dude come look. Going to have to pump out the hole left by
the root ball and see if the drain field broke or if we're just looking at
stuff that came out of the drain field pipes and is waiting to drain down
into the soil below. The hole is full of brown water with a bit of foam. I
call it the world's worst latte. This could still just be mud and wash from
the water table, but the foam is suspicious.

Even if it is broken drain field, it's not that big of a deal to fix. At
least the hole is already 'dug'. Heh.

Fucking OSX Big Sur broke my CAD program, the one I use to do ALL of my
design work. So now I'm going to have to install it on a windows gaming
laptop I keep around expressly to run software that is only produced for
Windows. Until either Apple or Punch figures out how Big Sur broke ViaCad.
Otherwise I would already have pulled the guts out of the Crowbox model and
started looking at ways to contain those in a different housing. I'm not
going to know any of the hotkeys for windows. Ah well.

Another possibility is trying to source some off-the-shelf box-like plastic
product with the right measurements. Something like a small waste bin or
storage bin. But that sort of thing is unlikely to be available
internationally so this might not be the best approach.

I have a bunch of house shit to do today so I don't know if I'll get any of
this done today but mid-next week things are clearing up.

It looks like all of the commercial laser cutting houses have priced us
out. I don't know what happened. Maybe laser tubes got more expensive or
something. Acrylic did not go up in price. Maybe they're just dicks.

Our generator came in. They're dropping it here Wednesday and installing it
the following Wednesday. Which means I have to go out and shovel about 800
pounds of landscaping stones out of our beds so that I can find and
terminate all of the micro-irrigation lines that are under the generator's
install site. Then I have to put all the fuckers back afterwards. In
Woodinville we knew a guy who would do ANY kind of work for $25 an hour. I
wish he were here with us now!

I'll do what I can over the next week but I'll have distractions.
