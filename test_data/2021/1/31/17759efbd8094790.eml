I filed all my documents for a second draw PPP loan weeks ago, but I just
logged in again to check if there were any updates and under "SBA Loan -
Second Draw" there was a button to send it to the SBA for review.

I clicked it again, but had done first so weeks ago. Can you please confirm
that this was sent previously and the button was a bug? Would be very very
disappointed if I only just got put in the queue!!

Many thanks,
Josh
