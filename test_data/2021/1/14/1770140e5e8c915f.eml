Stephanie,

It turns out the US and Iceland have a double taxation agreement, meaning I
won't have to pay self employment taxes twice. Hazzah!

Given that, we think it makes the most sense to file according to what
actually happened - i.e., taxes in NYC for income from Jan 1 - June 15th,
2020 and taxes in Iceland from June 16th - Dec 31, 2020. That is:


### ICELAND (June 16th - Dec 31, 2020)

Income: $35,132.39
Taxes (50% estimated): $14,052.96

### NYC (Jan 1 - June 15th, 2020)

Income: $70,123 - 18,056.00 PPP loan =3D $52,067
Taxes (30% estimate): $17,355.66

### 2020 TOTAL INCOME:

$105,255.39 (including PPP loan)
$87,199.39 (PPP loan discounted)


I've got a breakdown of income below (sadly it's really simple). What do we
need to submit tomorrow? And do I have time to start pulling up some
deductibles? Right now we only have $20k in money saved for taxes, total. :=
/

Thanks!!
Josh

P.S. I'm still trying to figure out what to do about the contact I've
already signed with Accenture through my NYC LLC. For now, do you have
anyone you can suggest who might give me advice on the S-Corp vs. C-corp,
etc. issues?
