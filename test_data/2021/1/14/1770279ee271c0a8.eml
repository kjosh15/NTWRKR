1) I'll cut the video for 12V power when I can. We've had no electricity
for the past 36 hours. Big wind storm.

2) I need more information, but it sounds like DerekG in the group has
accidentally cemented some parts that are not supposed to be cemented. I'm
probably going to have to walk him through strategically breaking part of
his Crowbox to back out of a cementing error. If this happens, he'll need a
replacement part. I'll find out whether he cuts his own parts or if he
ordered them. If he cuts his own, I'll provide him with DXF geometry of
that single part. If he bought his kit from Ponoko, I will cut a
replacement for him myself and mail it. We'll know more after he replies to
what I posted this morning.

3) You know, Crowboxes could get a lot cheaper if we could sell kits or
parts at cost. For example, right now people have to buy way too many parts
(like a bag of 10 switches) to get 2 switches for their Crowbox. The only
safe way to do this would be to start a foundation. The Avian Intelligence
Institute or something. A legal entity that eliminates personal
liabilities. Then the users' cost of bulk parts could be greatly
subsidized. This would also provide a measure of control over parts (like
the springs we discussed) to ensure that all builders are using the correct
parts. Just something to think about, it's not a decision to be made
lightly.
