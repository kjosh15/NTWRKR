Priorities



A client, Craig, had a challenging task. After he completed it, he wrote:
"I really worked hard to pull all this together and was happy with the
results. I started work on this without delay; new for me. In the end, I
still ran out of time for the final edit. Luckily nothing terrible ended up
in there. Almost all of the heavy lifting was done days in advance. It was
hard for me to permit myself to work on this days before it was due despite
the obvious importance, but I did it; kept pushing away other urgent
projects."

I asked him to share this in the newsletter because I believe others can
benefit from how he described what he did. I want to highlight the
following in what he wrote:
 - "I started work on this without delay."
 - "Almost all of the heavy lifting was done days in advance."
 - "It was hard for me to give myself permission to work on this days
before it was due despite the obvious importance, but I did it; kept
pushing away other urgent projects."

The first two points are about avoiding procrastination and giving yourself
time. Doing something difficult is not the same as mindlessly filling a
form. It is a process, and it's important to build enough time for "doing
the heavy lifting" over time, as opposed to waiting till the last minute.

Even more powerful is the last point, the one about priorities. This
statement beautifully describes that prioritizing is not just paying lip
service to the idea of having priorities. There's a sacrifice involved (not
dealing with other urgent projects, hearing the nagging voice of the
internal critic reminding you that other things are important too). But one
cannot have 57 priorities, any more than one can have 750 close friends.
Making priorities can mean "pushing away other urgent projects". Sometimes,
that's the only way you can get the most important things done.

I want to be able to say that it all worked out beautifully for Craig. I am
sorry to say it didn't (he just sent me an email informing me about the
results). It is a fact of life that we sometimes do the best we can,
sacrifice other priorities=E2=80=A6 and don't always pan out. At such times=
, we can
feel very discouraged, asking ourselves what the point was.

The point is that there was a risk for Craig in making this task a priority=
.

In a Hollywood movie, when you take a risk, you get rewarded by winning. In
real life, you don't always get rewarded. And this is precisely what makes
it difficult to take risks in real life: they're real risks, not Hollywood
risks. When you make something a priority, you're taking a risk. You may be
making a mistake; you may be calling the wrong shot; all of your efforts
may not be enough=E2=80=A6

And the point is, it is still worth it to take some risks. If we only do
what we're sure to succeed at, the one thing we can be sure of is that
we'll have a much more limited life.
