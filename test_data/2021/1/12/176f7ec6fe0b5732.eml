What would be supportive to make this a smooth process is to check-in
tomorrow with a call. to many details to cover in an e-mail. just takes
more of my time to answer all that you are asking here. we can have a call
tomorrow?
I also sent some messages on whatsapp did you see then?
yes friday sounds better specially because besides a walk through there is
more about packing that I need to communicate. as I am packing questions
come up and I get more clear. Weena should come once we had shipped your
belongings. what is she needing besides keeping the safe box and mental box
for documents?
I am ok with wearing a mask if she is coming into my house. sure thing.
