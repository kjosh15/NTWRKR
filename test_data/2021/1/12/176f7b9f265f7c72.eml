Super useful to get the walkthrough, thanks! I'm keen to look at the
ancillary materials, so if you get a chance it'd be great to get permission=
.

As noted on the call, my calendly is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, but
feel free to ask about anything off that timeline and I'll see what I can
do.

Finally, who is doing the tech episode?? I'll admit to being super keen!

Excited to dig in - let me know what else I can do to help.

All best,
Josh
