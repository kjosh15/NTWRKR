Much obliged for reviewing the deck. Updated version attached, plus there's
a 2m video here <https://indigometrics.com/investors/overview.html>.

Beyond that let me know if you'd like to just catch up - I've kept some
retainer work to senior executive organizations like World 50 and the G100
as we got spun up this last year and it's fascinating to see how big orgs
are looking at M&A and tech adoption in light of the pandemic. We've been
in Iceland since June and the view of the EU/US just compounds that.

All best wishes,
Josh

             <br>
             <br>It's been almost a decade since we last met for breakfast =
at Balthazar in NYC. The world's a really different place now, but the advi=
ce you gave me then stuck: I was jumping around all kinds of projects and y=
ou told me to dig deeper to find the problem I really wanted to solve.=20
             <br>
             <br>It took a while - two more books, two more documentary tv =
series, and a lot of consulting work - &nbsp;but I'm there. I've built a Sa=
aS platform with a unique expert system for measuring and algorithmically m=
anaging corporate culture (behaviors, engagement, and alignment). We're tac=
kling D&amp;I head-on and have 18 customers, including two large multinatio=
nals with four more in the pipeline.
             <br>
             <br>Now we need resources to scale fast. It seems like there's=
 a shitstorm of investment out there, but when I look at all the easy money=
 I keep coming back to our conversations over breakfast and how I walked aw=
ay every time feeling inspired to do better in the world.=20
             <br>
             <br>That's the kind of partner we're looking for now. I've att=
ached our deck; can we set up a call to see if there's a fit?
