Sounds like everyone wants to send $$. Should we push back, or do you think
you can manage selection? I'm feeling a little overwhelmed in this front,
but am happy to keep coordinating with my family. Let me know what you
think!

xoxo,
Josh

Absolutely want to get the boys birthday gifts.  I already feel like they
are gifts to us.  Perhaps we can repeat the Christmas path and send you
money to buy them gifts in
Joel and my names.

Love,

Grandma, Karen, Mom
