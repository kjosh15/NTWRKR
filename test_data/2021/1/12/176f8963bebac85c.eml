Josh -

Thanks for following up and sharing additional materials for IngidoMatrics.
It's been interesting to get a better understanding of what you're
building. I  did have the chance to share your materials internally with my
team and, unfortunately, we don't feel it's the right fit for FC.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your vision with us and we wish
you all the best as you continue to grow and build IndigoMetrics.

Best,

e
