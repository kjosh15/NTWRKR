Damn, that's cool! And +1 on seeing how fabrication problems were solved.
It's kind of crazy how much of the physical materials of our daily life we

And yes, super curious to see about the crowbox testing. Looks like it'll
be a while as the school where the materials are is locked down due to
COVID again. :/
