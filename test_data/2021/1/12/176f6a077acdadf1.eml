Looks like things are continuing to be interesting!

Much obliged for reviewing the deck. Updated version attached, plus there's
a 2m video here <https://indigometrics.com/investors/overview.html>.

Beyond that let me know if you'd like to just catch up - I've kept some
retainer work to senior executive organizations like World 50 and the G100
as we got spun up this last year and it's fascinating to see how big orgs
are looking at M&A and tech adoption in light of the pandemic. We've been
in Iceland since June and the view of the EU/US just compounds that.

All best wishes,
Josh
