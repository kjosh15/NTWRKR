Gustavo,

Finally got ahold both of our potential shippers and they both said they
need to know the total number of boxes to set the order. How far along are
you in the process?

We also need to set a time to do a video walkthrough and possibly time to
pack anything that is left over. Tomorrow is feeling really tight for all
this, esp. as I'll be in calls all the rest of today. Do you want to see if
your friends can come on Friday instead, and when would be good for a video
walkthrough?

Finally, let me know if you found the key to the safe and when would be
good for Weena to do a walkthrough.

I hope you and Etukai are doing well; the news continues to look crazy from
the outside. I keep coming back to some advice a friend of mine who lived
through the London bombings told me this summer: "things usually go worse
than you'd hoped and better than you feared." Fingers crossed!

All best,
Josh
