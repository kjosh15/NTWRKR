Here's <https://apple.news/AObd_IUVfQrunjyGfl05P-Q> an article that I
thought did a good job of shedding light on the question of why so many
health care workers are choosing to defer vaccination. You asked in your
last email why that was, which got me wondering myself!

FWIW as additional color, I listened to a talk by Juan Enriquez - I think I
mentioned him before as doing a regular series for World 50 members on
Covid-19 throughout this last year. He's been spot on across the board so
far (unfortunately), but did have this to say about vaccinations:

"Out of 1 million vaccinations 11 people had a negative reaction, and of
those most had significant pre-existing allergy conditions. While we cannot
know the future, there is very good evidence that they are completely safe.
Get vaccinated if, and as soon as, you can."

Love,
Josh
