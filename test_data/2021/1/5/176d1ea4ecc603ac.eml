Professor Skarph=C3=A9=C3=B0insson,

Happy new year! I hope this finds you and yours happy and healthy.

I'm writing in regards to the recent article in RUV
<https://www.ruv.is/frett/3000-hrafnar-veiddir-a-hverju-ari-a-islandi> in
which you were interviewed. I have some amateur experience
<https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_a_thought_experiment_on_the_intelli=
gence_of_crows?language=3Den>
with corvids and have recently relocated to Iceland. I am keen to see how I
can help with your efforts to change Icelanders opinions on hunting this
bird.

Is there any chance you'd be available to speak briefly in the next couple
weeks?

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
