Happy new year! I hope you and yours entered 2021 happy and healthy.

I'm writing as I was lucky to close out last year by completing your NACD
Directorship Professionalism course. It was an excellent piece of work;
very comprehensive and also very approachable.

I'm writing as I'm curious about the exam that is its next step. I
understand this is only available to members and wanted to know if there
was the opportunity, as someone who has worked with NACD in the past, to
participate. I noted several areas of the Professionalism course which
could possibly be improved from a technical perspective, and was also
curious if you'd done an IT security examination of the platform. Let me
know if this strikes your interest!

All best wishes to you and the NACD team,
Josh Klein
