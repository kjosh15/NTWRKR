Gustavo, Hulda,

I'm connecting you both as the Spectrum (Time Warner) account is in Hulda's
name, and they need the account holder and the new recipient to make a
joint call to move the account. Can you please set a time to together call
855-757-7328 to get it moved over?

Separately, Con Ed closed our account as of 1/1/21. Gustavo, you need to
contact them separately to reopen it in your name starting 1/1/21.

Much obliged!!
Josh
