Happy new year! We wanted to start off 2021 by hearing from folks who have
finished their build or are in-process: what worked well, what was
difficult, and how's it going now?

Please hit me on- or off-list with anything you're comfortable sharing.
We're looking to use this feedback to help direct our efforts this year, so
any and all feedback is appreciated.

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
