Thanks, Chris!

Happy to go with the negotiation clause you suggested. As for the fee
split, I've never seen this in a shopping agreement and so figured it was
easier to leave it out to negotiate later than to take the time to ask a
bunch of folks for suggestions (CAA in particular would have strong
opinions, I'm sure.) Is that ok for expediency's sake?
