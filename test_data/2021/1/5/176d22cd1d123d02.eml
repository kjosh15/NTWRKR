Happy new year!! Here's hoping you and yours entered 2021 safe and happy.

Let me know if you have time to catch up with a brief call; 2021 is looking
like a watershed year for technological advances and I'm keen to compare
notes and see how/if we can help each other. WTF there is some cool stuff
out there!!

All best,
Josh
