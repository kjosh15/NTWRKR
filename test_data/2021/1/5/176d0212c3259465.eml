Hi Josh! I gave it a thought and looked at my schedule. This month is full
on, however I can support you in trying to get two friends to help with
moving, you will need to rent a truck. This will take some planning. The
idea that I have is that if my two friends are available, you can pay them
for 3-4 hours of their time. Where is the drop-off location? Where would I
pick up the truck from? I am thinking depeding the amount of hours this
will take, you can offer my two friends $150 each for their support. they
would be doing most of the lifting. so you would be saving lots of money
here. I would drive the truck and make sure all your belongings get
delivered to the shipping facility.  this is just an idea. I suggest we
just jump on a quick call tomorrow? there is a chance I am delayed by a
couple of days from making the intended deadline. Etukai was supposed to
start school tomorrow and that wont happen now at least until thursday or
friday and I don't have cared for him at the moment. also some updates
about eviction exempts. they extended eviction protection until May 2021.
yey! lets schedule a short call for tomorrow?
