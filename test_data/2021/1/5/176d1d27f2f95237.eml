Welcome to 2021!! Really excited to see what we can do with this one,
especially after all the changes that 2020 prompted. There's huge
opportunity out there...!

My strategy this year has become unusually simple: 1) Get a short term
contract. 2) Raise funds for Indigo and then scale it up.

There's a number of "interesting" things going on the side (a TV show using
GPT-3, the CGM project, advisory board and board seat roles, etc.) but I'm
trying to keep a sharp focus on the above. As we come out of the pandemic
the potential for both of these efforts only increases - along with the
potential for a burst bubble - so we're going to move as fast as possible
to secure our position.

As we start this new year *I'd ask for a short call to reconnect* and see
how/if we can help each other. This past year has - despite all the obvious
setbacks and tragedies - given us an incredible gift in progress across
both technologies and policies. I'm very keen to see what we can do with it!

All best,
Josh
