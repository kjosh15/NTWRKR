Hey Gustavo!

A couple additional items before our call later:

1) *Utilities*. We're closing out our accounts so the balance this month
will be higher (normally we pay a yearly average - this is slightly higher
due to the smoothing function):


Spectrum Time Warner Cable $159.68
National Grid $14.43
ConEd 124.85
---
* SubTotal: $298.96*
+
Rent $1,125
---
* Total: $1,423.96*

I saw you already paid $701.00; can you please transfer the remainder
($722.96) when you get a chance?


2) *January*. In terms of process, here's what I understood we're looking
at:

a. you were going to get everything packed up this week (which it sounds
like may be delayed by a couple days).
b. Once you're done, we can review anything you'd like to buy.
c. Then we'll do a video walkthrough of anything else that is left.
d. After that, we'd like to have our friends Weena and Lee do a walkthrough
to see if they'd like to have anything.
e. Then we can move everything to the shipping company. (Possibly by you
and your friends?)
f. Once that's done we can work on selling anything else when you leave.
(Maybe one of your friends would like to help with this?)


Again, this is just for purposes of getting a timeline put in place. Let me
know if the above structure sounds right and we can talk about reserving
dates!

Finally, sorry to hear about Etukai's schooling. Best of luck to you both
as you go forward!!

All best wishes,
Josh
