Some feedback from a VC I spoke to recently. I'm in the process of
reworking the deck anyway so will include this where appropriate.

That said, there's a lot here we cannot do (ARR, logos, etc.) and some we
can't necessarily do better (compelling quotes, etc.) Big take-away for me
is that we could use some compelling numbers, even if in isolation. (Well,
that and to remove the valuation expectation!)

Josh,

Some feedback on the deck:

   - You generally don't want to disclose a valuation expectation - this is
   all part of the negotiation dance
   - You should highlight ARR numbers. ARR is the key metric for any SaaS
   company.  The only mention of revenue is in a single chart - and that is
   all forward looking.  You need to provide a snapshot of where the compan=
y
   is at.  This is essential for the valuation negotiation.
   - Throw in customer logos.  Be proud of your customers =F0=9F=99=82
   - There's really not much in here about value generated for your early
   adopters - If you have metrics on benefits achieve, add them.  If you do=
n't
   have metrics, get compelling quotes.
   - The presentation is light on product - insert some screenshots to make
   it real.  I felt that I was looking at mockups.

Before contacting SFDC you may want to brush up on their acquisition of
Rypple

igns-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-rypple-first-step-toward-human-capital=
-management-for-the-social-enterprise/>.
Question is how well this worked for them and how differentiated you are.

Let me know if I should send the deck as-is or wait for an update.

Best wishes,

Patrick

LOVE this! Thanks for sharing. As you noted, yes very funny to see what was
right and what... wasn't.

Please find our investor deck attached. Happy to get your feedback on it if
you're curious!

All best,
Josh

Strange that you couldn't log in.  Attached is a PDF export.  Keep in mind
as you read this and laugh that this is 6+ months old since the last real
edits.

Can you send me a brief investor deck about Indigo Metrics I can forward to
Salesforce?

Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

I followed the link you sent to Mindmeister but it wouldn't connect me; it
didn't show your map when I logged in. Can you resend/send as PDF?

Separately, I'd love that connection to Salesforce's venture arm if you're
still willing. Here's a short intro:

Indigometrics is an early-stage human analytics SaaS platform using
peer-to-peer data and expert system analytics to provide culture and
behavior management and measurement over time. We're seeing greatly
accelerated growth coming out of the pandemic and are looking for strategic
investment partners who can benefit from and help us expand on same.

Very much obliged!

All best,
Josh
