Subject: Rough edit of today's video

Hey, something for you to have a look at with your morning haggis-n-eggs!
Or blood sausage benedict.

Here's a rough cut of the video for you to have a look at before I do the
final edit and layoff for the YouTube channel.

So, I feel this video gets all of the information over the net. I say that
because the quality bar is lower than what I'd really like but I'm simply
not set up to capture demonstration video at my workbench right now. But I
do feel we're demonstrating this fairly simple task competently and I think
any user viewing the video can repeat the steps using the video for
reference, so I think we will succeed in that way.

Here's the problems I'm aware of:

My voice sounds muffled. The camera (and its mic) are facing away from me.
I can be heard but it's not crystal clear. I'll buy an external mic that
works with GoPro and I'll have that from now on. Won't help this video.
I'll see if FinalCutProX can boost the voice.

There's a background hum. I have no idea what it is. The room was quiet to
my ear but it might be some sound that's conducting through the floor and
into my desk (it's a built-in). I will see if FinalCutProX can reduce noise
in the audio track. I think that feature exists.

The FOV is very tight so that I could get closer in on the detailed parts.
I don't think it's too big of a problem.

The light source casts the shadow of my right hand onto the subject matter
sometimes. I tried to notice this when it happened and correct. Looks
amateurish, but it happened.

My chair bumps my desk every once in a while. I don't hear or notice it,
and my desk is topped with a 2 inch slab of granite but it makes a pretty
loud, weird BONK each time it happens. I think this is an "oh well" kind of
issue.

Transitions are needed in a couple of places, and those are easy to add.
There are also some clips where I want the video from one take but the
audio from another take. So I have to separate out and recompose these. Not
a big issue.

There are one or two places where clips from two different takes don't fall
together quite right with respective to the narration, but I don't think
it's too awful. Just takes off some polish.

I left some space for me to freeze the Crowbox logo on the screen and show
the URL for the Crowbox site. The URL for the Google Group is a nightmare
so I'll let people find the group through the main Crowbox site.

Let me know how you feel about the content and presentation, these issues,
and let me know if there's anything else you want me to do before I clean
everything up for the final edit.
