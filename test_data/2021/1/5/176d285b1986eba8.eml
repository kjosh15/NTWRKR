Josh,

The person is a close friend of one of the founders, the agreement is 
verbal, but we'd be happy to draft something for you.

As part of the agreement, we could also have non-circumvention clause 
with regard to the investors you approach on our behalf if you wish.

I just updated the summary and deck in the shared folder, please feel 
free to make PDFs and send, whichever you think is more appropriate.

Please add recipients name in the text box on the title slide of deck or 
the footer of the summary and upload copies of sent PDFs into the folder 
at some point so we can keep track.

With regards to the deck, please feel free to rearrange the slides, we 
usually send the first 12 as intro and then use slides in appendix for 
back when presenting.

Any comments or questions much appreciated, you've already met Gisli, 
he's now busy with product, at some stage it'll be relevant to introduce 
you to other members of the team, starting with Jon Egilsson who is 
involved in the fundraising with me.

FYI The documents we share with (mainland) European investors say €3M 
target for fundraise, for others we say $3M, it's not a huge difference.

If I am not responding to email, you can reach me at 8201533 by text or 
voice between 8am and 11pm UTC.

All the best,

Sveinn

          As discussed, Monerium is raising $3M from investors.<br>
          <br>
          We are talking to private investors and early stage funds that

          <br>
