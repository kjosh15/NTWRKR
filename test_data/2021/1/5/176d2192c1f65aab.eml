Thanks, Sveinn! Do you mind if I share your deck with some of my contacts?
I realized I hadn't asked specifically and noted you'd shared it via a
Google Share.

Your commission fund agreement sounds fine; is it possible to see the doc
itself?

Much thanks,
Josh

Josh,<br>

As discussed, Monerium is raising $3M from investors.<br>
<br>
We are talking to private investors and early stage funds that can help <br=

that can help attract additional capital and talent, add reputational <br>

Funds will be used to strengthen product development, business <br>
development and operations, generate first revenues.<br>
<br>
We already have confirmed interest for $2M of $3M and may increase the <br>
size of the round.<br>
<br>
We have an arrangement with one person for 2% commission funds raised <br>
payable in shares.<br>
<br>
Would that work for you?<br>
