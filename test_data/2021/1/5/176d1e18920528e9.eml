Happy New Year!! The boy's bdays are coming up (Feb 23 for Haakon and March
8 for Othinn) and we're curious if you were planning on getting them gifts.
Absolutely no obligation to do so, but we wanted to get ahead of it if you
were going to and needed logistical support now that we're in Iceland. Let
us know!

xoxo,
Josh & Hulda
