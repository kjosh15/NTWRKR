Chris,

That makes sense. I'll admit I'm operating a little blind here as I haven't
worked with a shopping agreement like this before.

In terms of the split, that sounds fine if we can do 70/30 vs 80/20. That
said, can you help me understand better the criteria for that, when it
happens, and how it's managed? Similarly, what else is there then "the
aggregate of the fixed compensation (e.g., producer fees and production
company fees) and contingent compensation (e.g., profit participation)"?
Also, how would you manage a greater % based on corporate financing, and
(separately) how likely do you think this is to be a significant part of
this project's financing? (I ask knowing you may have no idea, but want to
get a head start on thinking through who I'd suggest approaching if it's
critical!)

Finally, I put in some rough language around rights, but would like to get
a better handle on who owns the IP and under what conditions. I.e., if
after a set period of time you decide to abandon it can I continue to
pursue the show in this incarnation, or vice versa, or under different
conditions, etc.

Thanks for your patience with all my dumb questions!

All best,
Josh
