Hi Josh! I can connect at 4pm. Will that work? We can go over all of this.
One hung to start is that we will need to revisit some things to make sure
we aren=E2=80=99t in the same page and clarify further. One main conversati=
on we
had and follow up on was that we would continue sharing the rent bill until
the end of January. We can revisit our conversations, the holidays were a
bit hectic but I felt we did do well at satin clear. Not sure why you are
asking for full amount for january. I am receptive and open to a dialogue
to clarify all and have his be a supportive, caring and feel good
transition for all.  I look forward to chatting soon.
