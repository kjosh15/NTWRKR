Subject: Re: Rough edit of today's video

Glad you're happy with the video. Whatever state my hands were in, it's
better than three days ago when my knuckles were bleeding. No one wants to
see that!

As stated, I got the sound cleaned up a bunch. We have a lot of bullshit
happening around the house today, but around 4PM PST I'll be able to get
back into the edit and I'll fix some jagged transitions where I used clips
from different takes.

If It's alright with you, I'll just make the video go live tonight, with a
post on the Google Group after YouTube finishes processing it and it's
truly ready to view.

I reckon folks will be pretty happy. All they need is some wire and a $4
part from Amazon. Well, and a power bank.

I just tracked my package from Voltaic and it's still 2 days out. That's 11
days after I ordered. Oh well! I thought if it came today I'd shoot a
little piece for the end of the video showing me running the Crowbox from
one of Voltaic's newer banks. That's just for posterity, though- their
website openly advertises that their banks are "Always On"
