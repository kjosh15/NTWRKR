Stephanie,

Happy new year!! Wanted to follow up on my past email and to clarify on one
of my big questions.

I ended up signing a contract with the NY Times + Accenture through my LLC,
as they only contract to LLCs as a liability protection in contracting
"talent." (God help me, now I'm fucking "talent." The end times are nigh.)

The upshot of all this is that I'll have to use it as a passthrough until I
get an Icelandic LLC set up and (hopefully) get them to pay it directly.
But in the meantime I need to accept payment via my LLC and then forward
the cash along where it will be eviscerated by Icelandic taxes.

As additional cost, the payment processor will withhold employment taxes if
it's to an LLC, but will skip doing so to a C-corp.

Thereby, my questions to you are threefold:

1) What does it cost and how long does it take to convert to a C-corp, and
is this something you can help with?
2) Would doing so allow me to pass the entire payment through the LLC as a
writeoff if it then exited directly to my Icelandic company?

As ever, any ideas are appreciated. This sucks, but it's money so hey!

All best and much obliged,
Josh

 wrap up taxes for 2020. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve made less than the $=
103k maximum for foreign residency (above which you have to pay the US rega=
rdless of where you live.) Given that, we have two choices:<br><br>1) We ca=
n file taxes in Iceland on what we DID make and via the double taxation tre=
aty write off the US taxes. If we do this, can you manage that paperwork? (=
<a href=3D"http://www.greenbacktaxservices.com" target=3D"_blank">www.green=
backtaxservices.com</a> has an estimate form which lists the exact forms ne=
eded.)<br><br>2) We can claim no earnings to Iceland, file as normal in NYC=
, and then switch to fully Icelandic in 2021. This would save us taxes (as =
the rates are higher in Iceland) and may be cleaner overall, but I&#39;m no=
t sure what/if there are risks. <br><br>Can you let us know about #1, and i=
