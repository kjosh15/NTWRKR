Subject: Re: Rough edit of today's video

Just an update- FinalCutPro is the dog's bollocks, mite. The audio noise
reduction feature is awesome, and I did away with some further audio
weirdness by changing the sound from STEREO to DUAL MONO. This helped with
the rest of the noise and also with some oddness caused by sitting behind
the mic. I didn't realize until now that the GoPro had a stereo mic.
Squashing both channels to mono makes it sound a lot less weird, especially
in headphones.

Anyway, got it sounding a lot better than the rough edit I sent you. I also
cut that awful clattering cacophony that happens at the end of the video as
I fumble with the camera to find and press the OFF button.

So imagine watching the video with those audio problems fixed and let me
know what you think of the content. I'll work on smoothing out those
transitions and doing the rest of the polish tomorrow late afternoon,
assuming you sign off on the rough edit.
