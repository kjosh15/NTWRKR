Thanks, Stephanie. I'm taking this to mean we can ignore the UBT tax this
time around.

The estate payment was a payment my wife received for her work as executor
of a good friend's will. (She got two such payments, the latter of which
was last October.)

Any tips on who to talk to about C-corps vs LLCs, or any of the other stuff
I've sent your way?

Much thanks - I hope youre well despite all the craziness!!
Josh
