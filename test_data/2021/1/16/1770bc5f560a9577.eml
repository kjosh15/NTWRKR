Josh,

Thanks for reaching out again.

It is still working on this end. 

I have created .htaccess.working in the investors directory, you can rename it to .htaccess to test. The username is mttest, and the password is in the .htaccess.working file. Please be sure to delete the password from the file once you have it. Note .htaccess.working is using /home/44066/domains/indigometrics.com/html/investors/.htpasswd which is not the same path as yours but this shouldn't matter.

Let us know if there's anything else that we may assist with.

Best regards,

Feng L.
