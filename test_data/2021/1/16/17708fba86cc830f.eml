Hey Josh,

The 4th quarter estimated tax was due today. For your personal taxes I would=
n=E2=80=99t worry too much since it is just an estimate and based on my earl=
ier calculations the tax was only self employment tax.

The UBT tax is a NYC tax based on your business income and based on the info=
 you sent that is only about $26k which I don=E2=80=99t believe will have an=
y tax due with a small amount.

What do you mean but estate income/payment?

Stephanie

Please excuse any typos
