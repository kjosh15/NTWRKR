Robert,

Happy new year; I hope you and yours are entering it healthy and safe.

I'm writing for a couple reasons; firstly to get a better idea of where ABA
is headed and to see how/if I can help. Secondly as I've been working with
a number of startups in the space and thought you might like an intro to
learn more. (See the attached below for an example; the first EMI licensed
for fiat currencies.) Let me know if a conversation on either fronts would
be useful!

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
