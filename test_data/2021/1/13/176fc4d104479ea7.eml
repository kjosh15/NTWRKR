Happy 2021; I hope you and yours are entering it safe and healthy!

I'm writing for a couple reasons. Firstly, just to catch up, hear what
Seedcamp is up to, and to see how/if I can help. I've kept an eye on your
team since we last spoke and have been happy to point startups in the EU at
you as I've met them over the years.

Secondly, I'm currently in Iceland and have been asked about advising a
startup here (the first EMI licensed for fiat currencies - see attached) as
well as having a startup of my own (providing behavior analytics and D&I
mapping - see attached), both of which are looking for funding. I'd love to
get your take on either, as your portfolio shows a surprising diversity of
investments.

Let me know if you're game to catch up sometime in the next couple of weeks
to discuss neither/either/both!

All best wishes,
Josh
