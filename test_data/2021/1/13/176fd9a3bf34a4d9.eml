On my mind


NYC Stuff

I=E2=80=99m still not 100% on the shipping option we want, and don=E2=80=99t=
 feel highly confident in Gustavo getting it all done.

I want to have a walkthrough before we ship, so nothing is missed.

I=E2=80=99d also like to have our friends walk through the apt, to check his=
 work.

Work; I feel like I=E2=80=99m dropping the ball. We=E2=80=99re almost halfwa=
y through Jan, and things are just starting to pick up. What am I missing? W=
hat opps am I leaving on the table?

> review streak
> review opps list
> follow up on any missing outreach
> complete your outreach strategy tasks

Indigo investment: I thought I was dragging my heels, but I think I=E2=80=99=
m actually just doing a lot of shit at once! I have to pursue immediate empl=
oyment first to be responsible to my family. There is a current push to that=
. Next step is improving our materials and doing more outreach. That=E2=80=99=
ll come next, even if it=E2=80=99s slow.

What I can do on this front is to think through how I want that to look. To w=
hit:

How do you find the right vc=E2=80=99s to approach?
How do we generate a master list for VCs we don=E2=80=99t have immediate con=
nections to?
How do I balance time to get the deck updated and other docs written?
How can I prioritize my list of VCs I know?

And also: how can we limit spend so I don=E2=80=99t get too diluted before w=
e get funding? On this one:

Talk to chris about improving our spend list to minimize over all cost / max=
imize impact and then take $$ from steve and he in as small amounts as possi=
ble as late as possible. Also, how close is he to exceeding the 50% mark? An=
d what is he comfortable with / wanting to see?=
