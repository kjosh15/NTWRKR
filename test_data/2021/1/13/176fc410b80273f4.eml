1) I hope you're safe and healthy. 2021 isn't pulling any punches.

2) Been asked to work with a startup here in Iceland that's the first EMI
licensed for fiat (deck attached). Was curious to get your take.

3) How the hell are you? I've moved to a farm in the middle of nowhere in
Iceland and am missing talking with smart, diverse folks. I really enjoyed
our convo's back when we were having them; let me know if you have time for
a quick catchup in the weeks ahead!

All best,
Josh
