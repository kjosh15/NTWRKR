IBAN for crypto wallet sounds like a good play. I'm generally bullish on cr=
ypto, while seeing the vast majority of individual companies as poor. I dab=

Wow, that's cool. It reminds me of Ray Dalio's Principles a bit. It seems l=
ike a VC-fundable tool. I don't know a lot about the business SaaS world, b=
ut I know a lot of VCs and if you have a hit list of prospects I can see if=
 I know anyone to make an intro. I'm hoping to lead syndicates later this y=
ear to invest in people I like, like you, but my liquidity event isn't unti=
l the summer and I haven't built up the network yet. But if you're raising =
Q3 or later for this or anything else, ping me.

+Stacie to confirm Josh is on the private updates list (which we sadly have=
n't used for many months - I had a really difficult 2020 and am starting to=
 dig my way out now), and send him the latest deck.

I could do a brief call=C2=A0 (Stacie would coordinate) and would enjoy tal=
king to you again, but I'm not sure I can be really helpful at this time.

Cheers,

Patri
