Sent you an invite for next week; let me know if that works!

Curious to hear about the book, a TV Treatment and a cool new project;
sounds like you've used your time well!

The cheap, trashy TV line is "An AI chats with millions of Americans about
the big issues of the day, getting smarter about changing their opinions
along the way - and highlighting all the crazy shit we'll fall for in the
process."

+1 on QAnon, but am always keen to learn more.

TTYSoon,
Josh
