Thanks for this. Two questions:

1) It looks like a much longer lead time to profitability than previously;
IIR the earlier version had us hitting profitability within a year or two
vs. 5 as it stands now?

2) Realized before I sent out the deck to a new bunch of folks that we were
going to update the financials, drawn from this sheet. Can you export as
images for me to insert?

Thanks!!
Josh
