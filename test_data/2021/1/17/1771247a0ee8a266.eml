I ordered a frickin' 22 kW propane generator back when I installed the
1,000 gallon propane tank in July. Looks like MARCH is when the generator
will actually arrive. That industry fell way behind in the COVID shutdown,
and woke up to an unprecedented demand. That, and I can't be sure this
vendor/installation company didn't fuck us over and bump us down the list
to satisfy customers who bitch at them constantly. I don't know.

I'm glad Derek fixed his thing. His problem statement was vague, and we
have seen another person who fused both rails (counter to the instructions)
and ended up fucked. If you're jumping ahead of the instructions you can
end up here. Anyway, yes, I'm also glad he fixed his shiz without needing
replacement parts. And he knows we're responsive now, too, so hopefully if
he has some other problem he'll bark in the forum and we can get him online=
.

The foundation thing is just something that I've been thinking about for a
while. Not applying any pressure, nor am I suggesting we abandon the
current plan to get our stalled users online with their boxes. Just a
thought for later, when the project has broader appeal (perhaps after some
success). It's also just a personal hang-up. The kit price is a bit of a
bummer. The acrylic is the big problem but also the surplus of parts any
given user has to buy in order to get one or two of the parts they need
also sucks. But there's a lot more to this (as you point out) than just
saying "let's put up a foundation!", and it's critically important to
ensure that no one's personal assets are at risk just because we tried to
do something to make this project less expensive and more accessible. In
the US these days it's impossible to predict who may be sued, when, and for
whatever stupid reason.

I still plan to position myself to deploy a current-version Crowbox this
spring, running off of a Voltaic bank with this solar cell. I just hope the
crows that fly over will stop in. I guess I'll know once I start placing
peanuts for them to discover. I have never seen a crow on the ground in our
fields, which I think is weird, but maybe they can be enticed.

Hope you guys are doing well!

-Steve
