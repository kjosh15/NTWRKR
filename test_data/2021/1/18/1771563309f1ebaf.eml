You're definitely on to something - there's lots of situations like this
one out there!! The problem is in reliably recognizing that a Spotted
Lantern Flies (or one slightly mauled by a crow in transit) using machine
vision or similar. Our box is built for extensibility, so we can set it to
operate on any inbound signal, but getting Machine Vision to do this (used
to be) really hard.

Incidentally, there's another person in Seattle who recently contacted me
about using machine vision to recognize discarded syringe needles. If
they're successful I'll put you in touch - this is an ideal opportunity,
and there are plenty of invasive species crows would be happy to hunt for
I'm sure!

Many thanks,
Josh
