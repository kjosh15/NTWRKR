Sorry to hear about the generator - that's got to be a thorn in your side.
I get the impression you like to be properly prepared. :)

We're still dealing with leaving 2 weeks of food and water for four in our
apt. in NYC - it doesn't make any sense to ship, but holy shit what a PITA
to build it all up again, esp. with the rolling cycling in/out of
perishables that we'd completely automated on Amazon...

Agreed on all other points, and will continue to chew over the Foundation
issue. A problem for another day, but one worth considering. Let me know
what comes with your own deployment!

All best,
Josh
