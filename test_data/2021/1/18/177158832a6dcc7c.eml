We decided to go with what it shows now; in a year's time we'll need to
raise more capital to capture a big share of the market, be that through
M&A or Series B through a VC or Strategic. The alternative is slower growth
or catastrophic failure, in which case we simply defer or it's moot.

Still chugging on a new version of the deck before I pester you with more
questions... but it's coming! Anything I can do to help you in the meantime=
?
