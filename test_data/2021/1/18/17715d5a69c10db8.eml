Chris,

Got a weird one for you - no idea if this is even remotely in your
bailiwick but figured I'd ask...

My wife was co-executor for a friend's estate after she passed in 2019.
This left 594 shares of Royal Dutch Shell which is proving to be immensely
difficult to =E2=80=9Ccollect=E2=80=9D into the estate. They've been workin=
g on this with
the U.K. transfer agent, Equiniti, for more than a year, with no luck. Do
you know anyone who can advise on how to get these collected?

Thanks!
Josh
