Hey Josh,

Yes, UBT should be minimal this year if anything.  Your wife should receive
a tax form from the estate (probably a 1099).

I have a few calls out to old coworkers to see if they have handled
anything similar to your situation.  I'm still waiting to hear back from
them.

Stephanie
