Can we get more clarity on the problem? Chris may be able to recommend
someone who he can suggest if we're clearer on the issue.

And don't take him seriously about backdating - he's got a sharp wit, Chris
does!

Transferring shares once they are in paper form is a bitch so not really
sure I can help =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s a real niche thing =E2=80=93 do you =
know what the problem
is? They don=E2=80=99t recognise your authority as executor? I did it for o=
ne of my
mum=E2=80=99s friends once by backdating and guessing the signature=E2=80=
=A6=E2=80=A6.. worked a
treat.

Chris,

Got a weird one for you - no idea if this is even remotely in your
bailiwick but figured I'd ask...

My wife was co-executor for a friend's estate after she passed in 2019.
This left 594 shares of Royal Dutch Shell which is proving to be immensely
difficult to =E2=80=9Ccollect=E2=80=9D into the estate. They've been workin=
g on this with
the U.K. transfer agent, Equiniti, for more than a year, with no luck. Do
you know anyone who can advise on how to get these collected?

Thanks!
Josh
