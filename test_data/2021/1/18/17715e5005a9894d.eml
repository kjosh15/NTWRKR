Thanks for this; read through it again in detail and found it enormously
helpful in understanding our spending stance. I.e., we have to spend a fair
bit ongoing to support our existing customers, and could spend more to
really seize the opportunity. I'll continue to refer to this as we move
forward, but think that on the whole you have the right order and right
objectives here... now we just need funding and staffing to support it.
