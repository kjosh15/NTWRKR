Dear Friends and Authors:



If you have been following publishing news, you may have seen some recent
headlines about changes at my former agency, Foundry Media.The two owners,
Peter McGuigan and Yfat Reiss Gendell, are parting ways, which is fine, but
they have not been able to come to terms on the specifics of their parting,
and as a result they have not put proper provisions in place for
continuity. A group of ten or so former Foundry agents (myself included)
have been pushing the owners for clear guidance on who will administer
accounts going forward and how foreign rights will be handled, and we are
not satisfied with their answers, so we have been looking into options for
protecting our clients, and here is the latest update:



If I sold your book at CAA or JVNLA and we never closed any deals for you
when I was at Foundry, you don=E2=80=99t have anything to worry about, but =
if we
sold a book or multiple books for you at Foundry, please consider these
three matters:



   1. If you have domestic (ie US) contracts, even if they haven=E2=80=99t =
earned
   out yet, you should reach out to your publisher saying the following:



As a result of the recent changes at Foundry Media, I would like to request
that my payments be bifurcated from here on out, with my share of advances,
royalties and any other payments sent directly to me. I would also like to
request that my former Foundry agent, Mollie Glick, and myself receive
copies of all notices and royalty reports that are sent to Foundry. Please
cc me when you send these notes.



They will then let you know what paperwork they need from you to make this
happen. There is no downside to doing this, it just protects your money and
keeps it out of their accounts.



   1. The other, more complicated question, is the best way to handle
   foreign payments. My former colleagues and I have notified Foundry=E2=80=
=99s
   international co-agents of the problems our authors have been experienci=
ng.
   We have not yet asked them officially to bifurcate payments because they
   are harder to track, but if this situation is not resolved in the next f=
ew
   weeks, we will likely push them to do so.



   1. These two steps should protect your payments going forward. However,
   if you have domestic or foreign money that may have landed in the Foundr=
y
   accounts since the beginning of December, which you have still not
   received, please drop me a line asap to let me know. Please also drop me=
 a
   line if you have let me know that you either didn=E2=80=99t receive a pa=
yment or
   received a check that bounced and it has NOT yet been remedied by Foundr=
y,
   as I am compiling a list of these complaints to share both with our lawy=
er
   and with the Writers Guild.



If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call this week at
917.587.1659. Please don=E2=80=99t be offended if it takes me a moment to r=
espond,
as I am juggling a full client list at CAA, plus two children, plus COVID=
=E2=80=A6
But rest assured that I am determined to look out for all of your interests
and will not rest until Peter and Yfat make good on their responsibilities.



Sorry to be the bearer of this news, but wanted to make sure you are all
aware of the situation.



Best,

Mollie
