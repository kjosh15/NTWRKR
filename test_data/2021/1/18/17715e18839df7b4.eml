I believe I left a note on the list that I'm having a hard time
qualifying/exploring my existing contacts. One answer is to simply go with
what we have; I could begin by asking Jared Lanier and seeing what he says
- if he's in we don't have to worry about the rest. ;)

Otherwise would be keen to see who you added/what you suggest on this
particular horse flogging. Looking forward to the next step!

All best,
Josh
