Post   : Elrond and the New Crypto Spaces=0AURL    : http://marginalrevolut=
ion.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/elrond-and-the-new-crypto-spaces.html=0A=
Posted : January 18, 2021 at 7:29 am=0AAuthor : Alex Tabarrok=0A=0AI'm an a=
dvisor to a number of firms, including several in the crypto space such as =
Elrond ( https://elrond.com/ )  (eGLD ( https://www.coinbase.com/price/elro=
nd-egld )  coin). When I signed on as an advisor more than two years ago, E=
lrond was almost completely unknown, which wasn't surprising as they were b=
ased in Romania. I thought the Romanian base was a positive, however, becau=
se it meant that Elrond could hire extremely well-educated computer scienti=
sts, mathematicians and software engineers at below Silicon Valley prices. =
Moreover, the blockchain world, true to its foundations, is decentralized. =
Like a modern day Erdos, Vitalik Buterin operates out of his suitcase. The =
Silicon Valley of the blockchain is the internet. Why the blockchain world =
has evolved differently than Silicon Valley is an interesting question (wit=
h implications for whether SV could loses its centrality) but because it is=
 decentralized I thought location was less important than the quality of th=
e team. And the team, led by hard-charging founder Biniamin Mincu, is excel=
lent. In the last two years the Elrond team has built a completely modern b=
lockchain from the ground up using secure proof of stake and sharding to ac=
hieve a potential throughput of 16 thousand transactions per second with 6s=
 latency and very low fees. I was also impressed by the commitment Elrond h=
ad to security, including formal verification methods ( https://elrond.com/=
blog/from-rockets-to-blockchains-formal-verification-pioneered-at-nasa-appl=
ied-to-elrond-via-runtime-verification/ ) , and especially to making Elrond=
 accessible to the masses. Today Elrond/eGLD is on a tear and by market cap=
 it is one of the top 25 projects in the space with a strong upward trend.=
=0A=0AWill Elrond take over the world? I hope so! But, of course, it is unc=
lear. Aside from ranking Elrond versus other projects the space itself stil=
l doesn't have a killer app for the masses. In 2017 near the peak of the ma=
rket at that time, Vitalik Buterin tweeted ( https://twitter.com/VitalikBut=
erin/status/940744724431982594?s=3D20 ) :=0A=0A> So total cryptocoin market=
 cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we *earned* it?=0A>=0A> How many unbank=
ed people have we banked?=0A>=0A> How much censorship-resistant commerce fo=
r the common people have we enabled?=0A>=0A> How much value is stored in sm=
art contracts that actually do anything interesting?...=0A=0AThe total mark=
et cap is now close to a trillion, about twice the level when Vitalik tweet=
ed, and these are still good questions. Bitcoin has established itself as a=
 new asset class that is rapidly supplanting gold as a store of value (gold=
 is lame ( https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html ) ) but not =
as a payments platform. Ethereum, Elrond ( https://elrond.com/ )  and compe=
titors like Algorand were built for smart contracts, including things like =
stable coins which will be used for payments, but smart contracts are capab=
le of doing much more. In theory, smart contracts let people cooperate in n=
ew ways, potentially unlocking trillions in value. But we aren't there yet.=
=0A=0ADecentralized finance or DeFi is one suggestive hint of where things =
are going. Already many billions of dollars are "lent" and "saved" using De=
Fi. The lending and saving, however, is almost entirely done in one cryptoc=
urrency for another. In essence, the DeFi system is leveraging off of crypt=
o speculation and trading.=0A=0ANevertheless, something interesting is happ=
ening in DeFi. The DeX's or decentralized exchanges have shown that automat=
ed market makers can perform the services of market order books used by the=
 traditional exchanges like the NYSE at lower cost while being easily acces=
sible from anywhere in the world and operating 24/7/365. Thus, every exchan=
ge in the world is vulnerable to a DeX.=0A=0AAlso, although DeFi is a place=
 where you can easily lose all your money to mistakes, scams, and bugs (not=
 to mention changes in asset values), DeFi is rapidly developing state-of-t=
he-art security. Only the paranoid survive on the blockchain which means th=
at the systems that do survive are robust. Balaji Srinivasan recently tweet=
ed that Bitcoin is the most powerful algorithm in the world ( https://twitt=
er.com/balajis/status/1347759464695300097?s=3D20 )  and few algorithms have=
 been as battle-tested as Bitcoin. In a similar way, DeFi will be secure or=
 die and security in a blockchain world will be more secure than anywhere e=
lse.=0A=0ACombining security with accessibility is what's hard. It's tellin=
g that Coinbase is one of the most successful firms in the crypto space des=
pite performing services which are in some tension with the philosophical f=
oundations of crypto. Satoshi Nakamoto would probably be a little disappoin=
ted to learn that people were depositing their Bitcoins in a bank! I can un=
derstand the impulse, however. It's almost magical how you can move money o=
n a blockchain without input or permission from any authority. But when you=
 click the button and your money disappears it's terrifying as you pray for=
 the invisible hand of the miners to restore your money in another account.=
 Elrond's soon to be released Maier app ( https://maiar.com/ ) , a wallet t=
hat interacts with the Elrond blockchain using only a phone number, will be=
 an interesting test of whether a blockchain platform can duplicate the eas=
e of use of something like PayPal or Zelle.=0A=0AThe other interesting deve=
lopment in the space are zero knowledge proofs. Zero knowledge proofs let s=
omeone prove that they know a piece of information or the results of a comp=
utation without revealing the information. ZK proofs started in the academi=
c literature ( http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20P=
apers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems=
.pdf )  but research in their uses and applications has exploded as compute=
r scientists like Silvio Micali start blockchains ( https://www.algorand.co=
m/ )  and blockchains like ZCash ( https://z.cash/ )  hire computer scienti=
sts who advance the scientific literature ( https://people.eecs.berkeley.ed=
u/~alexch/#publications )  (to give just one example). Truly anonymous digi=
tal cash is one application but more generally zero knowledge proofs let pe=
ople buy and sell information in a way which has always been difficult and =
seemed impossible (how can you sell a piece of information without showing =
it to someone first but then having seen the information why would they buy=
 it?).=0A=0ABottom line is that crypto is still waiting for the killer app =
which will make it 21st century infrastructure but there has been tremendou=
s scientific progress in blockchains since the ur-date, 1/3/2009. Modern pl=
atforms like Elrond ( https://elrond.com/ )  are faster, more robust, and m=
ore powerful than past platforms and the potential is there for transformat=
ive growth.=0A=0AAdd a comment to this post: http://marginalrevolution.com/=

etica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;'>I'm an advisor=
 to a number of firms, including several in the crypto space such as <a sty=
le=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://elrond.com/">Elrond</a> (<a style=3D=
"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://www.coinbase.com/price/elrond-egld">eGLD<=
/a> coin). When I signed on as an advisor more than two years ago, Elrond w=
as almost completely unknown, which wasn't surprising as they were based in=
 Romania. I thought the Romanian base was a positive, however, because it m=
eant that Elrond could hire extremely well-educated computer scientists, ma=
thematicians and software engineers at below Silicon Valley prices. Moreove=
r, the blockchain world, true to its foundations, is decentralized. Like a =
modern day Erdos, Vitalik Buterin operates out of his suitcase. The Silicon=
 Valley of the blockchain is the internet. Why the blockchain world has evo=
lved differently than Silicon Valley is an interesting question (with impli=
cations for whether SV could loses its centrality) but because it is decent=
ralized I thought location was less important than the quality of the team.=
 And the team, led by hard-charging founder Biniamin Mincu, is excellent. I=
n the last two years the Elrond team has built a completely modern blockcha=
in from the ground up using secure proof of stake and sharding to achieve a=
 potential throughput of 16 thousand transactions per second with 6s latenc=
y and very low fees. I was also impressed by the commitment Elrond had to s=
ecurity, including <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://elrond.com/=
blog/from-rockets-to-blockchains-formal-verification-pioneered-at-nasa-appl=
ied-to-elrond-via-runtime-verification/">formal verification methods</a>, a=
nd especially to making Elrond accessible to the masses. Today Elrond/eGLD =
is on a tear and by market cap it is one of the top 25 projects in the spac=
e with a strong upward trend.</p>=0A<p style=3D'direction: ltr; font-size: =

 I hope so! But, of course, it is unclear. Aside from ranking Elrond versus=
 other projects the space itself still doesn't have a killer app for the ma=

s now close to a trillion, about twice the level when Vitalik tweeted, and =
these are still good questions. Bitcoin has established itself as a new ass=
et class that is rapidly supplanting gold as a store of value (<a style=3D"=
color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.htm=
l">gold is lame</a>) but not as a payments platform. Ethereum, <a style=3D"=
color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://elrond.com/">Elrond</a> and competitors li=
ke Algorand were built for smart contracts, including things like stable co=
ins which will be used for payments, but smart contracts are capable of doi=
ng much more. In theory, smart contracts let people cooperate in new ways, =
potentially unlocking trillions in value. But we aren't there yet.</p>=0A<p=

 font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1=
em;'>Decentralized finance or DeFi is one suggestive hint of where things a=
re going. Already many billions of dollars are "lent" and "saved" using DeF=
i. The lending and saving, however, is almost entirely done in one cryptocu=
rrency for another. In essence, the DeFi system is leveraging off of crypto=
 speculation and trading.</p>=0A<p style=3D'direction: ltr; font-size: 14px=
; line-height: 1.4em; color: #444; font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica=
, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;'>Nevertheless, something interesting =
is happening in DeFi. The DeX's or decentralized exchanges have shown that =
automated market makers can perform the services of market order books used=
 by the traditional exchanges like the NYSE at lower cost while being easil=
y accessible from anywhere in the world and operating 24/7/365. <em>Thus, e=
very exchange in the world is vulnerable to a DeX</em>.</p>=0A<p style=3D'd=
irection: ltr; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.4em; color: #444; font-famil=
y: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;'>Also, =
although DeFi is a place where you can easily lose all your money to mistak=
es, scams, and bugs (not to mention changes in asset values), DeFi is rapid=
ly developing state-of-the-art security. Only the paranoid survive on the b=
lockchain which means that the systems that do survive are robust. Balaji S=
rinivasan recently tweeted that <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https:=
//twitter.com/balajis/status/1347759464695300097?s=3D20">Bitcoin is the mos=
t powerful algorithm in the world</a> and few algorithms have been as battl=
e-tested as Bitcoin. In a similar way, DeFi will be secure or die and secur=
ity in a blockchain world will be more secure than anywhere else.</p>=0A<p =

font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1e=
m;'>Combining security with accessibility is what's hard. It's telling that=
 Coinbase is one of the most successful firms in the crypto space despite p=
erforming services which are in some tension with the philosophical foundat=
ions of crypto. Satoshi Nakamoto would probably be a little disappointed to=
 learn that people were depositing their Bitcoins in a bank! I can understa=
nd the impulse, however. It's almost magical how you can move money on a bl=
ockchain without input or permission from any authority. But when you click=
 the button and your money disappears it's terrifying as you pray for the i=
nvisible hand of the miners to restore your money in another account. Elron=
d's soon to be released <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://maiar.=
com/">Maier app</a>, a wallet that interacts with the Elrond blockchain usi=
ng only a phone number, will be an interesting test of whether a blockchain=
 platform can duplicate the ease of use of something like PayPal or Zelle.<=

r: #444; font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margi=
n: 0 0 1em;'>The other interesting development in the space are zero knowle=
dge proofs. Zero knowledge proofs let someone prove that they know a piece =
of information or the results of a computation without revealing the inform=
ation. ZK proofs started in the <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"http:/=
/people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems=
/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">academic litera=
ture</a> but research in their uses and applications has exploded as comput=
er scientists like Silvio Micali start <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D=
"https://www.algorand.com/">blockchains</a> and blockchains like <a style=
=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://z.cash/">ZCash</a> hire computer scien=
tists who <a style=3D"color: #2585B2;" href=3D"https://people.eecs.berkeley=
.edu/~alexch/#publications">advance the scientific literature</a> (to give =
just one example). Truly anonymous digital cash is one application but more=
 generally zero knowledge proofs let people buy and sell information in a w=
ay which has always been difficult and seemed impossible (how can you sell =
a piece of information without showing it to someone first but then having =
seen the information why would they buy it?).</p>=0A<p style=3D'direction: =

hat crypto is still waiting for the killer app which will make it 21st cent=
ury infrastructure but there has been tremendous scientific progress in blo=
ckchains since the ur-date, 1/3/2009. Modern platforms like <a style=3D"col=
