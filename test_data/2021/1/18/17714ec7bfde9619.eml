I just re-entered all my credentials, which are slightly different as I'm
using gmail as a front end and thereby sending as an alias. That said, SMTP
settings should be the same:

SMTP Server: ntgy-d7br.accessdomain.com port 465
sending secured using SSL

Does this echo what you've got set up?
