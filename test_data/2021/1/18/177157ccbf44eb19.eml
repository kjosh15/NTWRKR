Thanks, Patri! I'll let you know when / if we have a hit list of prospects
I don't have direct connects for already. We're aiming for a series B this
time next year so will definitely keep in touch on that front also.

In terms of a call in the meantime, always happy to catch up if you want to
chat - otherwise I'll ping you when I have a direct ask. Please feel free
to return the favor; I'm always excited by the work you're doing and happy
to help!

All best,
Josh
