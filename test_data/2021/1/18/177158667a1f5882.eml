Interesting commentary on the need for a killer app...

BTW, heard back from Patri. He's bullish on what you've built, but is
waiting for a liquidity event later this year before he can invest more.
Still, a good endorsement I think!

best,
Josh

I'm an advisor to a number of firms, including several in the crypto space
such as Elrond <https://elrond.com/> (eGLD
<https://www.coinbase.com/price/elrond-egld> coin). When I signed on as an
advisor more than two years ago, Elrond was almost completely unknown,
which wasn't surprising as they were based in Romania. I thought the
Romanian base was a positive, however, because it meant that Elrond could
hire extremely well-educated computer scientists, mathematicians and
software engineers at below Silicon Valley prices. Moreover, the blockchain
world, true to its foundations, is decentralized. Like a modern day Erdos,
Vitalik Buterin operates out of his suitcase. The Silicon Valley of the
blockchain is the internet. Why the blockchain world has evolved
differently than Silicon Valley is an interesting question (with
implications for whether SV could loses its centrality) but because it is
decentralized I thought location was less important than the quality of the
team. And the team, led by hard-charging founder Biniamin Mincu, is
excellent. In the last two years the Elrond team has built a completely
modern blockchain from the ground up using secure proof of stake and
sharding to achieve a potential throughput of 16 thousand transactions per
second with 6s latency and very low fees. I was also impressed by the
commitment Elrond had to security, including formal verification methods
<https://elrond.com/blog/from-rockets-to-blockchains-formal-verification-pi=
oneered-at-nasa-applied-to-elrond-via-runtime-verification/>,
and especially to making Elrond accessible to the masses. Today Elrond/eGLD
is on a tear and by market cap it is one of the top 25 projects in the
space with a strong upward trend.

Will Elrond take over the world? I hope so! But, of course, it is unclear.
Aside from ranking Elrond versus other projects the space itself still
doesn't have a killer app for the masses. In 2017 near the peak of the
market at that time, Vitalik Buterin tweeted
<https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/940744724431982594?s=3D20>:

So total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we *earned*
it?

How many unbanked people have we banked?

How much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we
enabled?

How much value is stored in smart contracts that actually do anything
interesting?...

The total market cap is now close to a trillion, about twice the level when
Vitalik tweeted, and these are still good questions. Bitcoin has
established itself as a new asset class that is rapidly supplanting gold as
a store of value (gold is lame
<https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html>) but not as a
payments platform. Ethereum, Elrond <https://elrond.com/> and competitors
like Algorand were built for smart contracts, including things like stable
coins which will be used for payments, but smart contracts are capable of
doing much more. In theory, smart contracts let people cooperate in new
ways, potentially unlocking trillions in value. But we aren't there yet.

Decentralized finance or DeFi is one suggestive hint of where things are
going. Already many billions of dollars are "lent" and "saved" using DeFi.
The lending and saving, however, is almost entirely done in one
cryptocurrency for another. In essence, the DeFi system is leveraging off
of crypto speculation and trading.

Nevertheless, something interesting is happening in DeFi. The DeX's or
decentralized exchanges have shown that automated market makers can perform
the services of market order books used by the traditional exchanges like
the NYSE at lower cost while being easily accessible from anywhere in the
world and operating 24/7/365. *Thus, every exchange in the world is
vulnerable to a DeX*.

Also, although DeFi is a place where you can easily lose all your money to
mistakes, scams, and bugs (not to mention changes in asset values), DeFi is
rapidly developing state-of-the-art security. Only the paranoid survive on
the blockchain which means that the systems that do survive are robust.
Balaji Srinivasan recently tweeted that Bitcoin is the most powerful
algorithm in the world
<https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347759464695300097?s=3D20> and few
algorithms have been as battle-tested as Bitcoin. In a similar way, DeFi
will be secure or die and security in a blockchain world will be more
secure than anywhere else.

Combining security with accessibility is what's hard. It's telling that
Coinbase is one of the most successful firms in the crypto space despite
performing services which are in some tension with the philosophical
foundations of crypto. Satoshi Nakamoto would probably be a little
disappointed to learn that people were depositing their Bitcoins in a bank!
I can understand the impulse, however. It's almost magical how you can move
money on a blockchain without input or permission from any authority. But
when you click the button and your money disappears it's terrifying as you
pray for the invisible hand of the miners to restore your money in another
account. Elrond's soon to be released Maier app <https://maiar.com/>, a
wallet that interacts with the Elrond blockchain using only a phone number,
will be an interesting test of whether a blockchain platform can duplicate
the ease of use of something like PayPal or Zelle.

The other interesting development in the space are zero knowledge proofs.
Zero knowledge proofs let someone prove that they know a piece of
information or the results of a computation without revealing the
information. ZK proofs started in the academic literature
<http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20=
Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf>
but research in their uses and applications has exploded as computer
scientists like Silvio Micali start blockchains <https://www.algorand.com/>
and blockchains like ZCash <https://z.cash/> hire computer scientists
who advance
the scientific literature
<https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/#publications> (to give just one
example). Truly anonymous digital cash is one application but more
generally zero knowledge proofs let people buy and sell information in a
way which has always been difficult and seemed impossible (how can you sell
a piece of information without showing it to someone first but then having
seen the information why would they buy it?).

Bottom line is that crypto is still waiting for the killer app which will
make it 21st century infrastructure but there has been tremendous
scientific progress in blockchains since the ur-date, 1/3/2009. Modern
platforms like Elrond <https://elrond.com/> are faster, more robust, and
more powerful than past platforms and the potential is there for
transformative growth.

">The total market cap is now close to a trillion, about twice the level wh=
en Vitalik tweeted, and these are still good questions. Bitcoin has establi=
shed itself as a new asset class that is rapidly supplanting gold as a stor=
e of value (<a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"https://vitalik.ca/general/2=
020/12/28/endnotes.html" target=3D"_blank">gold is lame</a>) but not as a p=
ayments platform. Ethereum, <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"https://elro=
nd.com/" target=3D"_blank">Elrond</a> and competitors like Algorand were bu=
ilt for smart contracts, including things like stable coins which will be u=
sed for payments, but smart contracts are capable of doing much more. In th=
eory, smart contracts let people cooperate in new ways, potentially unlocki=
ng trillions in value. But we aren&#39;t there yet.</p>

">Decentralized finance or DeFi is one suggestive hint of where things are =
going. Already many billions of dollars are &quot;lent&quot; and &quot;save=
d&quot; using DeFi. The lending and saving, however, is almost entirely don=
e in one cryptocurrency for another. In essence, the DeFi system is leverag=
ing off of crypto speculation and trading.</p>
<p style=3D"direction:ltr;font-size:14px;line-height:1.4em;color:#444;font-=
family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;margin:0 0 1em=
">Nevertheless, something interesting is happening in DeFi. The DeX&#39;s o=
r decentralized exchanges have shown that automated market makers can perfo=
rm the services of market order books used by the traditional exchanges lik=
e the NYSE at lower cost while being easily accessible from anywhere in the=
 world and operating 24/7/365. <em>Thus, every exchange in the world is vul=
nerable to a DeX</em>.</p>
<p style=3D"direction:ltr;font-size:14px;line-height:1.4em;color:#444;font-=
family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;margin:0 0 1em=
">Also, although DeFi is a place where you can easily lose all your money t=
o mistakes, scams, and bugs (not to mention changes in asset values), DeFi =
is rapidly developing state-of-the-art security. Only the paranoid survive =
on the blockchain which means that the systems that do survive are robust. =
Balaji Srinivasan recently tweeted that <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"=
https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347759464695300097?s=3D20" target=3D"_b=
lank">Bitcoin is the most powerful algorithm in the world</a> and few algor=
ithms have been as battle-tested as Bitcoin. In a similar way, DeFi will be=
 secure or die and security in a blockchain world will be more secure than =
anywhere else.</p>

family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;margin:0 0 1em=
">Combining security with accessibility is what&#39;s hard. It&#39;s tellin=
g that Coinbase is one of the most successful firms in the crypto space des=
pite performing services which are in some tension with the philosophical f=
oundations of crypto. Satoshi Nakamoto would probably be a little disappoin=
ted to learn that people were depositing their Bitcoins in a bank! I can un=
derstand the impulse, however. It&#39;s almost magical how you can move mon=
ey on a blockchain without input or permission from any authority. But when=
 you click the button and your money disappears it&#39;s terrifying as you =
pray for the invisible hand of the miners to restore your money in another =
account. Elrond&#39;s soon to be released <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=
=3D"https://maiar.com/" target=3D"_blank">Maier app</a>, a wallet that inte=
racts with the Elrond blockchain using only a phone number, will be an inte=
resting test of whether a blockchain platform can duplicate the ease of use=
 of something like PayPal or Zelle.</p>

family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;margin:0 0 1em=
">The other interesting development in the space are zero knowledge proofs.=
 Zero knowledge proofs let someone prove that they know a piece of informat=
ion or the results of a computation without revealing the information. ZK p=
roofs started in the <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"http://people.csail=
.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledg=
e_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf" target=3D"_blank">academic l=
iterature</a> but research in their uses and applications has exploded as c=
omputer scientists like Silvio Micali start <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=
=3D"https://www.algorand.com/" target=3D"_blank">blockchains</a> and blockc=
hains like <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"https://z.cash/" target=3D"_b=
lank">ZCash</a> hire computer scientists who <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" hre=
f=3D"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/#publications" target=3D"_bla=
nk">advance the scientific literature</a> (to give just one example). Truly=
 anonymous digital cash is one application but more generally zero knowledg=
e proofs let people buy and sell information in a way which has always been=
 difficult and seemed impossible (how can you sell a piece of information w=
ithout showing it to someone first but then having seen the information why=
 would they buy it?).</p>

family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;margin:0 0 1em=
">Bottom line is that crypto is still waiting for the killer app which will=
 make it 21st century infrastructure but there has been tremendous scientif=
ic progress in blockchains since the ur-date, 1/3/2009. Modern platforms li=
ke <a style=3D"color:#2585b2" href=3D"https://elrond.com/" target=3D"_blank=
">Elrond</a> are faster, more robust, and more powerful than past platforms=
 and the potential is there for transformative growth.</p>
