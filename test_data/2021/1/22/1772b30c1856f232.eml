Chris,

One should always google before one speaks. See:

https://signal.nfx.com/investor-lists/top-human-capital-series-a-investors

and

https://signal.nfx.com/investor-lists/top-human-capital-seed-investors

Lots of digging needed here, but can also look at:

https://www.cbinsights.com/
https://www.crunchbase.com/

First step is to more deeply vet the VCs I have access to via LinkedIn, and
then generate a more tightly qualified list from the above sources. Then I
can reverse sort against intros I can get via LinkedIn or elsewhere. Lots
of groundwork, but we've got a much better start to qualifying than I had
initially thought.
