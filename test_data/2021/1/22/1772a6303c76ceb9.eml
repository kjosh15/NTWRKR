Gustavo,

I can't find any clear answers on whether I can rent in your name or not;
the closest is that I can pay an additional fee to add other drivers, but
to do so I need a copy of their license.

I think it might be easier for you to rent the truck directly; that way if
you get there and it's too small it'll be easy for you to upgrade
immediately without having to back and forth reg. my CC. I can also
reimburse you directly including the cash for your helpers.

The closest Penske rental is:

P.s.t.p. Inc.
32-01 Greenpoint Ave
Long Island City, NY 11101
Phone: (718) 706-7611

I'd call and confirm the 12 Foot Truck is available (it's both 50 sq. ft.
bigger and costs half as much as the High Roof Cargo Van). Including the 50
miles to and from the drop off port it should be $156.00.

You can also call Penske HQ: 1-844-847-9577.

Let me know if that works; if so, you can call, confirm the truck is there,
and go get it on your own schedule - the Penske rental is for the whole day=
!

best,
Josh
