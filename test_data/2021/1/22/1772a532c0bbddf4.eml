Trying to confirm I can reserve in your name now! Otherwise will send you a
document you need to print out to drop off (needs to be dropped before 3pm
today) along with the dropoff address.

How long do you need the truck for? I can reserve it from 10 or 10:30 to as
late as 4pm (which gives you an hour to drive back from the latest possible
drop off time.)

More shortly,
Josh
