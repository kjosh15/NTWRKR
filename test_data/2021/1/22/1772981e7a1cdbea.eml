How does this look?

xoxo,

Betsy,

Hadn't heard back so figured I'd sum up in email and ask what you
recommend.

We've been trying to juggle both virtual Ella Baker and real life local
school, but for both Haakon and Othinn - especially as the virus has been
quashed here in Iceland - real life is taking over. It's bittersweet; we
miss EB and the community terribly, but we also can't deny our kids the
benefits of real-world playdates, after-school sports, and visits to
cousins and grandparents.

Moreover, it's starting to feel unfair to the EB instructors to keep
marking our kids as attending when they inevitably come home after a full
day of real-life school and refuse to get on another zoom call.

We're going to stay in Iceland at least through this year. Nobody knows
what the future may bring, but it feels unconscionable to ask EB to
continue to support us as we kind-of-but-mostly-don't attend. What's the
best way to free up the resources we'd otherwise be taking?

Finally, if we've learned anything this year it's that nothing is certain.
If we're back in NYC in the future it will in large part be due to Ella
Baker and the hope our kids can attend again. For now, just because we're a
few thousand miles away doesn't mean we can't continue to help support your
fundraising and outreach efforts! EB will always be a part of our family.

Sincerely,
Josh, Hulda, Othinn and Haakon
