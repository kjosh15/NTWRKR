 If we're back in NYC in the future it will in large part be due to Ella Bak=
er and the hope our kids can attend again. For now, just because we're a few=
 thousand miles away doesn't mean we can't continue to help support your fun=
draising and outreach efforts! EB will always be a part of our family.=20
