Hello! I'm following up to let everyone know we've released the video that 
shows how to modify a Crowbox to run from a USB power bank instead of an AC 
adapter.

If you plan to change your Crowbox to run from a USB power bank, please 
remember two important things. These are non-negotiable!

   1. Power bank *must* be rated to deliver at least 2 amps (2A) - This may 
   also be listed as 2000 milliamps (mA).
   2. Power bank *must* have an "Always On" feature! Most power banks do 
   NOT have this feature, so please make sure yours does.

You can view this video on the Official CrowBox YouTube channel. Here's a 
direct link to the Power Bank video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq9xL0tjDSg

Feedback is encouraged. Thanks!

-Steve
