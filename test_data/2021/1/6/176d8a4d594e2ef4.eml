&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got sent this by two different sources who said that thi=
s sounded both bombastic and realistic. I&#39;ve seen enough scenario plann=
ing to know that there&#39;s a lot this fellow doesn&#39;t know, but damn i=
f I know how much. Curious what your take is!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt; Hope you and yours are doing well; we&#39;re settling into Icela=
nd for the duration. Always happy to have guests. :)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br=
