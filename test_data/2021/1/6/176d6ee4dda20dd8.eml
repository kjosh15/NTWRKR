Ok, let's talk for sure. I can't do 4pm; is there any way you can do 9am
EST? I'll send an invite just in case - just let me know if not and we'll
find another time.

Looking forward to getting some clarity and echo your sentiment that I'm
also receptive and want to create a supportive, caring and feel good
transition for all.

All best,
Josh
