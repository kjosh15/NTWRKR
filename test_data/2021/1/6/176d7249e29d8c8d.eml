Remind me to ask you about adaptive bayesian trials. Spoke with an MD in
the UK about the CGM project and he pointed this out as a potentially much
more powerful approach. I'm all aquiver with anticipation as I've used
bayesian filtering (a little bit) and am enjoying some heady ignorance I
need to be disabused of!

Looking forward to it,
Josh

P.S. He also pointed out that Medable is an off-the-shelf cloud platform
that could do all our software management for us... Good lord it's a great
time to be a hacker!
