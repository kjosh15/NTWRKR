h! I gave it a thought and looked at my schedule. This month is full on, ho=
wever I can support you in trying to get two friends to help with moving, y=
ou will need to rent a truck. This will take some planning. The idea that I=
 have is that if my two friends are available, you can pay them for 3-4 hou=
rs of their time. Where is the drop-off location? Where would I pick up the=
 truck from? I am thinking depeding the amount of hours this will take, you=
 can offer my two friends $150 each for their support. they would=C2=A0be d=
oing most of the lifting. so you would be saving lots of money here. I woul=
d drive the truck and make sure all your belongings get delivered to the sh=
ipping facility.=C2=A0 this is just an idea. I suggest we just jump on a qu=
