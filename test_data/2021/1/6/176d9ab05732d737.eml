Subject: Low Power Library

A fella in Malaysia that builds and sells his own energy-efficient Arduino
clones (among other things) has a small company called "RocketScream"

I bought a couple of his boards back when we were prototyping Crowboxes,
when we discovered that we were using more power than we liked. But I never
developed a Crowbox running on one of his boards because as I recall, we
decided to go with the Arduino UNO due to its ubiquity and wide community
support. I still think it was the right decision.

ANYWAY. He's also authored a low-power library for Arduino board which make
it easy to put an Arduino into a few different low-power modes (sleep
modes).

I'd love to use his library. It's a creative commons license. This one in
particular:

https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

Would you have any problem with me adding this library to CrOS? Where would
we be required to make the proper attributions?
