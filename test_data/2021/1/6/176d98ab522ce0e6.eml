Thanks again for the call today. Let me know if the order of events I sent
in my last email makes sense. We can do a call again Sunday to secure the
timeline if that works for you?

Separately, I looked up rentals and was curious if you thought we=E2=80=99d=
 need a
van or a truck:

osevehicle.html

The above is a pretty good representative sample of what=E2=80=99s out ther=
e. I=E2=80=99m
planning to do a review of the shipping options and will ask for the drop
off address from our top choice tomorrow (Othinn has surgery so I=E2=80=99m=
 hoping
he=E2=80=99ll spend a lot of time sleeping.)

All best wishes,
Josh
