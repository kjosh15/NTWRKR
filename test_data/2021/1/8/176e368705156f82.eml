Thank you for that.=20

I was in an meeting when it started and heard about it via WhatsApp initiall=
y from a shocked Spaniard. The world was standing still there, he said. Here=
 too.=20

Also while events were transpiring, a business associate assured me that it w=
as Antifa, that =E2=80=9Cno way=E2=80=9C could those people be Trump support=
ers. He continued to believe that into the night. I told him that he needed t=
o wake up, that even I knew of someone who had been gearing up for a violent=
 confrontation, and that he told me he was going to shoot me too.=20

So that=E2=80=99s where we are in some extremist circles. However, I don=E2=80=
=99t believe all those protesters were extremists.  None of this should surp=
rise us because it was all over the press days ahead. Even ten SecDefs tippe=
d us off on Sunday in the editorials.=20

We need to deal with not only QAnon, but when does fact-checking need to beg=
in on major networks and who will be the sanctioned Truth Sayers? Where does=
 the First Amendment end and what do we do about outright lies and adversary=
-influenced propaganda on mainstream media? Fringe communications are a prob=
lem, but should we also tackle other =E2=80=9Clegitimate=E2=80=9D outlets? S=
ome appear to be self-policing, such as Simon and Schuster in abandoning the=
 Hawley deal.=20

>> Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a game designer was=
 fascinating.  I have been interested, for some time, in how QAnon can be tr=
eated by law enforcement.  The first question to answer is whether it is app=
ropriate and lawful for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect info=
rmation about QAnon and/or members of QAnon.
>>=20
>> Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain crimi=

ssociations, or activities of any individual or any group, association, corp=
oration, business, partnership, or other organization unless such informatio=
n directly relates to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable s=

al conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D  Reasonable suspicion (also known as a crim=

 objectives, or ideologies.

ups such as the Anonymous Hacker Collective, the World Church of the Creator=

successfully sued by the Insane Clown Posse when it determined that the Jugg=
alos are a criminally predicated group.
>>=20
>> As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there ar=
e several examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes=
 of violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and id=

 leader(s) of the group such as you find with groups, such as the World Chur=

n a more sinister character since Wednesday's events. Prominent among the in=
surrectionists who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday a few blocks from where I=
 live were open followers of the QAnon alternative reality game/set of consp=
iracy theories/political movement. Notable among reports from the journalist=
s inside the Capitol was the casual attitude the insurrectionists had to bre=
aking Federal law; some even said they didn't appear to realize what they we=
re doing was illegal or outrageous even as they beat and chased the building=
's defenders.=20
Many did not seem to understand the distinction between the Capitol being "t=
he people's house" and the Capitol and everything in it actually belonging t=
o them. Video has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capitol police of=
ficer up the stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man who stood on the H=
ouse Dais and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as "the QAnon Shaman."

One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incense=
d that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, she w=
as only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to start a r=
evolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divorced f=
rom reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. Th=
ey and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and politici=
ans who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel a=
t, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the government, an=
d they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. </div><div><b=
r></div><div>Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a=
 laughing stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest o=
f our history. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind y=
ourself that <b>the United States Government lost control of the Capitol bui=
lding to an extremist group for several hours</b>, resulting in at least fiv=
e deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representativ=
es, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congress=
. Let's not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should be no e=
xcuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And yet, the di=
sinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on disproven nar=
ratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers are now try=
ing to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAnon cult memb=
ers responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures are correcti=
ng them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would n=
ot allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for the i=
nsurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforcement a=
nd frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that's making the rounds in ri=
ght-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the lates=
t emergent narrative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at=
 all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually storm=
ed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood=
.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President's video condemning the=
 insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is still=
 urging them on.

To me, it's bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any othe=
r conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, "leaders" of such m=
ilieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly encouraging others=
 to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on t=
heir own initiative. After all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tightl=
y-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely virtual c=
ommunities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculia=
r political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially "dangerous," one=
 could conceivably justify placing millions of people under surveillance. No=
t for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don't think any of us would like to liv=
e in such a society, i.e., where "thought crimes" alone were punished.</div>=

<b>Subject:</b> Re: [SHARP] a game designer's analysis of qanon</font>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a gam=
e designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interested, for some time, in h=
ow QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; The first question to answ=
er is whether it is appropriate and lawful
 for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAnon=
 and/or members of QAnon.<br>
<br>
Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain criminal=
 intelligence information concerning a group only if there is reasonable sus=
picion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activity a=
nd the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshall=
 not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the politic=
al, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individual=
 or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relates=
 to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that the s=
ubject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or activ=
ity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informati=
on exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforceme=
nt or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a bas=
is to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable c=
riminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if larg=
e numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is n=
ot sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.&nbsp; =
For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furth=
erance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertaken=
 when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimina=
l intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of groups=
 such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (=
i.e. is it a club or gang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Ins=
ane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally predic=
ated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are s=
everal examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes of=
 violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and ideol=
ogy.&nbsp; The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find wi=
th groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gan=
gs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it woul=
d be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. &nbsp; <br=
>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence in=
 support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon had t=
he criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. &nbsp;=
 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was and is the intent of those who originally o=
rganized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial in=
terest in finding out?<br>
<br>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be safe,</div>
