>> This recent discussion takes on a more sinister character since Wednesday=
's events. Prominent among the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol on W=
ednesday a few blocks from where I live were open followers of the QAnon alt=
ernative reality game/set of conspiracy theories/political movement. Notable=
 among reports from the journalists inside the Capitol was the casual attitu=
de the insurrectionists had to breaking Federal law; some even said they did=
n't appear to realize what they were doing was illegal or outrageous even as=
 they beat and chased the building's defenders. Many did not seem to underst=
and the distinction between the Capitol being "the people's house" and the C=
apitol and everything in it actually belonging to them. Video has surfaced o=
f a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capitol police officer up the stairs of the C=
apitol, and the shirtless man who stood on the House Dais and ranted is Jake=
 Angeli, known online as "the QAnon Shaman." One woman who was interviewed a=
fter being maced seemed surprised and incensed that she had been assaulted b=
y police just because, in her own words, she was only trying to climb into t=
he Capitol through a broken window to start a revolution.=20
>>=20
>> These people are utterly divorced from reality and a danger to themselves=
, the rest of us, and to democracy. They and their actions on Wednesday have=
 been enabled by grifters and politicians who have reinforced their delusion=
s. They are not a curiosity to marvel at, they are an extremist group whose g=
oal is overthrowing the government, and they have now taken dramatic, violen=
t steps toward that end.
>>=20
>> Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a laughing=
 stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest of our hi=
story. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind yourself=
 that the United States Government lost control of the Capitol building to a=
n extremist group for several hours, resulting in at least five deaths, the d=
efacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the evacuation of the Vice Pr=
esident, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, and disrupting the de=
mocratic process during a joint session of Congress. Let's not mince words; t=
his was a terrorist attack and there should be no excuse for those who enabl=
ed it.
>>=20
>> And yet, the disinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistenc=
e on disproven narratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some law=
makers are now trying to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even a=
s QAnon cult members responsible for the insurrection and identified in pict=
ures are correcting them and bragging about what they did on social media. W=
hatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would not=
 allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for the in=
surrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforcement an=
d frankly, of national security.
>>=20
>> I include a picture that's making the rounds in right-wing circles monito=
red by some colleagues of mine illustrating the latest emergent narrative fr=
om Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at all, and everyone invo=
lved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually stormed the Capitol, and it w=
as all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood. QAnon followers are al=
so convinced that the President's video condemning the insurrection from yes=

ound underwater thus&nbsp;becomes amplified, yet muddled. The internet has&n=
bsp;amplified and multiplied voices, outliers, and disinformation into a mud=

 there since 1960, and even before, with varying levels of authenticity or c=
oncern. There are real solutions to controlling voter fraud (and plugging an=
y system 'seams' where a narrative might emerge), to make sure most American=
s are confident in the fairness and security of the system they are a part o=
f. (1 citizen, 1 vote.) We need to fully secure, not just the system, but mo=
st importantly, the integrity, perception, respect, and vital citizen confid=

tical&nbsp;commentary right now sounds a lot like talking head sports commen=
tators who fill time, acting like they are in the know, when their&nbsp;subj=

s are morphing in front of our&nbsp;eyes under this 'new&nbsp;normal.' The e=
normous weight and momentum of the rushing 'water' is pushing against us har=
d. Even as we try to stand our ground, it carries us downstream to parts unk=
nown, around unseen bends in the river. It has happened before in history, o=

iscussion takes on a more sinister character since Wednesday's events. Promi=
nent among the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday a few b=
locks from where I live were open followers of the QAnon alternative reality=
 game/set of conspiracy theories/political movement. Notable among reports f=
rom the journalists inside the Capitol was the casual attitude the insurrect=
ionists had to breaking Federal law; some even said they didn't appear to re=
alize what they were doing was illegal or outrageous even as they beat and c=
hased the building's defenders.=20
Many did not seem to understand the distinction between the Capitol being "t=
he people's house" and the Capitol and everything in it actually belonging t=
o them. Video has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capitol police of=
ficer up the stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man who stood on the H=
ouse Dais and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as "the QAnon Shaman."

One woman who was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incense=
d that she had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, she w=
as only trying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to start a r=
evolution. <br></div><div><br></div><div>These people are utterly divorced f=
rom reality and a danger to themselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. Th=
ey and their actions on Wednesday have been enabled by grifters and politici=
ans who have reinforced their delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel a=
t, they are an extremist group whose goal is overthrowing the government, an=
d they have now taken dramatic, violent steps toward that end. </div><div><b=
r></div><div>Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a=
 laughing stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest o=
f our history. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind y=
ourself that <b>the United States Government lost control of the Capitol bui=
lding to an extremist group for several hours</b>, resulting in at least fiv=
e deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the=20
evacuation of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representativ=
es, and disrupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congress=
. Let's not mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should be no e=
xcuse for those who enabled it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And yet, the di=
sinformation persists. Beyond just the continued insistence on disproven nar=
ratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, some lawmakers are now try=
ing to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Antifa, even as QAnon cult memb=
ers responsible for the insurrection and identified in pictures are correcti=
ng them and bragging about what they did on social media.=20
 Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have, we would n=
ot allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsible for the i=
nsurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law enforcement a=
nd frankly, of national security.

</div><div><br></div><div>I include a picture that's making the rounds in ri=
ght-wing circles monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the lates=
t emergent narrative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at=
 all, and everyone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually storm=
ed the Capitol, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood=
.
QAnon followers are also convinced that the President's video condemning the=
 insurrection from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is still=
 urging them on.

To me, it's bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QAnon or any othe=
r conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, "leaders" of such m=
ilieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly encouraging others=
 to engage in violence or unless
 particular members are clearly planning to engage in such actions, even on t=
heir own initiative. After all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tightl=
y-structured, clandestine organizations in this context, but merely virtual c=
ommunities of people who share
 certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in certain peculia=
r political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially "dangerous," one=
 could conceivably justify placing millions of people under surveillance. No=
t for what they actually do,
 but merely for what they believe. I don't think any of us would like to liv=
e in such a society, i.e., where "thought crimes" alone were punished.</div>=

<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a gam=
e designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interested, for some time, in h=
ow QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; The first question to answ=
er is whether it is appropriate and lawful
 for domestic law enforcement to monitor and collect information about QAnon=
 and/or members of QAnon.<br>
<br>
Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect and maintain criminal=
 intelligence information concerning a group only if there is reasonable sus=
picion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal conduct or activity a=
nd the information is relevant to that criminal
 conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshall=
 not collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the politic=
al, religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individual=
 or any group, association, corporation, business,
 partnership, or other organization unless such information directly relates=
 to criminal conduct or activity and there is reasonable suspicion that the s=
ubject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct or activ=
ity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reasonable suspicion
 (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis established when informati=
on exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforceme=
nt or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a bas=
is to believe that there is a reasonable
 possibility that an individual or organization is involved in a definable c=
riminal activity or enterprise.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The fact that members of a group engage in criminal activities, even if larg=
e numbers or a majority of group members engage in criminal activities, is n=
ot sufficient to establish criminal predication for the group itself.&nbsp; =
For the group to be criminally predicated,
 members must be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furth=
erance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.<br>
<br>
This all matters to law enforcement because this analysis must be undertaken=
 when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect and maintain crimina=
l intelligence information on or initiate a criminal investigation of groups=
 such as the Anonymous Hacker
 Collective, the World Church of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (=
i.e. is it a club or gang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Ins=
ane Clown Posse when it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally predic=
ated group.<br>
<br>
As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to me that there are s=
everal examples of members engaging in criminal activity including crimes of=
 violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, and ideol=
ogy.&nbsp; The next question would be whether
 there are clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find wi=
th groups, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gan=
gs, or not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it woul=
d be necessary to forensically
 determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group are. &nbsp; <br=
>
<br>
Once identified, the next investigative step would be to collect evidence in=
 support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and leader(s) of QAnon had t=
he criminal intent for those crimes or other planned crimes to occur. &nbsp;=
 At this point it seems to all boil
 down to:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was and is the intent of those who originally o=
rganized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there criminal investigative and prosecutorial in=
terest in finding out?<br>
<br>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be safe,</div>
