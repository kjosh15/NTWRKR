Heh. I'm picturing a turn-of-the century lathe. A big green steel machine
with a cast iron flywheel.

When you said "Cable" I take it you meant "Belt"? Are we talking about a
rubber or leather band that transfers power from the motor to the spindle?
Are there teeth or holes like you'd find on a men's belt, or is it smooth?

You said the spindle turns freely, correct? If the spindle turns freely
then it sounds like you just put too much tension on the belt, which made
it too hard for the motor to get the spindle turning and the motor blew the
fuse. Or, you got the belt tension just right and the spindle isn't free.

Is the belt supple or has it gotten too dry?
