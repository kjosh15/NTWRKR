You are entirely correct except it=E2=80=99s blue. Rubber belt, not oxidize=
d and no
holes; it has ribs instead. Loosened it to the point that the belt didn=E2=
=80=99t
turn at all and slowly tightened it just to the point where it caught and
turned the spindle. Works like a charm.

Best part is the giant box full of tools to work it with; the woman who
lived here fit it out the attic with all kinds of  woodworking gear! It=E2=
=80=99s
def. hobbyist stuff (no freestanding band saws, etc.) but there=E2=80=99s a=
 lot I
could do here if I needed to.

Primarily I=E2=80=99ve just been using it as an excuse to go into a differe=
nt room
for 10m and do something with my hands in between editing pitch decks and
financing sheets. :P

I=E2=80=99ve contacted my NYC connections to get the crowbox kit from there=
. Stoked
to start jiggering something to work with the ravens!!
