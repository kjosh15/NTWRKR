         This recent discussion takes on a more sinister character since We=
dnesday's events. Prominent among the insurrectionists who stormed the Capi=
tol on Wednesday a few blocks from where I live were open followers of the =
QAnon alternative reality game/set of conspiracy theories/political movemen=
t. Notable among reports from the journalists inside the Capitol was the ca=
sual attitude the insurrectionists had to breaking Federal law; some even s=
aid they didn't appear to realize what they were doing was illegal or outra=
geous even as they beat and chased the building's defenders. Many did not s=
eem to understand the distinction between the Capitol being "the people's h=
ouse" and the Capitol and everything in it actually belonging to them. Vide=
o has surfaced of a man in a Q shirt chasing a Capitol police officer up th=
e stairs of the Capitol, and the shirtless man who stood on the House Dais =
and ranted is Jake Angeli, known online as "the QAnon Shaman." One woman wh=
o was interviewed after being maced seemed surprised and incensed that she =
had been assaulted by police just because, in her own words, she was only t=
rying to climb into the Capitol through a broken window to start a revoluti=
on.=20
         <br>

        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
         These people are utterly divorced from reality and a danger to the=
mselves, the rest of us, and to democracy. They and their actions on Wednes=
day have been enabled by grifters and politicians who have reinforced their=
 delusions. They are not a curiosity to marvel at, they are an extremist gr=
oup whose goal is overthrowing the government, and they have now taken dram=
atic, violent steps toward that end.=20
        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         Wednesday's well-documented events have made the United States a l=
aughing stock around the world and will stain our reputation for the rest o=
f our history. The next time someone tries to minimize these events, remind=
 yourself that=20
         <b>the United States Government lost control of the Capitol buildi=
ng to an extremist group for several hours</b>, resulting in at least five =
deaths, the defacing and theft of Federal property, forcing the evacuation =
of the Vice President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, and di=
srupting the democratic process during a joint session of Congress. Let's n=
ot mince words; this was a terrorist attack and there should be no excuse f=
or those who enabled it.
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         And yet, the disinformation persists. Beyond just the continued in=
sistence on disproven narratives about a fraudulent Presidential election, =
some lawmakers are now trying to claim that the Capitol was stormed by Anti=
fa, even as QAnon cult members responsible for the insurrection and identif=
ied in pictures are correcting them and bragging about what they did on soc=
ial media. Whatever political bias you may think technology firms may have,=
 we would not allow ISIS to recruit on Facebook. That any of those responsi=
ble for the insurrection are still free now is an incredible failure of law=
 enforcement and frankly, of national security.=20
        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         I include a picture that's making the rounds in right-wing circles=
 monitored by some colleagues of mine illustrating the latest emergent narr=
ative from Wednesday's events--they didn't actually happen at all, and ever=
yone involved is an Antifa crisis actor. No one actually stormed the Capito=
l, and it was all shot on a green screen somewhere in Hollywood. QAnon foll=
owers are also convinced that the President's video condemning the insurrec=
tion from yesterday is a deep fake, and the real President is still urging =
them on.=20

         There must be a breaking point to enabling and tolerating QAnon an=

              To me, it's bizarre to even be talking about LE monitoring QA=
non or any other conspiratorial intellectual milieus. Unless, of course, "l=
eaders" of such milieus - assuming there actually are any - are explicitly =
encouraging others to engage in violence or unless particular members are c=
learly planning to engage in such actions, even on their own initiative. Af=
ter all, we're not talking about hierarchical, tightly-structured, clandest=
ine organizations in this context, but merely virtual communities of people=
 who share certain eccentric beliefs. If every milieu that believed in cert=
ain peculiar political conspiracy theories was regarded as potentially "dan=
gerous," one could conceivably justify placing millions of people under sur=
veillance. Not for what they actually do, but merely for what they believe.=
 I don't think any of us would like to live in such a society, i.e., where =
"thought crimes" alone were punished.

              Reading the analysis of QAnon from the perspective of a game =
designer was fascinating.&nbsp; I have been interested, for some time, in h=
ow QAnon can be treated by law enforcement.&nbsp; The first question to ans=
wer is whether it is appropriate and lawful for domestic law enforcement to=
 monitor and collect information about QAnon and/or members of QAnon.
              <br>=20
              <br> Under 28 CFR =C2=A7 23.20, law enforcement can collect a=
nd maintain criminal intelligence information concerning a group only if th=
ere is reasonable suspicion that the group =E2=80=9Cis involved in criminal=
 conduct or activity and the information is relevant to that criminal condu=
ct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Further, law enforcement =E2=80=9Cshall not =
collect or maintain criminal intelligence information about the political, =
religious or social views, associations, or activities of any individual or=
 any group, association, corporation, business, partnership, or other organ=
ization unless such information directly relates to criminal conduct or act=
ivity and there is reasonable suspicion that the subject of the information=
 is or may be involved in criminal conduct or activity.=E2=80=9D &nbsp;Reas=
onable suspicion (also known as a criminal predicate) =E2=80=9Cis establish=
ed when information exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a tra=
ined law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer, investigator=
, or employee a basis to believe that there is a reasonable possibility tha=
t an individual or organization is involved in a definable criminal activit=
y or enterprise.=E2=80=9D
              <br>=20
              <br> The fact that members of a group engage in criminal acti=
vities, even if large numbers or a majority of group members engage in crim=
inal activities, is not sufficient to establish criminal predication for th=
e group itself.&nbsp; For the group to be criminally predicated, members mu=
st be engaging in crime at the direction of the group or in furtherance of =
the group=E2=80=99s goals, objectives, or ideologies.
              <br>=20
              <br> This all matters to law enforcement because this analysi=
s must be undertaken when determining if it is proper and lawful to collect=
 and maintain criminal intelligence information on or initiate a criminal i=
nvestigation of groups such as the Anonymous Hacker Collective, the World C=
hurch of the Creator, or a specific motorcycle club (i.e. is it a club or g=
ang).&nbsp; The FBI was unsuccessfully sued by the Insane Clown Posse when =
it determined that the Juggalos are a criminally predicated group.
              <br>=20
              <br> As I look at media reporting of QAnon, it seems clear to=
 me that there are several examples of members engaging in criminal activit=
y including crimes of violence in furtherance of the group=E2=80=99s goals,=
 objectives, and ideology.&nbsp; The next question would be whether there a=
re clear organizer(s) and leader(s) of the group such as you find with grou=
ps, such as the World Church of the Creator and outlaw motorcycle gangs, or=
 not as is you find with the Anonymous Hacker Collective. Then it would be =
necessary to forensically determine who those organizer(s) and leader(s) of=
 the group are. &nbsp;=20
              <br>=20
              <br> Once identified, the next investigative step would be to=
 collect evidence in support of probable cause that the organizer(s) and le=
ader(s) of QAnon had the criminal intent for those crimes or other planned =
crimes to occur. &nbsp; At this point it seems to all boil down to:
              <br>=20
              <br> 1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was and is the intent of th=
ose who originally organized QAnon and currently lead QAnon if such exist?
              <br>=20
              <br> 2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there criminal investigative =
and prosecutorial interest in finding out?
