Sonali,

I hope this email finds you and yours safe and healthy; it's been a hell of
a year.

Fortunately I'm writing with good news as I'm looking to learn more about
your placement services. My startup (www.indigometrics.com) needs to hire
our second tech position. We're currently in the middle of getting our
first raise, but we're profitable and want to get the interviews started.

The position is fully remote although we favor GMT and EST. We need someone
who can get up to speed on AWS microservices, optimize/converting our
existing codebase (Python backend / C# front end) to same while
collaborating on getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is
an ability to be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep
learning curves.

The upside is that we're currently working on DE&I with the biggest
construction firm in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 500
companies on a separate joint DE&I effort - the largest that I know of. If
we get it we'll be helping create systemic, public accountability for much
if not most of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel like we'd really
benefit from some more diverse representation in our team!!

A year ago I wouldn't have expected to be here, but the shift to
distributed workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We're seeing
appetites increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sharp to
join the team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about your
fee structure and how we could get started?

Finally - how the hell are you?? It's been a long time, and a weird year.
Let me know if you're game for a short call just to catch up some time!!

All best,
Josh
