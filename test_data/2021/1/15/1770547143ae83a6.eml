Back at you! Today has been very strange; I've still got the weight of the
last couple weeks but am strikingly calm and grounded. Like all the worries
and stressors are there, but ... attenuated? Smaller. It's been a great
relief and also just a simple settling into myself. I'm curious if this is
characteristic of journeying!

Will think on passing through the straits, thank you for this. Please let
me know how/when/if I can help in turn!

All best,
Josh
