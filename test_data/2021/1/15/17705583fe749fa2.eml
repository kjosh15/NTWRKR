we roll it out. When you have logged in you will see the option =E2=80=93 t=
hen just
type a name in the box and it will switch to emulation. There is old Rivel
data in UAT at the moment so you can look to see what Brian is seeing for
example. When finished with the emulation you need to log out and then log
back in as SA.
