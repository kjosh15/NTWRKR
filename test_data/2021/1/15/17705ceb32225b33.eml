Thanks =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99ve added some commentary below =E2=80=93 at =
some point we need to circle back and figure where we are going on =
contracts =E2=80=93 hopefully something we can do f2f!

Main realisation I=E2=80=99ve had is that we should switch to invoice at =
start of month rather than end =E2=80=93 and also ask for 6 months fees =
upfront on =E2=80=9Cgo live=E2=80=9D day =E2=80=93 we may get away with =
it!

Nice work, Chris. Signed, attached, with the following notes to you =
(please pause on delivery if substantial disagreement is raised from =
below):

1.4: Are you comfortable that this protects us from their emulating our =
service?
Think its as good as we are going to get =E2=80=93 it took some =
negotiation to get this far =E2=80=93 think we need to be increasingly =
watchful as we get more high profile on the subject of copying =E2=80=93 =
but think awareness and street smarts are our first line of defence =
=E2=80=93 not contract

3.4: Our security program has been in place for at least a year?
Strangely enough =E2=80=93 it has been =E2=80=93 I wrote the first WISPS =
in Feb 2020 =E2=80=93 time moves on=E2=80=A6.


6.1: This is a bit of a bitch! Not saying to stop as a result, just =
noting.
Which part is the bitch =E2=80=93 the 1% bit? We have to just luxuriate =
in the fees agreed on page 19 =E2=80=93 they are much better than =
through Lane 4

8.1: This makes sense but feels a bit aggressive. Pro-rated refunds are =
significant at our scale!
agreed =E2=80=93 but not relevant with them as we are invoicing in =
arears =E2=80=93 which is something we need to switch to advance! =
Hadn=E2=80=99t occurred to me we would get away with it!

8.2: Beautiful.
10: wtf? Any idea what this is for?
Their lawyer didn=E2=80=99t want to delete because it would mess up the =
numbers in his word doc!

12.1: This seems weirdly blanket given the above clauses?
Its US law boilerplate =E2=80=93 just means we (and they) can claim =
consequential loss =E2=80=93 so if we mess something up and upset Misha =
and he then crashes his car =E2=80=93 we don=E2=80=99t have to pay for =
the new car

13.3: Nice
13.7: Good to note on "click through" clause
14.1: This is new to me; I trust this doesn't materially affect our =
operations?

Exhibit 1: I take it this is all covered already?
Yes =E2=80=93 the new policy should cover it =E2=80=93 but it is a bit =
grey =E2=80=93 I wouldn=E2=80=99t be surprised if we submit our =
insurance contact and they ask us to change it =E2=80=93 but with the =
new insurer we can pick the phone up and get them to do that as they are =
used to US insurance law. I=E2=80=99m not sure whether they will read =
the entirety of our insurance contract in any case

Addendum 1: Very interesting work here, specifically in terms to the =
limits imposed on them for changes. Suspect we'll be coming back to this =
eventually.
This is the section of which I am proud!


Addendum 1.5: What band/#'s are we at now?

Who knows =E2=80=93 the definition of Production Date is negotiable! In =
reality if they do another 300 person pilot it will be Stage 1 but if =
they give us 10,000 people it will be production / Stage 2.



best,
Josh

P.S. When can we ask for approval to put their logo on our website?

J,

Final agreement attached =E2=80=93 are you OK to sign this and return to =
me? Think its good practice that I negotiate the contracts and then you =
review and sign? At least for major contracts =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99ll =
sign the smaller ones for speed?
