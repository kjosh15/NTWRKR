*TL;DR: Indigometrics is looking better and better (we may hit
profitability next quarter at current burn rates), but we still need to
make a raise to sustain intended growth. Know any VCs?*
I hope you and yours are well - it's a crazy, crazy time in the world right
now. I count myself lucky to be connected with folks like yourself who I
know are working to make it better.

On the immediate capital front I recently signed to cohost the new
Accenture & NYTimes flagship podcast, The Big Change. Turns out they'll be
promoting this heavily on The Daily (podcast) and related NY Times
properties. Not much money, but good brand exposure!

Longer term Indigometrics' leading customer has gone from 3 pilots to
asking to move to production immediately alongside making it the
centerpiece of their D&I initiatives. Chances are good they'll roll us out
to a couple different groups of 10k users each, meaning we'd be able to
cover our current (limited) burn rate indefinitely post-April.

That said, we still really need capital to staff up, improve our
architecture, and support our existing customer base while seeing
increasing appetite from resellers. Our L&D partner, Lane 4, have now
claimed us as the core of their differentiation which speaks very well of
our ability to add major value to any consultancy or corporate change
provider.

Which leads to our final goal; M&A. We're testing the waters with a couple
strategic partners (Workday and Salesforce) but expect VCs to be a better
source of short term funding due to incentive alignment. Based on current
feedback we need to realize growth over 2021 + build a staff base (for
acquihire appeal) before rejoining M&A discussions in 2022.

I hope you and yours are doing well. If I can be of any help whatsoever
please let me know. Together we can usher in big improvements over the
coming year(s)!!

All best,
Josh
