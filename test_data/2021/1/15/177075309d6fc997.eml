I think there's going to be an ongoing demand for meaning that vaccines
aren't going to ameliorate. I'll see about some text notes prior to our
next call, thanks!

Huge congratulations on Best Men's Stage Monologues; very nicely done and
well earned! Agreed that it's very exciting to hear their selection also -
will be curious to read it!

All best wishes,
Josh

are written for and about young people are taken seriously.
