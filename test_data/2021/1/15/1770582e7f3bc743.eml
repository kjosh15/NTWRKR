Happy new year!! I hope you and yours entered it safe and healthy.

I'm writing as I'm seeing a renewed interest in speaking engagements for
later this year and - as I'm sure you have - continuing growth in virtual
events. I wanted to get ahead of it all by making sure you have my latest
information (presskit attached), speeches (3 one-pagers attached), and
video clips (at www.josh.is).

Part of the excitement is due to Accenture and the NY Times contracting me
to host their flagship new business podcast, The Big Change, which will be
featured heavily on The Daily and across the NY Times' platforms.

At the same time, I'm hearing a lot more discussion around the need for
thought leadership from my C-suite clients across the Fortune 500, and know
that their staff will be hunting around online for me soon.

Let me know if I can provide any further info. We've seen a decade's worth
of technology adoption in a single year, the invention of literally dozens
of world-changing technologies, and a massive shift in the role businesses
are expected to play in society. Let's get busy!!

Looking forward to it,
Josh Klein
