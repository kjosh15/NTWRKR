One thing that may change this is if our existing lease (in the metal box
in the middle shelf in the living room) has a clause requiring 30 days
notice to terminate. Can you verify on the latest version of the lease?

Sorry for the last minute request; I was trying to revisit what your legal
rights (and our legal obligations) were and realized we'd never gotten this
one resolved - but it might really change our strategy!

best,
Josh
