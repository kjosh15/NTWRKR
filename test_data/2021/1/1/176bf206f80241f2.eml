Read it. Loved it. Lots there; some of it more noise than signal, but
several of these pieces hit that nerve of recognized truth, like a kid's
loose tooth or a knock to your funny bone. As you quoted me, there is
definitely a there there.

My first, practical suggestion is to go through them to improve the signal
quotient. If you can settle on a format (and my suspicion is that it is a
short paragraph of observation vs. fiction or poetry or story) then it
becomes a question of repeatability and distribution, which are
discoverable quantities.

I would also note that "settle on a format" here really means "find a way
to love and distill."

Looking forward to speaking again,
Josh
