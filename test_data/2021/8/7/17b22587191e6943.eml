Do I recall correctly that you made a simple vertical laptop stand for a
MacBook Air or equivalent? I have a new wireless keyboard and wanted a way
to prop up my MacBook Air as a display, and figured if you=E2=80=99d built =
one you
probably also went through all the potential online designs and chose the
best one. Any advice?

All best,
Josh
