I had a charming conversation with several of Arionbanki's staff and it
looks like if we want to use the bank's accounting software we need their
CC.

The good news is they're not that much - about 5k ISK / year - and although
we won't earn any points or anything we'll be fully integrated locally.
Downside is we won't earn points and the card may/may not charge us foreign
transaction fees when used abroad (so we ought to keep our US personal card
at least until we can verify that.)

If I'm going to continue managing the business finances and this card is
for personal expenses, do you mind going to the bank to get it?

xoxo,
Josh
