Susan,

Leslie Payne at Arabella Advisors introduced us in 2011, when I connected
you to a friend who was pursuing a sustainable farm initiative. Similarly,
I'm working on a proposal for an indoor vertical gigafarm attached to a
geothermal power plant here in Iceland at the moment, if that piques your
interest!

Otherwise apologies for any excess persistence, and thanks for the kind
note!

All best,
Josh
