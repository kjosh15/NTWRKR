Bill,

Please meet Jannie, our new contact at Penguin who's helping with the
Foundry bifurcation. She has a couple forms she needs from us and also
needs confirmation on how we want to split the residuals/royalties/etc. My
understanding was that this should be 50/50 - let me know otherwise and/or
how else I can help!

All best,
Josh
