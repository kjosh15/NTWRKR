Hey, Josh! Great hearing from you. Glad to hear you=E2=80=99re doing well. T=
hings in the acting world continue apace. While business has taken a hit sin=
ce the pandemic, it seems to finally be firing on all cylinders again, altho=
ugh I=E2=80=99m happy to have been able to work AT ALL during the last year a=
nd a half=E2=80=A6 Mostly video games and animation, but a sci-fi show I pro=
duced before lockdown finally found a home on DUST. It=E2=80=99s called ORBI=
TAL REDUX, and when we first shot it, it was performed and broadcast live in=
 one take, including all special effects and music. Definitely the highest h=
igh wire I=E2=80=99ve ever walked. If you=E2=80=99re interested in watching,=
 you can check it out here: https://www.watchdust.tv/details/26678
And if you like it, tell your friends!

Happy to be reconnected,

Yuri
