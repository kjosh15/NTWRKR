First, congrats on the sale of Blockfolio.

Second, if the dust has died down a bit it would be great to catch up. No
agenda, just I can imagine lots has changed and I=E2=80=99ve always enjoyed=
 our
conversations.

If things are still crazy I can loop back later. Either way, I hope you=E2=
=80=99re
doing well!

All best,
Josh
