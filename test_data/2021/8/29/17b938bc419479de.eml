When to Get a Flu Shot in 2021
The dog days of summer are just about coming to the end in the U.S. And whil=
e the fall may mean cool breezes and nice walks in the park, it should also m=
ark the arrival of the annual flu shot or spray. Getting vaccinated against t=
he flu remains one of the simplest and best things you can do for your healt=
h, especially in a world where covid-19 is unfortunately still around. This y=
ear, it=E2=80=99s probably best to get an influenza vaccine sooner than late=
r.
