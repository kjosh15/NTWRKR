Dear Keith and Josh,

As you both know, I=E2=80=99ve been professionally pausing for the past 4+ y=
ears out of respect and humility regarding my own unconscious ego mechanisms=
. I=E2=80=99ve been waiting for an inner-directed call to action if I were g=
oing to come back into the world of systems building. I=E2=80=99m at that po=
int now with the state of truth-seeking and truth-sensing, especially in sci=
ence and journalism. In my view both institutions are effectively broken bey=
ond repair. And if they were ever not broken, then now they have become so c=
orrupted as to be accelerating existential risks, not ameliorating them.

My perception of the core issues at this time in history are the meta-comple=
x of (at least):
1) perverse financial incentives
2) institutional capture across the board
3) inherent limitations of individual cognition / sense making
4) individual and collective spiral developmental levels=20

My perception of a possible antidote is a marketplace / wagering system of t=
ruth claims which binds truth to money and is designed to be antifragile w.r=
.t. this binding.

My vision is that of a DAO in which your betting track record over time give=
s you more influence on the signal of truth or falsity for any given claim i=
n the system. All activity has cost or risk associated with it for the indiv=
iduals, and it has significant financial reward possible. You can bet on you=
r own truth claims, other people=E2=80=99s claims or individuals themselves.=
 There=E2=80=99s a dynamic rating system for individuals similar to chess ra=
tings, and for individual claims (i.e. truth is a dynamic measurement that c=
an fluctuate over time as more data and arguments are brought in).

Like Bucky said, =E2=80=9CYou never change things by fighting the existing r=
eality=E2=80=A6 instead build a new model that makes the existing model obso=
lete.=E2=80=9D What I envision is a system would sit largely outside of the a=
ctual science and journalism taking place, but would be a sanctuary for earn=
est heterodox thinkers who are marginalized and demonetized by their institu=
tions and the establishment. At an emergent level, inconvenient truth would c=
ome out of the DAO and if there are people and institutions who care to use t=
he data, it=E2=80=99s there.

I=E2=80=99m sensitive to the fact that the way I=E2=80=99m thinking about ap=
proaching it could be total hogwash. My point in contacting you both is I wa=
nt a collaborative conversation to grope into what might be done about the s=
tate of affairs.=20

Interested in playing or at least helping me out?

=E2=80=94Rafe
