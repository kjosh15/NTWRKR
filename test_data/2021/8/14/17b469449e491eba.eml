Here's a montage of video clips over the first couple of days of Phase=20
1.  https://youtu.be/f4vf1EzYiiw

The Stellar Jays are already consistently landing on the box and taking the=
=20
peanuts (they have no interest in the cheetos).  The first day I put=20
approx. 15 peanuts in the basket and they were gone within a couple of=20
hours (I'm back to only put out 6 peanuts after the all-you-can-eat-buffet=
=20
special).  The Jays keep coming back looking for more peanuts.  They get=20
upset and squawk.  We think there are two Jays.  They don't seem to be=20
friends because they will chase each other off. =20

Today, we noticed that one of the Jays pecked at the basket window.  When I=
=20
went to check the basket later, I realized that there was one peanut lodged=
=20
in the quarter side slot.  The Jay had seen the peanut and was pecking at=
=20
it to try to shake it loose.

The Crows are much more skittish and suspicious of the box.  They won't=20
land on the box at all yet.  I continue to put cheetos on the floor and I=
=20
also put a couple on the perch.  They land on the rail above the box, walk=
=20
along the rail staring the box.  Then they'll jump down to the floor, walk=
=20
around still staring at the box.  Finally, will make a run at a cheeto on=
=20
the floor and scurry or fly away.  Then they started to get a little braver=
=20
and will rush the box and grab one off the top of the perch, but that's=20
rare.  They still will not land on the box.

Stuart the Stellar=E2=80=99s Jay is ready for Phase 2. He lands on the box=
=20
consistently and takes the peanuts (he still turns his nose up at the=20
Cheetos).

Agnes and Izzy are suspicious of the box and will only circle the box, rush=
=20
in and swipe a Cheeto off the top. I=E2=80=99m having to put Cheetos on top=
 and=20
around the outside to lure them closer to the box. They aren=E2=80=99t read=
y for=20
phase 2 yet. They have trust issues like their mistress.
