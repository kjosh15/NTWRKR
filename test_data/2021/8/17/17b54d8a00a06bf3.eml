Marc, Ashley,

I just spoke with the founder of Happily <https://teamhappily.com/>, an
event/XR Suite management firm. They're seeing a huge boom in converting
companies' unused conference rooms and lobbies into film studios for
content generation for multiple platforms and mediums. Seems like they
might be a handy drop-in utility for some of the content we were talking
about globally - let me know if an intro is useful or if you've got this
totally covered!

Otherwise hit me with any updates; we're starting to get into recording
more again which is super exciting - here's to even more killer episodes!

All best,
Josh

Thanks so much for the call yesterday! I wanted to follow up on the convers=
ation to echo what I had heard and to help frame up my thinking prior to yo=
ur sending any writeups/decks my way for feedback.
<br>
<br>
Based on what was discussed I noted four potentials:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Using video with the leaders we interview for the podcast to produce =
more multimodal material</b><br>
<br>
Building in a little extra time to create a human connection with the leade=
r before/after the call - to capture the leader as a real, relatable person=
 - is a big value-add, especially if we can capture and use that content el=
sewhere. Similarly, having 2-3 questions
 we could ask every leader, again to emphasize the human element, would pro=
duce some really interesting content that will emphasize the business mater=
ial it&#39;s paired with.=C2=A0

Whether these be 3-5 minute pieces on specific customers, partnerships, or =

For example, I recently spoke to your HR Data team, and they&#39;re doing s=

 employee behavior is changing management strategy. Again, it&#39;s the int=

 human experience that makes it interesting! And as long as we frame each p=
