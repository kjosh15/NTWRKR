I don't have an exact date, but I know I unsubscribed after each of his
prior emails. Is there a reason that wouldn't show up?

Similarly, when I Iook at the Lead Catcher, it still shows many of the
folks I've unsubscribed. Any tips on removing them from there soI can get
an at-a-glance on who is ACTUALLY a new lead?

Thanks!

&gt; Hey Josh!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I created a quick video to show you how you can tell the difference. Y=
ou<br>
can check it out here.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you are seeing replies from a prospect and saw them get a campaign<=
br>
email after they replied, I&#39;d love to take a look at that specific<br>
instance. To do that, I&#39;d need the prospect&#39;s email along with:<br>
&gt; 1. Screenshot of the reply in your inbox (not in Mailshake) with both =
the<br>
To: and From addresses fully expanded<br>
&gt; 2. Message ID of the reply message - Not sure where to find? Check out=
<br>
these guides: Google full email headers or Microsoft find Email Header OR<b=
r>
reach out to your mail provider&#39;s support team so they can help grab th=
at<br>
Message ID for you.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you have multiple replies that aren&#39;t getting picked up 2-3 rec=
ipient<br>
examples would be helpful so we can investigate.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Once we have that information, we&#39;ll be able to investigate and pi=
npoint<br>
what might be the cause of the reply not getting picked up. Thank you so<br=
>
much for your help with this!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Josh,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; When someone becomes a Lead (meaning they show up in your Lead=

all follow up and on click messages you have set up in your campaign will<b=

stop getting sent to them. Even if you mark those leads as won or lost, the=
<br>
follow up messages will stop getting sent to them.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have drip messages set up in a campaign sequence, you w=

those continue to send to a prospect even after they become a lead.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can read more about the different types of campaign messag=

What kinds of campaign messages are there?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I&#39;m not understanding what a lead is - my experi=

that when someone lands in my Lead Catcher and I mark them as &quot;Won&quo=

&quot;Lost&quot; they continue to get followup emails unless I unsubscribe =
them<br>
(which obviously messes with my records of who to contact in future<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Josh,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for sending those over. When I look at that spe=
cific prospect,<br>
I&#39;m not see any campaign sequence emails having sent after they became =
a<br>
lead but I do see an unsubscribe event recorded. I think that may be what<b=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not seeing any leads in your current #12 campa=

like you have it set up to mark them as a lead when they reply. Once they<b=

become a lead, that will stop any follow up or on click messages from<br>
getting sent to them.<br>

                <div>Maybe I&#39;m not understanding what a lead is - my ex=
perience has been that when someone lands in my Lead Catcher and I mark the=
m as &quot;Won&quot; or &quot;Lost&quot; they continue to get followup emai=
ls unless I unsubscribe them (which obviously messes with my records of who=
 to contact in future campaigns.) Am I right that this shouldn&#39;t happen=
?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Josh<br>
