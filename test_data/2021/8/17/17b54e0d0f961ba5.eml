Trying to keep out of your inbox as much as possible, but just came across
this
<https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-diabetes-covid/>
reuters
article, which stated that roughly half of the US Covid deaths were people
with diabetes.

I'd like to solve for that and think I have a path to do it. Do you think I
should just reach out to some specific connections, or is this something
W50 might play a role in?

All best,
Josh
