Awesome, thanks! So good to hear from you again, and very exciting to see
how Happily is growing. Give me a bit to circle back around with my
cofounder to see if we could help you, and if not directly then to pitch
your XR studio system to our clients for ongoing internal comms. I've
attached our deck in kind (and we have an overview video here
<http://indigometrics.com>); if you have clients who'd like to see what the
impact of their spend is on actual employee behavior we can give them all
the data they need.

All best,
Josh
