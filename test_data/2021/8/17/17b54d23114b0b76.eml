Hey, here's a weird one. The article we're submitting to HBR doesn't have
an author. We don't want our name on it b/c we want it to reflect
positively on us as references inside the piece. The client is likely to
feel the same. Will HBR publish it under the name of one of their own
authors, or do we need to find someone to play author for us? Any thoughts?

And here I thought journalism was simple!

- J

P.S. Did you pull off those shrimp squats??
