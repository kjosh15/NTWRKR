Leigh Anne, thanks so much for sharing these videos - I loved the cast list
especially. ;)

The Blue Jay / Crow conflict is a weird one; my impression is that crows
are generally happy to watch jays risk their necks until they're fully
convinced everything is safe. The other thing to note is that very often
jays will cache very close nearby, and the crows will then just raid the
jay's cache - let us know if you see something like that!

Otherwise I'd say you're on the right track; keep at it and see if the
crows eventually decide it's safe to give the box a try, or if the jays
make the leap to the final stage.

Does anybody else have any thoughts?

- J
