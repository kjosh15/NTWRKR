Phillip,

If you're going to propose a VC function for W50 it should be easy to get
an export <https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=3D000339702&type=3D=
1>
of contacts from Salesforce as an overview of the entire W50 client base so
you can do a rough swag of potential investors/partners. It's such a
compelling idea, and so damn timely - all the members I've spoken to over
the past year are digging much deeper into CVC and M&A, so it's an ideal
time to leverage the W50 position as convener! Let me know if you need any
help in pulling this together!

All best,
Josh
