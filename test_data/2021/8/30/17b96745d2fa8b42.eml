If you spend enough time on the internet, you=E2=80=99ve probably heard the=
 term
=E2=80=98meme stock=E2=80=99. You may have also heard of diamond hands, ten=
dies, apes, and
/r/wallstreetbets

>.
Maybe you=E2=80=99ve even seen teenaged =E2=80=98investment advisors=E2=80=
=99 shilling SafeMoon and
hotel soap on TikTok. These terms and concepts are all part of what is
often described as the meme economy.

In the meme economy, the market performance of a stock or cryptocurrency is
less about forecasting business revenue than it is about gauging a traded
asset=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cmemeability.=E2=80=9D This user-generated, viralit=
y-based investment
strategy can best be explained by Ren=C3=A9 Girard=E2=80=99s mimetic theory=
 of desire
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt8kp>, which argues that
=E2=80=9Chuman desire is not an autonomous process, but a collective one. W=
e want
things because other people want them.=E2=80=9D And when those things are a=
lso
scarce, like stocks or NFTs, they become immensely valuable.

Mimetic desire causes people to invest *en masse* into things that they
have little knowledge of beyond who else is a part of the movement. The
social proof provided by friends and influencers creates a network effect
that, especially when combined with a genuine value proposition, is
powerful enough to commandeer entire financial markets.

*=E2=80=9CWhile traditional investing moves along the lines of traditional =
media
(be it TV, Radio, or also online publications with a top-down approach),
meme investing instead has developed as a result of =E2=80=9Cuser-generated=
=E2=80=9D
investment strategies. The platforms to communicate have been Reddit and
Twitter.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 Gennaro, **Understanding Meme Economy*
<https://hackernoon.com/understanding-meme-economy-eb4z35en>

For a real-world example of this in action, look no further than the GameSt=
op
and Dogecoin phenomena
<https://www.coindesk.com/gamestop-dogecoin-new-market-paradigm>, driven by
the /r/wallstreetbets subreddit <https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets>. With
Wall Street Bets, Redditors have fashioned an entire political movement out
of what began as a proudly degenerate investing subculture. Members share
an innate distrust of centralized financial markets fueled by what they
characterize as blatant government corruption, lack of transparency, and
institutionalized market manipulation.

The /r/wallstreetbets crowd views the meme investing crusade as an
opportunity to take back power. Many of the top posts
<https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/top/?t=3Dall> on the subreddit are
firebrand political statements in the form of memes, petitions, and literal
class action lawsuits, and it has quickly become one of the most cohesive
political movements to ever form on the internet. If prices are already
completely decoupled from intrinsic value because institutions,
governments, and billionaires manipulate markets for their own benefit, why
should regular people be criticized or prevented from banding together to
do the same?

=E2=80=9CMemes are fun and memes are also something to come together around=
.
Speculating on the popularity of memes and their staying power is no
different than any other form of speculation=E2=80=A6 I=E2=80=99ve decided =
that I am going
to stop ignoring and dismissing meme investing and start trying to
understand it better. I think it is not something that is going away
anytime soon and may turn into something even more interesting.=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=94 Fred
Wilson, Meme Investing <https://avc.com/2021/06/meme-investing/>

While the Gamestop and Dogecoin phenomena are powerful signals, the endgame
Fred Wilson alludes to, perhaps unknowingly, is the ability to *invest in
memes themselves*.
A Brief History of the Meme Market

The idea of a meme economy long predates /r/wallstreetbets and GameStop.
Before Redditors hit on the idea of meme-driven investing in real stocks,
there was a thriving but fake marketplace for actual memes online =E2=80=94=
 a kind
of =E2=80=9Cfantasy baseball=E2=80=9D version of a meme market, but without=
 real money
changing hands.

The Know Your Meme definition <https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-economy>
is instructive: =E2=80=9C[The] Meme Economy is a satirical concept and inte=
rnet
subculture in which memes are discussed in the jargons of the financial
industry, as if they are commodities or capital assets with fluctuating
values.=E2=80=9D

The subreddit r/MemeEconomy <https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/> now
boasts 1.4 million followers =E2=80=94 self-proclaimed =E2=80=9Cmeme analys=
ts=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 each
dedicated to uncovering and =E2=80=9Cinvesting=E2=80=9D in the memes that t=
hey believe have
the most viral potential.

These meme =E2=80=9Cinvestors=E2=80=9D are competitive, with Forbes having =
published a
ranking of the community=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ctop investors.=E2=80=9D
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/priceonomics/2017/07/25/ranking-the-top-inves=
tors-in-the-meme-economy/?sh=3D693464f45edc>
There are even in-depth guides to help usher in novice meme traders. For
instance, A Beginner=E2=80=99s Guide to the MemeEconomy and Meme Trading
<https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/5lk964/a_beginners_guide_to_=
the_memeeconomy_and_meme/>
advises new meme traders as follows:

=E2=80=9CKeep a sharp eye out, and don=E2=80=99t rely too heavily on the co=
mmunity to
cherry pick all the profitable memes for you. Do your own research and hunt
them yourself every once in a while. Doing this will grow your aptitude for
picking out the freshest and dankest memes. Not only will you be one of the
first to stumble upon the next possible meme trend, but there is also a
sense of satisfaction knowing that you were there in the beginning.=E2=80=
=9D

Meme markets like NASDANQ and MemeTrades even offered the first online
stock brokerage platforms for internet memes and were =E2=80=9Cequipped wit=
h basic
functionality, such as buying and selling memes and setting firms=E2=80=9D =
(source
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-economy>).

offered =E2=80=9Cvarious insights and advice on the market conditions of me=

exchange in the vein of financial news magazines like Forbes.=E2=80=9D

But without real money involved, these platforms were unable to offer much
more than a gimmick (despite their popularity). Memes had no real monetary
value, until=E2=80=A6
NFTs

NFTs have opened the door to digital collectibles in a way that was never
before possible. I won=E2=80=99t spend time extolling the virtues of NFTs
themselves here, but =E2=80=9CA Beginner's Guide to NFTs
<https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb=

by Linda Xie and The skeptics=E2=80=99 introduction to cryptoart and NFTs f=
or
digital artists and designers
<https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/> are both excellent
introductions to an industry that had a sales volume of $2.5 billion in the
first half of 2021.

Some of the most successful NFT projects like NBA Top Shot
<https://nbatopshot.com/>, the PUNKS comic <https://punkscomic.com/>, and
the myriad crypto-art platforms
<https://www.cryptoartnet.com/cryptoart-sites/marketplaces-platforms/> have
succeeded in replicating and vastly improving upon their real-world/meat
space <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=3Dmeatspace>
collectible counterparts: basketball trading cards, comic books, and
physical art. Seeing their value as NFTs is conceptually simple given that
they each already have a physical equivalent.

What has begun more recently, though, is the NFT-ization of digitally
native content =E2=80=94 the things which have never had a physical counter=
part,
like memes and viral videos.

The meme economy has quickly become a reality, with the creators of the
internet=E2=80=99s most iconic memes auctioning NFTs for hundreds of thousa=
nds, if
not millions of dollars: Doge =E2=80=94 $4 million, Disaster Girl =E2=80=94=
 $570,000, Nyan
Cat =E2=80=94 $515,000. The list goes on (check out my collection
<https://foundation.app/@a>!)

The most valuable collectibles will always be the most culturally
significant ones, and there is nothing more culturally significant on the
internet than memes. And love it or hate it, NFT memes have the media=E2=80=
=99s
undivided attention. Here=E2=80=99s just a tiny sampling:

   - *Mashable*: Classic memes that have sold as NFTs
   <https://mashable.com/article/classic-memes-sold-nft-prices>

Each massive auction reflects the fact that there has never been a medium
that embodies and influences the public consciousness quite like memes.
Memes are art and have revolutionized the way we communicate. Rosanna
Guadagno, researcher at the Pace Innovation Lab at Stanford University,
argues that memes are a =E2=80=9Creflection of our culture
<https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17760170/memes-good-behavioral-science-=
nazi-pepe>
=E2=80=9D.

Meme creators who sell NFTs are not greedy hyper-capitalists looking to
scam unwitting buyers. They are regular people who, often without their
permission, became universally recognized cultural symbols (and sometimes
laughingstocks) without any monetary reward=E2=80=A6 and now they=E2=80=99r=
e finally
getting the payout they deserve.

Unlike sports cards and NBA Top Shot, where players are rewarded with
little to none of the proceeds from the sales of their valuable
collectibles (which are only valuable because of their talent), meme
creators are the direct beneficiaries of sales.

Zo=C3=AB Roth, the subject of =E2=80=9CDisaster Girl=E2=80=9D, described he=
r auction
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html> as =

over since she was in elementary school,=E2=80=9D with every societal =E2=

.

In the same article, Kyle Craven (Bad Luck Brian) described NFTs as =E2=80=

only thing that memes can do to take control.=E2=80=9D
The Future of the Meme Economy

In the not-too-distant future, every meme will begin as an NFT, and it will
be possible to invest in memes before they go viral. The more legendary
memes will sell for the kinds of large sums we=E2=80=99re seeing right now =
in NFTs,
but investing in nascent memes will be accessible to investors without deep
pockets.

The free and open meme economy will enable savvy memesters to use existing
memes as on-chain templates, rewarding the original creator with ownership
in the new meme. We=E2=80=99ll even be able to trace a meme=E2=80=99s distr=
ibution/=E2=80=99spread=E2=80=99
in real-time as it=E2=80=99s engaged with, invested in, and templated.

Memers are already becoming millionaires (deservedly so), and it=E2=80=99s =
only a
matter of time before it will be possible to make a lucrative career for
oneself out of meme creation and curation.

Eventually, all intellectual property rights will take the form of NFTs, a
development that Jake Brukhman argues
<https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a707165=
7>
will make NFTs =E2=80=9Cthe biggest asset class in blockchain.=E2=80=9D

Believe me when I say that we=E2=80=99re well on our way.

The meme economy will become real.

- Meme creators will make NFTs
- Timestamps give proof-of-first
- Memegen partially goes on-chain
- Memetic spread is more traceable
- Memers become millionaires
- Risky art becomes uncensorable & monetizable
- Art moves outside regime control
