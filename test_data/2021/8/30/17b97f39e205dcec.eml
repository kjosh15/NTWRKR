Happy to connect if you want to kick the idea around! Then again, you
probably have access to the best Executives to vet the idea in the world!
I'd suggest you get a master list of all the W50 members and sort them by
industry and investment activity (CB insights and TechCrunch can both get
you some stats for this.) Then you can create an overview of the total
market value potentially brought to bear on the investment/acquisition
side... if that doesn't open doors for W50 nothing will.
