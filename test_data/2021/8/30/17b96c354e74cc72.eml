Phillip,

I got a hold of my friend who did the back end development on Wikipedia's
most recent build to better understand the situation over there before I
reach out to either Jimmy or their CMO (there's some political tension
between the roles). I'll keep you posted, but suspect it's going to be a
matter of finding the right person to push.

In the meantime, I'd like to see if the CGM project has any legs. I'm keen
to find a single corporate sponsor to pay for the whole thing in exchange
for exclusive right of first refusal on licensing; if it works, we'll
replicate the scaled bayesian filtering model for UX impact isolation and
target similar emerging platforms.

A J&J or Novo Nordisk seem ideal, but I'm certainly open to suggestions. Do
you know who/how I should approach? Any advice appreciated - I just need to
know if there's potential for the project right now!

Here's
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=3Dsharing>
the
latest deck; partners to execute aren't the problem - we need partners who
can provide access to study participants and operational capital and who
can utilize our results!

Gratefully,
Josh

P.S. Really enjoyed our last call. Let me know if it'd be useful to kick
ideas around again sometime!
