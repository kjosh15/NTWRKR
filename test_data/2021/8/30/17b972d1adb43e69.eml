(Hola hola, still in Spain at my mom's, flying back tomorrow. I found a
treasure of a letter that I sent you right after you met Hulda that was
returned to me. I am keeping it in my suitcase as a charm for foreverrrr
now. It includes the sentence: "how is it going with the love of your
life?" -I know, try not to cry- )


Let's see, I am going to give you the name of a recruiter that you can ping
(and your friend can let her know I passed her name along, I have worked
with this person for years and it is someone that will understand the
importance of a  candidate that is truly interested). Now, does your friend
have any experience with a community based organization, say something like
RedHat or open source (something like say, Tomcat, Open JDK) or with
organizations that have a militant presence when it comes to politics of
equality, say Amnesty International? I am asking cause in the absence of
experience with something on that avenue it is very likely he will not be
considered. The number of applicants for Wikipedia's positions is always
very large but very few have any experience with a large community-based
project (most focus just in the 'big website' aspect).

Thus, this being said, your friend can contact
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahroth1/ and get a feeling for what is
sought after to be a successful candidate. Sarah is a pro and
wiil hopefully have some time to talk to your friend.

Ciaooooo
