Hi Josh

The below is exceptionally helpful. Thank you for that!

Your second point is great, so I know what to listen for and where is best
for me to plug you into conversations.

For potential members, we look for organizations mostly above $5B in
revenue with the highest level within their function. For our community,
the majority of the members report directly to the CEO and lead innovation,
R&D, massive transformation, etc. All the titles are extremely different.
The major aspect is that they look for and value external perspectives. I
am happy to speak with anyone you think might be a potential fit or I can
do a little digging if there is someone you are not sure of.

The book club idea is interesting as well. I am going to bring that to our
membership experience team who sends out the books to see if they have
looked into something similar.

Again, I appreciate the below!

Talk soon,
Elyse
