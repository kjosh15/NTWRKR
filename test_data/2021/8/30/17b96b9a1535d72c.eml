I have a friend who recently applied; he's an AWESOME human being with an
incredible ability to connect with people and is very aligned with the
mission. Is there anyone I can/should ping to encourage them to take
another look at his submission? (He got a boilerplate "we'll get back to
you if there's interest" response.)

Many thanks - hope you all are doing well!!

- J
