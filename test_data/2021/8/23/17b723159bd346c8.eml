Daniel,

Thanks so much for the call on Friday; it was very helpful to learn more
about what you're building inside of EY.

On the call your team asked about matching hard KPIs to our behavior data.
We're actually working with a client of yours, Sky, to do exactly this. The
data comes straight out of their HR system, and as EY does culture
transformation, we add soft skill data that matches directly to EY's. Let
me know if you'd like more info and I'll work with our team at Sky to get
it.

Finally, if you could put me in touch with your client-facing teams I'd
love to explore the potential for partnership. I've attached our
overview deck and a short video is available on our site
<http://www.indigometrics.com>; let me know if I can provide any additional
information that might be helpful!

Gratefully,
Josh
