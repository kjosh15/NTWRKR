Hi Josh,

I am so sorry for the delay in responding.
I wasn't sure if you are sending the mass emails to a bunch of people.
I'd love to hear what is going on with you so like to chat, but its been
really busy
with my own film project with deadlines and TV work...

but happy to re-connect to chat briefly in the next couple of weeks!

Thank you for thinking of me and look forward to speaking with you in
person :)

Warm regards,

Shiho Kataoka
