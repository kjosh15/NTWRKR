Yes, that's the correct formula of Sci-Grip. You'll definitely need a
needle applicator like that little bottle. This shit evaporates nearly
instantly, so it's difficult and wasteful to apply using any other tool. An
applicator lets you make sure the cement hits the plastic at the same time
as the air. Versus trying to pick the cement up on a brush and get it to
the plastic before it all just evaporates off the brush.

If you want, I can shatter some pieces of acrylic from the shop and make a
little video that demonstrates the restoration process?

I want to find my spare Crowbox parts (or cut you some new ones) but it's a
terrible time for that. In one week a crew of contractors is grinding my
shop floor and applying Polyurea floor coating. It's going to be awesome
but right now I'm working hard to get everything in the shop packed away,
so I'm not able to go digging for stuff right now, and my laser has already
been wheeled into the garage, where it stays until the shop floor is done.
Then I have to take all the shit from the garage and put it into the shop
so we can have the polyurea applied to the garage floor.

Things are alright. We have a new puppy, a French Bulldog, which brings us
to a total of three dogs. So it's a bit of a pain in the ass right now. Our
German Shepherd is huge and pays no attention to what's around him when he
moves, so the bulldog has to be watched at all times because he doesn't
know to stay out of the way. The bulldog should put on 10 pounds in the
next couple of months and then we won't have to worry so much about him
getting flattened. But as it stands right now, Dani and I have to negotiate
who is watching the dogs while another does something, so it's a bit
constraining. And most of what I'd normally call "spare time" is spent
getting the shop ready to have its floor coated.

I have a couple ideas for neat little gadgets to build but, again, no
progress on any projects until the shop is done. I'm trying to find a
contractor to frame out a box inside the shop... an "office" type
room-within-the-big-room where I can better control temperature and dust.
(Sawdust). This is where I want to set up the computers, soldering station,
laser cutter, and 3d printer... stuff that needs to be protected thermally
and kept from dust contamination. BUT. Coeur D'Alene is a growing very
quickly at the moment. Property values nearly doubled mid-pandemic and
folks have refinanced and are pouring a bunch of that money back into
remodels and improvements, so there are a couple of classes of contractors
that are impossible to hire right now- booked solid through the end of the
year. So that's frustrating. I wanted to get my whole shop done this summer
but it looks like I'll get the floors done and nothing else.
