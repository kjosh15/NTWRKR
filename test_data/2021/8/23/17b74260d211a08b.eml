Harry Jones is Meme Tsar at Dank Bank [https://dankbank.co/], the stock mar=
ket for memes.=20

If you spend enough time on the internet, you=E2=80=99ve probably heard the=
 term =E2=80=98meme stock=E2=80=99. You may have also heard of diamond hand=
s, tendies, apes, and /r/wallstreetbets [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/=
tendies-diamond-hands-your-guide-to-the-lingo-on-wallstreetbets-the-reddit-=
forum-fueling-gamestops-rise-11611780829]. Maybe you=E2=80=99ve even seen t=
eenaged =E2=80=98investment advisors=E2=80=99 shilling SafeMoon and hotel s=
oap on TikTok. These terms and concepts are all part of what is often descr=
ibed as the meme economy.

In the meme economy, the market performance of a stock or cryptocurrency is=
 less about forecasting business revenue than it is about gauging a traded =
asset=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cmemeability.=E2=80=9D This user-generated, viralit=
y-based investment strategy can best be explained by Ren=C3=A9 Girard=E2=80=
=99s mimetic theory of desire [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7=
zt8kp], which argues that =E2=80=9Chuman desire is not an autonomous proces=
s, but a collective one. We want things because other people want them.=E2=
=80=9D And when those things are also scarce, like stocks or NFTs, they bec=
ome immensely valuable.

Mimetic desire causes people to invest en masse into things that they have =
little knowledge of beyond who else is a part of the movement. The social p=
roof provided by friends and influencers creates a network effect that, esp=
ecially when combined with a genuine value proposition, is powerful enough =
to commandeer entire financial markets.

> =E2=80=9CWhile traditional investing moves along the lines of traditional=
 media (be it TV, Radio, or also online publications with a top-down approa=
ch), meme investing instead has developed as a result of =E2=80=9Cuser-gene=
rated=E2=80=9D investment strategies. The platforms to communicate have bee=
n Reddit and Twitter.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8AGennaro, Understan=
ding Meme Economy [https://hackernoon.com/understanding-meme-economy-eb4z35=
en]
For a real-world example of this in action, look no further than the GameSt=
op and Dogecoin phenomena [https://www.coindesk.com/gamestop-dogecoin-new-m=
arket-paradigm], driven by the /r/wallstreetbets subreddit [https://reddit.=
com/r/wallstreetbets]. With Wall Street Bets, Redditors have fashioned an e=
ntire political movement out of what began as a proudly degenerate investin=
g subculture. Members share an innate distrust of centralized financial mar=
kets fueled by what they characterize as blatant government corruption, lac=
k of transparency, and institutionalized market manipulation.

The /r/wallstreetbets crowd views the meme investing crusade as an opportun=
ity to take back power. Many of the top posts [https://www.reddit.com/r/wal=
lstreetbets/top/?t=3Dall] on the subreddit are firebrand political statemen=
ts in the form of memes, petitions, and literal class action lawsuits, and =
it has quickly become one of the most cohesive political movements to ever =
form on the internet. If prices are already completely decoupled from intri=
nsic value because institutions, governments, and billionaires manipulate m=
arkets for their own benefit, why should regular people be criticized or pr=
evented from banding together to do the same?

> =E2=80=9CMemes are fun and memes are also something to come together arou=
nd. Speculating on the popularity of memes and their staying power is no di=
fferent than any other form of speculation=E2=80=A6 I=E2=80=99ve decided th=
at I am going to stop ignoring and dismissing meme investing and start tryi=
ng to understand it better. I think it is not something that is going away =
anytime soon and may turn into something even more interesting.=E2=80=9D=E2=
=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8AFred Wilson, Meme Investing [https://avc.com/2021/0=
6/meme-investing/]
While the Gamestop and Dogecoin phenomena are powerful signals, the endgame=
 Fred Wilson alludes to, perhaps unknowingly, is the ability to invest in m=
emes themselves.

A Brief History of the Meme Market
The idea of a meme economy long predates /r/wallstreetbets and GameStop. Be=
fore Redditors hit on the idea of meme-driven investing in real stocks, the=
re was a thriving but fake marketplace for actual memes online =E2=80=94 a =
kind of =E2=80=9Cfantasy baseball=E2=80=9D version of a meme market, but wi=
thout real money changing hands.

The Know Your Meme definition [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-economy]=
 is instructive: =E2=80=9C[The] Meme Economy is a satirical concept and int=
ernet subculture in which memes are discussed in the jargons of the financi=
al industry, as if they are commodities or capital assets with fluctuating =
values.=E2=80=9D

The subreddit r/MemeEconomy [https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/] now boa=
sts 1.4 million followers =E2=80=94 self-proclaimed =E2=80=9Cmeme analysts=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 each dedicated to uncovering and =E2=80=9Cinvesting=E2=
=80=9D in the memes that they believe have the most viral potential.

These meme =E2=80=9Cinvestors=E2=80=9D are competitive, with Forbes having =
published a ranking of the community=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ctop investors.=E2=
=80=9D [https://www.forbes.com/sites/priceonomics/2017/07/25/ranking-the-to=
p-investors-in-the-meme-economy/?sh=3D693464f45edc] There are even in-depth=
 guides to help usher in novice meme traders. For instance, A Beginner=E2=
=80=99s Guide to the MemeEconomy and Meme Trading [https://www.reddit.com/r=
/MemeEconomy/comments/5lk964/a_beginners_guide_to_the_memeeconomy_and_meme/=
] advises new meme traders as follows:

> =E2=80=9CKeep a sharp eye out, and don=E2=80=99t rely too heavily on the =
community to cherry pick all the profitable memes for you. Do your own rese=
arch and hunt them yourself every once in a while. Doing this will grow you=
r aptitude for picking out the freshest and dankest memes. Not only will yo=
u be one of the first to stumble upon the next possible meme trend, but the=
re is also a sense of satisfaction knowing that you were there in the begin=
ning.=E2=80=9D
Meme markets like NASDANQ and MemeTrades even offered the first online stoc=
k brokerage platforms for internet memes and were =E2=80=9Cequipped with ba=
sic functionality, such as buying and selling memes and setting firms=E2=80=
=9D (source [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-economy]).

Meme Insider [https://memeinsider.com/], a dedicated meme magazine, also of=
fered =E2=80=9Cvarious insights and advice on the market conditions of meme=
 exchange in the vein of financial news magazines like Forbes.=E2=80=9D

But without real money involved, these platforms were unable to offer much =
more than a gimmick (despite their popularity). Memes had no real monetary =
value, until=E2=80=A6

NFTs
NFTs have opened the door to digital collectibles in a way that was never b=
efore possible. I won=E2=80=99t spend time extolling the virtues of NFTs th=
emselves here, but =E2=80=9CA Beginner's Guide to NFTs [https://linda.mirro=
r.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d%20ht=
tps://t.co/1YJbdCCTcQ?amp=3D1]=E2=80=9D by Linda Xie and The skeptics=E2=80=
=99 introduction to cryptoart and NFTs for digital artists and designers [h=
ttps://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/] are both excellent introdu=
ctions to an industry that had a sales volume of $2.5 billion in the first =
half of 2021.

Some of the most successful NFT projects like NBA Top Shot [https://nbatops=
hot.com/], the PUNKS comic [https://punkscomic.com/], and the myriad crypto=
-art platforms [https://www.cryptoartnet.com/cryptoart-sites/marketplaces-p=
latforms/] have succeeded in replicating and vastly improving upon their re=
al-world/meat space [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=3Dmeat=
space] collectible counterparts: basketball trading cards, comic books, and=
 physical art. Seeing their value as NFTs is conceptually simple given that=
 they each already have a physical equivalent.

What has begun more recently, though, is the NFT-ization of digitally nativ=
e content=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Athe things which have never had a physi=
cal counterpart, like memes and viral videos.

The meme economy has quickly become a reality, with the creators of the int=
ernet=E2=80=99s most iconic memes auctioning NFTs for hundreds of thousands=
, if not millions of dollars: Doge=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8A$4 million, Di=
saster Girl=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8A$570,000, Nyan Cat=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=8A$515,000. The list goes on (check out my collection [https://found=
ation.app/@a]!)

The most valuable collectibles will always be the most culturally significa=
nt ones, and there is nothing more culturally significant on the internet t=
han memes. And love it or hate it, NFT memes have the media=E2=80=99s undiv=
ided attention. Here=E2=80=99s just a tiny sampling:

Each massive auction reflects the fact that there has never been a medium t=
hat embodies and influences the public consciousness quite like memes. Meme=
s are art and have revolutionized the way we communicate. =E2=80=8ARosanna =
Guadagno, researcher at the Pace Innovation Lab at Stanford University, arg=
ues that memes are a =E2=80=9Creflection of our culture [https://www.thever=
ge.com/2018/8/27/17760170/memes-good-behavioral-science-nazi-pepe]=E2=80=9D.

Meme creators who sell NFTs are not greedy hyper-capitalists looking to sca=
m unwitting buyers. They are regular people who, often without their permis=
sion, became universally recognized cultural symbols (and sometimes laughin=
gstocks) without any monetary reward=E2=80=A6 and now they=E2=80=99re final=
ly getting the payout they deserve.

Unlike sports cards and NBA Top Shot, where players are rewarded with littl=
e to none of the proceeds from the sales of their valuable collectibles (wh=
ich are only valuable because of their talent), meme creators are the direc=
t beneficiaries of sales.

Zo=C3=AB Roth, the subject of =E2=80=9CDisaster Girl=E2=80=9D, described he=
r auction [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.h=
tml] as =E2=80=9Ca way for her to take control over a situation that she ha=
s felt powerless over since she was in elementary school,=E2=80=9D with eve=
ry societal =E2=80=98disaster=E2=80=99 inevitably prompting a resurgence in=
 the meme. She called it =E2=80=9Ca once-in-a-lifetime feeling=E2=80=9D to =
=E2=80=9Cfinally [have] some say in what happened with [the meme].=E2=80=9D=
 Zo=C3=AB was able to pay off her student loans after Disaster Girl sold at=
 auction for $500,000, then donated much of the rest to charity.

In the same article, Kyle Craven (Bad Luck Brian) described NFTs as =E2=80=
=9Cthe only thing that memes can do to take control.=E2=80=9D

The Future of the Meme Economy
In the not-too-distant future, every meme will begin as an NFT, and it will=
 be possible to invest in memes before they go viral. The more legendary me=
mes will sell for the kinds of large sums we=E2=80=99re seeing right now in=
 NFTs, but investing in nascent memes will be accessible to investors witho=
ut deep pockets.

The free and open meme economy will enable savvy memesters to use existing =
memes as on-chain templates, rewarding the original creator with ownership =
in the new meme. We=E2=80=99ll even be able to trace a meme=E2=80=99s distr=
ibution/=E2=80=99spread=E2=80=99 in real-time as it=E2=80=99s engaged with,=
 invested in, and templated.

Memers are already becoming millionaires (deservedly so), and it=E2=80=99s =
only a matter of time before it will be possible to make a lucrative career=
 for oneself out of meme creation and curation.

Eventually, all intellectual property rights will take the form of NFTs, a =
development that Jake Brukhman argues [https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital=
-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657] will make NFTs =E2=80=9Cthe bigges=
t asset class in blockchain.=E2=80=9D

Believe me when I say that we=E2=80=99re well on our way.

> The meme economy will become real.=20

- Meme creators will make NFTs
- Timestamps give proof-of-first
- Memegen partially goes on-chain
- Memetic spread is more traceable
- Memers become millionaires
- Risky art becomes uncensorable & monetizable
- Art moves outside regime control
