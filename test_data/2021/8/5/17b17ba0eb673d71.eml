h, <br /><br />When someone becomes a Lead (meaning they show up in your=
 Lead Catcher) all follow up and on click messages you have set up in yo=
ur campaign will stop getting sent to them.  Even if you mark those lead=
s as won or lost, the follow up messages will stop getting sent to them.=
 <br /><br />If you have drip messages set up in a campaign sequence, yo=
u would see those continue to send to a prospect even after they become=
 a lead. <br /><br />You can read more about the different types of camp=
aign messages here: <a href=3D"https://docs.mailshake.com/article/122-ki=
nds-of-campaign-messages">What kinds of campaign messages are there?</a>=
<br /><br />If there is a specific prospects you could share with me tha=
t you've seen get a follow up message after they become a lead I'd be ha=
ppy to take a look at that. <br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br />Anna<=

ot seeing any leads in your current #12 campaign but it looks like you h=
ave it set up to mark them as a lead when they reply. Once they become a=
 lead, that will stop any follow up or on click messages from getting se=
