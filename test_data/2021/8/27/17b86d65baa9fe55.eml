It's been a year of these Personal Advisory Board updates! If you'd like
off the bus please just let me know. I'm hugely appreciative of your time
and attention and don't want to waste either.

Otherwise, please know that thinking of what I'd ask you every other week
has been transformational in how I construct my theories, formulate my
questions, and spend my time. I can think of very few things that have
contributed more to my success over the last twelve months. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Josh
