*TL;DR: We're testing the plausibility of Indigometrics being a service
provider to reseller L&D firms, large consultancies, and/or asset
management firms. How can we best target growth aiming at a high-valuation
M&A exit?*

Summer is finally coming to a close, and I one couldn't be happier. I'm
getting really tired of "we're very interested, but let me schedule for
later when the right people are available" emails.

Overall things are going well; the Built for Change podcast is currently #8
on Apple's top Management podcasts list and looks likely to commission more
work (perhaps some video) soon. Indigometrics has spent the summer
bolstering our back end and building useful infrastructure so we are primed
for growth.

At present we've decided to leave off fundraising until we have better
numbers to improve valuation, which is a relief - we're profitable so don't
strictly need the money, and I'm keen to prove/disprove our core posits
around partnering with L&D firms, large consultancies, and/or asset
management firms. We're in discussion with most of the big ones in each of
those categories (but if you have introductions we're always grateful!)

The big question now is how to best accelerate growth as we go into the
fall. We will be submitting an HBR article about our biggest client's D&I
efforts soon, so will be able to test marketing impact. Hopefully as things
speed up out of summer the above partnerships will bear fruit. I'm also
pursuing direct sales opportunities with some large multinationals.

What am I missing, and what else should I be preparing for as we target
growth aiming at a high-valuation M&A exit?

I hope you and yours are doing well,
Josh
