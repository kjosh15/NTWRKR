AMAZING!!! Super stoked to watch the full thing, and stoked to hear
everything is picking up again.

Hey, your training all those years ago made a huge impact - I'm subsidizing
building a startup <http://indigometrics.com> by co-hosting the
NYTimes/Accenture's new business podcast (#8 in Management on Apple!), and
it's likely to lead to some video work as well. It's not as sexy as sci-fi
(or any of the other awesome work you do) but it lets me work with my
family from a remote farm in Iceland and talk about a topic I'm interested
in, so no complaints. Thanks for getting me started!!

All best wishes,
Josh
