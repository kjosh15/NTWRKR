We build SaaS software for social services. This year, we started achieving
product market fit and will look at about $6M in losses on $2.4M in
bookings, swinging to profitability in 2023. No debt to speak of and about
$2M in the bank.

Lots of IP developed and a nice double digit growth in a market where we
are quickly emerging as the disruptor. High interest from growth equity
funds but I'm not ready to sell yet so we're looking to raise $10-15M for
growth.

I can send you a deck if you want to know more.
