Josh, that=E2=80=99s great! I=E2=80=99m honored that I was able to play ANY p=
art in your journey.

And I=E2=80=99m SO jealous. We=E2=80=99ve visited Iceland and want to go bac=
k as soon as we feel traveling is safe again. In the meantime, we troll site=
s that dangle ridiculously cheap farmhouses in Norway and Sweden=E2=80=A6

Congrats on everything, and I sincerely hope we cross paths again,

Yuri
