We met at Bankinter's FTF a few years back; at one point I asked you about
business school. I'm currently growing a SaaS platform collecting some very
interest behavioral data inside large multinationals. I'd be curious what
you make of it if you're interested in a call. If so, let me know if any
times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or suggest something
that works for you GMT!

All best,
Josh
