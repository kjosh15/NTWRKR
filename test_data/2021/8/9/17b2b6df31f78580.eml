All best,
Josh

projects; let me know if any strike your interest, or just hit me with an =
update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

Current Projects:
=20
IndigoMetrics(http://www.=
indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); a data analytics platform =
for autonomously measuring and managing employee behavior. If your =
distributed workforce is starting to fray or you're looking for a data-led =
D&I solution, this is the answer. =20
Continuous Glucose Monitor =
Testing(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asB=
vSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project to understand how to use physically embedded =
sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and =
diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Innovation Consulting(http://www.josh.is): =
as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology =
strategy and new innovation / product development. We've seen some radical =
changes in the last year - the winners are acting on it!
