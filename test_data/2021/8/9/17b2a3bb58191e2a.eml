Sweets,

Here's what I thought we should cover in a Family meeting about what this
fall will actually look like!


   - Hulda working now! Everyone needs to help out more.
   - Sweepy for household work
   - Rooster for allowance (regardless of chores)
   - Fliphone for Othinn for safety
   - Personal phones for O and H! (to use at home)
      - We decide what's on it
      - They decide when they want to use it! (20m of games/day - otherwise
      to manage Sweepy, etc.)


Am I missing anything?

xoxo,
Josh
