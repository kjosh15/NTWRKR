Oh, and I forgot to say try the Reddit Recommended Routine as a circuit; no
rest except between each of the three sets, and then no more than two
minutes. Total puking territory!

That said, on consideration it's mostly because I went through each
progression and found where / what variation was really challenging - at
one point I was doing 25 chin-ups as a set, for example, but now that I'm
doing pull-ups I'm tapping out at 12. YMMV... Let me know if you try it!
