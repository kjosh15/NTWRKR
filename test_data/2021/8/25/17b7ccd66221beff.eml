Elyse,

Thanks so much for the call yesterday; it was very helpful to catch up and
compare notes on what you're hearing from members. Some followups:


   1. I've attached the links I mentioned under my sig, below.

   2. Of the topics you mentioned hearing lots about (specifically CVC,
   China, ESG, and Culture) I've some specific experience in each that may =
be
   helpful:

   - CVC: mostly in vetting tech, identifying multiplier opportunities by
      leveraging corporate assets and emerging tech, and in providing
      introductions (I've worked with most of the big VC firms/accelerators=
 in
      NYC and CA).

      - China: most of my experience here has been through the US
      Intelligence Community and individual investors in Beijing, Shanghai =
and
      Shenzhen. Happy to provide any introductions I can!

      - ESG: My metricing company, Indigometrics, is targeting Social data
      for ESG and is in conversations with some of the larger
investment firms in
      the US and EU, so obvs. happy to share my experience there.
Otherwise most
      of my experience is in identifying ways to use underutilized metrics =
to
      create better combined results for Environmental and Governance measu=
res.

      - Culture: As above, a big chunk of my day-to-day is in helping large
      multinationals create transformation using data.

      3. Can you tell me a little more about what you look for in terms of
   potential members? I'll be presenting with Google's Head of Privacy at a
   National Association of Corporate Directors meeting, for example, as wel=
l
   as discussing Cyber and Crypto at a conference for SEIC's clients, both =
of
   which might have potential members in the audience.

   4. Been noodling on your book club query. Do you know of anyone doing a
   book club format for the summary services out there? Blinkist, Lucid,
   Shortform, etc. all offer 3-5m summaries of the biggest business books. =
I'm
   curious if members would find the ensuing conversation and real-world
   comparison of notes based on them to be useful. I.e., shift the focus fr=
om
   the book to its relevance, all in a very quick turnaround package.


Let me know if the above is helpful. I'm throwing a bunch of things at you
here in the hopes that you can help me identify how best to be useful going
forward, so do let me know what you can use.

All best,
Josh
