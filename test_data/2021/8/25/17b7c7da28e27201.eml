Ginny,

I watched your World 50 discussion the other day with great interest; in
it, you said a number of things that felt really aligned with the work I'm
doing with peer-to-peer reviews and algorithmic modeling of behavior,
especially around equity and inclusion issues (here
<http://indigometrics.com>). We are refocusing leadership assessment,
attempting to shift competencies, and especially to raise consciousness in
employees as the next frontier of talent - all areas you mentioned
specifically. I'd be curious to continue the conversation in more depth if
you're interested!

Sincerely,
Josh
