Maybe I'm not understanding what a lead is - my experience has been that
when someone lands in my Lead Catcher and I mark them as "Won" or "Lost"
they continue to get followup emails unless I unsubscribe them (which
obviously messes with my records of who to contact in future campaigns.) Am
I right that this shouldn't happen?

Thanks!
Josh
