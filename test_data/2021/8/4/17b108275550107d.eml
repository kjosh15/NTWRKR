Loreley,

Wanted to check in on some projects we've recently discussed so I can help
move things forward if/where possible.

- Sales/Closing docs. This was feedback on the Estee/Motorola pitch
documentation, which included integration information as well as pricing.
Any feedback on what a *real* onboarding pack - and sales pack - ought to
include would be much appreciated; we can then jointly customize it for our
next customer.

- Onboarding docs. You've been working on these separately; can you invite
me to what you've made so I can get a better idea of what I'm talking to
for potential clients?

- D&I sales targets. This is pending the HBR article being approved. I'm
including this here as a quick heads-up that if it IS approved we'll want
to move quickly thereafter. :)

- LinkedIn company page. You'd mentioned this before, and I'm only just now
realizing that I'm not going to get to it anytime soon. Is this something
you can take on, and if so how can we support?

All best,
Josh
