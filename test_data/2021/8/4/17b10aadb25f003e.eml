I recently came across an interesting hyperlocal media project - I recall
we discussed this at one point so I figured I'd pass the pitch along to
you. Let me know if I'm remembering wrong!

A TV filmmaker friend in Canada has noticed that particularly rural areas
have very high levels of citizen engagement, and almost no media
representation. He's building a plan to use gov't funding (of which there
is a fair amount) to pay local reporters to cover hyperlocal issues.

The problem he's solving is that a) there's no data on what people actually
want and/or consume in terms of local media, and b) reporters need a way to
identify issues to report on.

To solve this, he's looking to set up a Raspberry Pi to enable rural
citizens to press a button and submit local issues, which he'll then chase
down and report on via streaming platforms. If the model works in his pilot
he can replicate the hardware, software, and legal structure and scale it
up using online-verified meritocracy for reporter selection. He'll also
generate a ton of interesting hyperlocal data about who is
suggesting/consuming what topics.

He needs help with the hardware and software, and eventually will need
access to VCs. If you're interested (or know someone who is) feel free to
contact him directly at chad@chadingraham.com.

Again, let me know if this is/isn't interesting to you - I don't want to
spam shit at you that wastes your time, but this one struck a chord based
on our past conversations!

All best,
Josh
