Hi Josh,

Thanks for your questions regarding the happiness course I took.  Aside from=
 giving you some info I rediscovered some things I wanted to work on.  If yo=
u=E2=80=99re interested there are also some TED talk references I can give y=
ou. =20

So, you should be happy to know one of your ideas is repeated in this course=
, that is:
Invest in experiences not stuff.

Another idea, write in a diary 5 positive things that occur in your life dai=
ly.

And, in regard to the wishes-wants you have in your life,
1.  Put in 3 to 4 words your wish, prominently displayed where you are remin=
ded of it.
2. Imagine the best outcome of your wish - what stops you from you from achi=
eving it.
3. Imagine the obstacle and how to overcome it.

I was surprised and encouraged by the division of things that effect our hap=
piness.
50% genetic
40% actions under our control
10% life circumstances

Hope you find this interesting and hopefully helpful.

Love you kiddo!

Mom
