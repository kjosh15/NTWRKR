Is this <https://savology.com/> or this <https://www.truebill.com/> worth
trying? I love the idea of having a PLAN for saving, and it might be worth
going through this together before you start school to get us both on the
same page going forward, esp. as I start drawing a salary from Indigo! Any
thoughts?

xoxo,
Josh
