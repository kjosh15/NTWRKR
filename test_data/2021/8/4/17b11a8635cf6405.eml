   about how Twitter lets agitators overcome their superiors within
   hierarchical organizations

I plan to compile all of these into one mega-post, and tie it all together
with some overarching thoughts. But first, I wanted to repost my first and
most well-read post about Twitter

from my old blog back in 2017. =E2=80=9CThe Shouting Class=E2=80=9D lays ou=
t what I think
of as the basic dynamic of the platform =E2=80=94 the fact that it preferen=
tially
gives social influence and attention to anyone with both the inclination to
denounce and decry things and the time to sit around yelling online. I
believe all or most of Twitter=E2=80=99s other issues stem from this one
fundamental problem. Anyway, here=E2=80=99s the post.

praising
the two men who died defending Muslim women on a train. I pointed out that
one of the heroes was a Republican army vet, while the other was a liberal
hippie type. I lamented that our current national political discourse so
often sets decent guys like this against each other, and wished that
liberals and conservatives could put aside their mutual suspicions and
unite at the political level to defend the country against white
supremacism, fascism, and the general madness brought on by the age of
Trump. This thread was very well-received, getting about 2000 retweets,
3300 likes, and numerous mostly favorable quote-tweets.

Nevertheless, there were some who were dissatisfied with the thread. A few
dozen people on the left wrote to complain that I was engaging in
"both-sides-ism", i.e. putting too little of the blame for the country's
woes on the average Republican voter. Some accused me of being an apologist
for racism and fascism. A smaller number of responders were alt-right types
wrote that the stabber had been a leftist, not a rightist. Some of these
responses reached 100 likes.

Seeing this, a thought suddenly occurred to me: the ratio of people who
expressed support for the thread to those who expressed annoyance with it
was over 20 to 1. But if you scrolled down the thread, the ratio of
*words* devoted
to support vs. words devoted to annoyance would be more like 1 to 100. Or
pixels, or square centimeters of screen space, or whatever. In other words,
the "annoyed" group, though far far smaller than the "supportive" group,
grabbed a vastly larger amount of attention.

And this in turn got me thinking: All of social media is like that. Not for
the first time, I started to worry that social media technology is hurting
our popular discourse and our national politics. But for the first time, I
could connect my worry to an identifiable and plausible phenomenon with
well-known causes.

I call it the Shouting Class.


*Who are the Shouting Class?*

Everyone has problems with something in society. And everyone sometimes
complains about those problems, which Albert Hirschman called "voice"
<https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkLtuxCAQRb9mKS2eBgqKKEqq1GnR2Ix3yXrBA=

But for many people, voice is contingent - as soon as the problems are
satisfactorily resolved they stop complaining and go back to living their
daily lives. But a subset of people will never stop complaining. When a
problem becomes less severe, they switch to a different problem. And they
will always find some problem that they feel requires their vocal
complaint. That subset - the people who will never stop complaining and
giving negative feedback - are the Shouting Class. (Of course, this isn't
really a binary distinction; there are shades of gray, as always.)

There are several reasons people may be part of the Shouting Class:

Reason 1: Idealism. Some people feel an emotional need to feel like they're
improving the world. Since the world is never perfect, and fighting for a
better world is intrinsic to these people's motivation (and probably their
identity), they will always continue to speak up. Notice that there are
many, many idealists who are not part of the Shouting Class - some express
their idealism by building homes for the poor, or volunteering at an animal
shelter, or working as a civil rights lawyer, or being a politician.
Shouting Class idealists are only those idealists who see shouting as a key
way to bring about positive change.

Reason 2: Personal Unhappiness. Research shows

that
negative moods make people much more likely to engage in online trolling.
We also have good reason to believe that some people are just generally
unhappy people - though life events make them relatively happier or sadder,
their baseline is a negative emotional state that changes only very slowly.
In other words, some people join the Shouting Class because they are giving
vent to the negative emotion that they are constantly experiencing for
reasons mostly unrelated to the problems they're complaining about.

Reason 3: Sadism. Research shows

that
many trolls are sadists, who delight in making other people feel
uncomfortable. Since recipients of complaints and negative feedback often
feel uncomfortable, joining the Shouting Class can be a way of indulging
sadism

Reason 4: Argumentativeness. Arguing is an intellectual activity, and many
people enjoy intellectual activity. Some people enjoy argument specifically

while others just use it as a break from other kinds of intellectual
activities (writing code, etc.). A subset of these people are
"mansplainers" who just want to show off how clever they are or listen to
themselves talk.

This is probably not an exhaustive list; I'm sure you can think of others.
But it's pretty clear, from research and from personal experience, that
there are a few people in society who fall under one or more of these
categories.


*Shouting Class case study: Me*

I'm obviously part of the Shouting Class. I write a blog in which I often
complain about stuff, and I have a Twitter account where I often complain
about stuff. So some of my characterization of the Shouting Class is just
introspection, coupled with the realization that there are other people out
there who are like me in various ways.

So it's no coincidence that all of the above motivations for Shouting have
applied to me at one time or another. I'm a fairly idealistic person. Like
everyone, I was pretty unhappy in grad school, which I think had a lot to
do with why I started blogging and tweeting. As a teenager, I delighted in
flustering people in anonymous internet forums. And many people tell me
that I am an argumentative guy. :-)

Although I feel a lot less of a desire to complain, criticize, and confront
people online than I used to - I am not as much of a Shouter as before - I
doubt this desire will ever completely go away. But when I look at my
friends and family, very few are like me in this regard. They occasionally
vent about their problems to people they know, but going on social media
and giving people a hard time about things just isn't something they do.


*Social media reduces the costs of joining the Shouting Class*

Above I listed some of the possible reasons to join the Shouting Class -
i.e., the benefits. But there are also costs. Time and effort are one cost.
Reputation risk is another - if everyone knows you as a complainer, you may
have fewer friends, build fewer useful business connections, or find
yourself signing divorce papers. Also, trolling people in real life can
lead to getting punched in the face.

Social media changes all this. First, there is no risk of getting punched
in the face (though you may get doxxed

Posting on social media takes almost no time or effort. And with
pseudonymity

there are no reputational consequences.

Twitter is obviously much more extreme than Facebook in these regards. It's
a lot easier to be pseudonymous. Posts can get shared much more quickly.
And you can talk to anyone you like, unless they block you. More
importantly, you can talk to *the followers* of anyone you like - if I'm
the first to reply to a Donald Trump tweet, most of the people who click on
that tweet will see my reply as well. That's massive exposure.

So Twitter, especially, gives instant safe mass exposure to anyone who
wants to complain about anything. In practice, this gives an enormous
bullhorn to the Shouting Class, because they are defined as *the people who
want to use the bullhorn*.

Consider life before social media. If you wanted to complain about
something, you could do it in person, but you'd suffer reputational and
other risks. You could write a letter to the editor, but it was subject to
editorial filtering, and you could only get letters published occasionally.
Same with calling in to radio shows. You could start your own media outlet
and pass it around, but dominance of large newspapers, radio shows, and TV
stations limited the circulation you could achieve. Even in the early age
of the internet, shouting was a lot harder than it is now. You could make a
website, but because of the lack of social sharing, it would be relatively
hard to gain a large audience. Forums were highly fragmented and also
lacked the sharing option.

In other words, shouting just wasn't nearly as easy in 1987 or even 2007 as
it is in 2017. Social media, especially Twitter, has changed the game
entirely.


*The Shouting Class looks larger than it really is*

It's important to realize that the Shouting Class isn't really that large.
Most of the people out there in the world are *not *the kind of people you
see commenting on your tweets or posting in your Facebook politics group.

In August of 2016, NPR disabled comments on their website, after finding
the following

I did find the numbers quite startling. In July, NPR.org recorded nearly 33
million unique users, and 491,000 comments. But those comments came from
just 19,400 commenters, Montgomery said. That's 0.06 percent of users who
are commenting, a number that has stayed steady through 2016.

When NPR analyzed the number of people who left at least one comment in
both June and July, the numbers showed an even more interesting pattern:
Just 4,300 users posted about 145 comments apiece, or 67 percent of all
NPR.org comments for the two months. More than half of all comments in May,
June and July combined came from a mere 2,600 users. The conclusion: NPR's
commenting system =E2=80=94 which gets more expensive the more comments tha=
t are
posted, and in some months has cost NPR twice what was budgeted =E2=80=94 i=
s
serving a very, very small slice of its overall audience.

This is why people say "Don't read the comments

- they recognize that blog comments are the domain of the Shouting Class.
But social media, and especially Twitter, is like one giant comments
section.

Twitter, especially, acts as an incredible force multiplier for the
Shouting Class. A study by the Anti-Defamation League found that two out of
three anti-semitic tweets sent in 2015 were sent by just 1600 accounts

of course, just makes the bullhorn even bigger.

My own Portland thread shows that even on Twitter, whose users are probably
far more likely than the average American to belong to the Shouting Class,
the ratio of quiet approvers to vocal complainers was something like 20 to
1. That's not as lopsided as the ratios for NPR comments, but it's striking=
.

In other words, the Shouting Class is a tiny minority of society that
dominates much of our political discourse, thanks in part to the bullhorn
created by the technology of social media.


*The potential benefits of the Shouting Class*

It would be unfair to paint the Shouting Class as a purely negative
phenomenon. Many of the Shouters are not Twitter Nazis or compulsive
mansplainers or pissed-off PhD students. Many are simply idealists who are
sincerely trying to change the world for the better.

And sometimes that works. "Voice", to use Hirschman's terminology, is
sometimes effective. For example, the marriage equality movement
<https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUUuSpSAQPM1jp8FXZMGiN30NgwelMqNgA74Ob=

was
quite effective in changing people's minds about gay marriage. That
movement didn't rely very much on direct action, threats of violence, civil
disobedience, foreign political pressure, etc. Instead, it was basically
just a bunch of people speaking up. And in my opinion, they changed the
world for the better in a significant way.

Now, it's important to realize that most of the people in the marriage
equality movement were not, themselves, part of the Shouting Class. They
were speaking up because of a specific problem, and once that problem was
solved, their use of "voice" diminished. In other words, they could be
satisfied.

But the members of the Shouting Class who joined that movement brought a
lot of important resources to the table. They brought experience (which of
course they had plenty of), energy, solidarity, time and money. Without
them, it might have been much harder to win the marriage equality fight.

I'm sure if you look throughout history you'll see plenty of movements like
this, where the Shouting Class served as the vanguard and the shock troops
for a larger group of temporary activists. Without the idealistic Shouters
always looking for new problems to be upset about, social progress might
grind to a halt, and deep injustices or inefficiencies remain undiscovered
for decades or even centuries.

Or it might not. Of course it's hard to know, since there's always a
Shouting Class, so we don't really know what the world would be like
without them. After social media has been around for a while, it'll be
possible for political scientists to find natural experiments to tell
whether its amplifying effect sped up social progress or not. But until
then, I'd say we have to at least acknowledge the distinct *possibility* th=
at
a subset of the Shouting Class often does good for the world.


*The Shouting Class and excess negativity*

But now I'd like to talk about some of the costs of the Shouting Class and
the bullhorn social media has given them. The most obvious cost is just
negativity. People like it when other people agree with them and say nice
things to them, and they dislike it when people disagree with them and say
mean things to them. That's so obvious that I'm not even going to bother
looking up research to confirm it!

So now consider how the Shouting Class creates an asymmetry here. Suppose I
say something on social media that 100 people agree with and 50 people
disagree with. If everyone gave me explicit feedback, I'd get 100 zaps of
positive emotion and 50 zaps of negative emotion. And assuming (for the
sake of simplicity) that those zaps are of the same intensity, I'll come
away feeling happy on balance.

But the 100 agree-ers are much less likely to be part of the Shouting Class
than the 50 disagree-ers, because the Shouting Class goes around
disagreeing with stuff. So the agree-ers will simply click the "like" or
"favorite" button, while the disagree-ers will write an explicit response
to explain why they disagree. The way social media is set up means that the
number of likes or favorites is just a number, which I can click on to show
a face or profile. But all the disagreeing responses will be full,
written-out things. The negative emotional zap I get from each of those
certainly outweighs the positive zap I get from my favorite count going one
higher.

So I end up walking away feeling bad, because I got 50 very powerful
negative zaps from the Shouting Class, and 100 very weak zaps from the
majority who agreed with me.

Oh, but it gets much much worse. Instead of thinking of just my one post,
let's think about 1000 people, each with their own post. It's here that we
see the massive emotional destructive power of the Shouting Class.

The Shouting Class is always going around looking for something to shout
at. This could mean they're likely to either follow more accounts, or read
more posts, or both. If that's the case, then their negative emotional
impact is multiplied even further. Imagine each of the 1000 people writes
one post, each of which gets a like or favorite from 100 people, each of
whom only reads *that one post*. But imagine there are 50 Shouters who go
around reading all 1000 posts, and leaving a disparaging comment with each
one.

In this extreme example, the positive emotional feedback of 100,000
positive people is vastly outweighed by the negative emotional feedback of
just 50 people!

Now, that's an extreme example. But it shows how the greater energy, zeal,
and time commitment of the Shouting Class, combined with the bullhorn of
social media, tips the balance of social media's emotional effect
dramatically toward the negative.

Much research has been done on the negative impact of Facebook

on
mood and mental health. Most of the explanations offered have involved
excessive forced social comparison and isolation from real-world
interaction. But I believe the impact of excessively negative discussions
could also be a reason for the effect, and I suspect that it's much worse
for Twitter.


*The Shouting Class and excessive social censure*

If your social group is small - a handful of friends, a social club, etc. -
there's a good chance that everyone in it will like you. And there's a good
chance that if you only mildly annoy someone, the chance that they will
complain openly to the group is low, because of the costs involved. They
might take you aside and say something privately, or say nothing, but
they'll only take it to the whole group if you've very egregiously offended
the.

But as your social group increases in size, the number of people who might
be annoyed, offended, or upset by any given thing you do goes up. With a
group of 5, there's a high probability that any given thing you do or say
will be inoffensive to all involved. With a group of 500, the probability
of you being offensive to someone is far larger, since A) 500 is a lot more
than 5, and B) the 500 is going to be a less carefully selected set than
the 5.

In particular, with 500 people rather than 5, your social group is much
larger to include at least one member of the Shouting Class, who by his or
her nature goes around looking for things to complain about, argue with, or
be offended by.

Social media expands social groups enormously. That has, pretty
predictably, resulted in the development of what young people refer to as
"callout culture." Conor Friedersdorf has some good interviews

with
college students, where they discuss the stress and social isolation of
knowing that you're always vulnerable to being "called out" by a member of
the Shouting Class. Some excerpts from his article:

Today, so many people are declaring so many things problematic on college
campuses that the next controversy is almost impossible to predict; it is
increasingly common to have done something without any fear of giving
offense (say, urging a sushi night in the dining hall) only to subsequently
read that the thing you=E2=80=99re on record having done is the object of a=
 huge
controversy elsewhere. Does the faraway story portend a future where you=E2=
=80=99ll
be the one in the hot seat?

No wonder so many students are stressed out by this. And the risk-averse
have it especially hard. =E2=80=9CI probably hold back 90 percent of the th=
ings
that I want to say due to fear of being called out,=E2=80=9D another studen=
t wrote.
=E2=80=9CPeople won=E2=80=99t call you out because your opinion is wrong. P=
eople will call
you out for literally anything. On Twitter today I came across someone
making fun a girl who made a video talking about how much she loved God and
how she was praying for everyone. There were hundreds of comments, rude
comments, below the video. It was to the point that they weren=E2=80=99t ev=
en
making fun of what she was standing for. They were picking apart
everything. Her eyebrows, the way her mouth moves, her voice, the way her
hair was parted. Ridiculous. I am not the kind of person to be able to
brush off insults like that. Hence why I avoid any situation that could put
me in that position. And that=E2=80=99s sad.=E2=80=9D

This seems like much more of a Facebook problem than a Twitter one, given
that Facebook represents offline social ties far more. It's never happened
to me, but I went to college before the Facebook age (yes, I'm that old).
But I know a lot of people seven or ten or fifteen years younger than me
who all loudly bemoan "callout culture" in very similar terms to what
Friedersdorf's article describes. Even though some of them engage in it
themselves.

I should note that something like this *can* happen on Twitter too. On
Twitter, people tend to form groups not by real-life friendships, but by
political affiliation. I'm a generally left-leaning kind of guy, so my
followers tend to be left-leaning folks as well. So when I write something
that seems vaguely nice, conciliatory, or even non-condemnatory about any
Republicans, it's highly likely I'll be "called out" by left-leaning people
elsewhere in the Twitterverse. On Twitter, as in the Facebook-real life
nexus, many people respond to this ever-present threat by staying silent;
others, by trying to hunt down and shame anyone who calls them out.
Fortunately for me, I don't much mind, but I think most people mind more
than I do.

Anyway, for centuries, humans have tended to have small, strongly tied
inner social circles and larger, more weakly tied outer circles. We tend to
respond strongly to any vocal criticism within the inner circle. But social
media has thrown this concentric pattern of social circles into disarray,
by making the inner circle just as "strong" as the outer one in some ways.
So criticism from someone in the outer circle now often carries the social
weight and destructive power that only the inner circle should really have.
The Shouting Class have thus gained inordinate power over who gets liked
and who gets ostracized, and much of the result seems negative so far. I'd
like to see a lot more formal research on this, however, before we draw
firm conclusions.

it makes you think that thing is common. That's a fallacy, of course; it's
a case of selection bias

It's easy to come up with hand-wavey evolutionary explanations for the
Availability Heuristic, most of which boil down to the old adage "where
there's smoke, there's fire." But research has found this bias again and
again. Here are some examples of how it applies to media exposure

:

After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the
likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a
person's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual
events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more
routine, less sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents.
For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of
death, people tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely because they
can more readily recall an example from memory. Moreover, unusual and vivid
events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported
in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common
diseases.

Now apply this heuristic to social media and the Shouting Class. If you see
a bunch of people arguing and shouting about stuff, and you *don't* see the
people who *aren't* arguing and shouting about stuff, you're probably going
to think that society is a lot more discordant and divided than it really
is.

To this, add the fact that the Shouting Class shouts at each other. In
fact, because the Shouting Class' appetite for shouting is infinite, they
will shout at each other infinitely if they encounter each other.

Before social media, it was difficult for members of the Shouting Class to
find each other. I remember walking by a protest in October of 2001 and
seeing pro-war and anti-war protesters shouting in each other's faces. I
was stunned at the intensity of the discord. Today, I wouldn't even bat an
eye. Social media, especially Twitter, immediately puts shouters from all
over the world in contact with each other. The shouting is continuous.

This fuels the perception that society is irrevocably and deeply divided.
Americans these days are saying that their society is more divided

than
ever before, and they have little optimism that the divide will be resolved
any time soon.

Of course, part of that is just because of American politics - partisanship

and
other trends have certainly contributed strongly to this feeling of
division, along with things like changing racial demographics and the
fallout from the Great Recession, 9/11, and Iraq.

But I bet that social media is exacerbating the effect. There was plenty of
partisanship, racism, anti-immigrant xenophobia, economic pain, fear of
terrorism, geographical sorting, etc. in 2012 and 2008 and even before, but
we never saw anything like the bitterness and anguish and hate of the 2016
election. And that bitterness, anguish and hate has not dissipated during
Trump's presidency, and it would not have dissipated during Clinton's if
she had won. There is something structural at work here, and I believe
social media is a part of it. Facebook's "fake news" problem gets by far
the most attention, but I wouldn't underrate the toxic impact of Twitter,
or the infinite, eternal battles of the Shouting Class on both platforms.
More than one writer referred to 2016 as the "Twitter Election," and I
think there's more than a grain of truth to that description.

The problem is not just that the Shouting Class creates the illusion that
the country is more deeply divided than it is, but that this illusion can
then become fact. Research shows that trolling is contagious
<https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxtkU1uxCAMhU8z7CbiN8CCRTe9RkTAk9ASiIBMl=

when people see other people complaining and fighting, they get the urge to
join. If society is irrevocably divided, even people who aren't members of
the Shouting Class feel the need to fight for their side, or risk being
overwhelmed by the enemy.

But 2016 won't be the last Twitter Election. Remember, because the Shouting
Class' appetite for shouting is insatiable, nothing that happens at the
wider political level will make them stop shouting. So there will always be
a baseline level of discord and anger visible to everyone on social media,
and there will always be the danger of that discord spreading like a
contagious disease.


*The Shouting Class and the exhaustion of sympathy*

Imagine that you are walking through a city and a hungry homeless person
comes up to you and asks for money to buy food. You might give him money
and walk away feeling good, imagining how now he won't go hungry. But now
imagine that you walk past a row of 100 hungry homeless people, and you
don't have nearly enough money to give all of them. Even if you now feed 5
hungry people instead of just 1, you'll probably walk away feeling bad,
knowing that there are more hungry people out there than you can help.

That's not a perfect analogy for the way the Shouting Class overloads our
empathy. Hunger and homelessness could be completely solved if we had the
social will to pony up the money. But the anguish of the Shouting Class is
a hole that will never be filled.

Most of the Shouting Class, with the exception of those who are just there
to mansplain, blow off steam, or have a good argument, express deep
dissatisfaction with society. But unlike those who join movements
temporarily in order to get concrete results, the Shouting Class'
disaffection is not something that can be fixed.

Idealistic Shouters will continue to find something to crusade for, but
their ideals will differ, so they can't all be appeased at once. Moving in
the direction of a liberal idealist's vision will not diminish his hunger
for further social change, even as it drives conservative idealists to rage
and despair.

Unhappy Shouters will continue to have problems with society because they
are displacing negative emotion that really doesn't come from society at
all. An angry, unhappy person can't be made happy by living in even the
most utopian of feasible societies. What they need is not utopia but a hug,
and possibly some therapy.

Sadistic Shouters don't actually want social change, but merely to give
people a hard time, troll them, or "trigger" them. Sometimes they do this
by pretending they have deep problems with society.

So no matter how much we change society, or in what direction, there will
be a baseline level of publicly expressed social disaffection that we can't
get below. With social media giving the Shouting Class a bullhorn, that
baseline level is far higher than

For those of us who feel sympathy for victims of social injustice, this can
be maddening. Most of us are basically good folks - when we see someone who
appears to be victimized by society, we want to help them. We want to
improve society, to make it better. We don't want to be part of a system
that hurts even one single person

.

So when nothing we accomplish can diminish the seeming anguish of the
Shouters, what are we to do? We can exert ourselves ever more mightily to
change society, but when we look at the past, and see that all our past
successes have failed to diminish the shouting, we are liable to fall into
despair and a feeling of powerlessness.

Which brings me to the final potential problem with the Shouting
Class...What if it forces us to become callous?


*The cost of immunity to the Shouting Class*

Ultimately, all of these problems - negativity, social censure, social
discord, and empathy exhaustion - can be dealt with by developing an
immunity to shouting. In other words, by becoming callous toward people's
expression of approbation, dissatisfaction, anguish, irritation, etc. In
fact, people on social media say this all the time: "Grow a thicker skin!"

But what are the costs of having a thick-skinned society? One potential
cost is that elites and social institutions become unresponsive to
legitimate calls for social change.

I saw this in action in college, with the protest community. At one point I
joined some protests demanding higher wages for Stanford custodial workers.
We marched, we yelled outside the president's office til he came out and
talked to us. They raised the workers' wages.

But after that victory, I was astonished to see the protest leaders sit
down and immediately start planning their next campaign. I asked them why
they didn't intend to reward the establishment for giving ground on the
wage issue. They just sort of gave me disparaging looks, except for one guy
who told me "Frankly, I go to protests to hook up with hot anarchist
chicks."

The Shouting Class is mostly not looking to hook up. But like those
protesters, social media's Shouting Class has adopted criticism, anger, and
disaffection as ways of life - not the means to an end, but the end in and
of itself. Eventually, just as Stanford's administrators mostly stopped
paying heed to the protest community, the powers that be will learn to
accept and ignore a very high baseline level of popular disaffection. And
that will raise the bar for movements whose needs are more urgent and
realistic and capable of being satisfied - it'll be hard to tell real
grievance from grievance-as-a-lifestyle.

(I sort of think suspect something like this happened with the Tea Party
and Obama. The theory is that when Democrats saw that nothing could
possibly appease the Republicans, they stopped paying attention to them at
all, which I think drove GOP voters to amp up the extremism to levels
previously unheard of, in the form of Trump.)

I worry that the costs of evolved callousness could go way beyond political
protest movements, though. When people shout "We are in pain!

Not a pretty picture, is it?

The Shouting Class, with the bullhorn of social media, is forcing us all to
grow thicker skins. But I don't want to live in a society of thick-skinned
people.


*Social media as a prison and the Shouting Class as the prison guards*

At this point, I think I've explained enough potential downsides of the
Shouting Class where it's time to start talking about potential solutions.
So far, I've portrayed the problem as a negative externality

caused
by the advent of social media technology. So why not just quit social media=
?

The answer is: Strong network effects. The very thing that makes Facebook
so much profit, and would make Twitter so much profit if they could figure
out how to put advertisements in a Twitter feed, is also the thing that
makes these networks impossible to leave. You're on Facebook because your
friends are on Facebook, and they're on Facebook because you're on
Facebook. You're on Twitter because your colleagues, readers, customers,
voters, etc. are on Twitter, and they're on it because you're on it. In
other words, everyone is locked in because of the network effect.

To the extent that that network effect creates social value (and it does),
it's a positive network externality. But to the extent that everyone being
on social media creates net negative value due to the depredations of the
Shouting Class, then that network effect is a negative externality, and it
would be better

If, as studies suggest, social media has a deleterious overall effect on

*Why blame the technology? The Shouting Class and Revolutionary France*

It's important to note a couple of things here. First, social media may
have given the Shouting Class a bullhorn, but it didn't create the Shouting
Class; they have always been with us. Second, the Shouting Class has caused
enormous disasters before, even without social media. One fairly clear-cut
case is the French Revolution.

The French Revolution started well

the
former. It was informational anarchy.

The journalists, activists, firebrands, and organizers of France's century
of revolution were the Shouting Class of that day, and newspapers were
their Twitter. We think of the age of newspapers as one of cozy oligopoly,
with men in hats reading the Paper of Record over their breakfast. In fact,
that was only the end of the newspaper age; its beginning was chaos. And
France, a society primed for social division and discord, took the brunt of
that chaos.


*The Shouting Class and media industry concentration*

That history suggests that even without all the fancy sharing and matching
and instant-response technology of Twitter and Facebook, media
fragmentation can give a bullhorn to the Shouting Class. It hints that
there are cycles of media fragmentation and concentration, where new
information technologies create an explosion of independent producers that
gradually (or suddenly) gets crushed back into oligopoly.

Decentralization, of course, was the original idea. The people who built
social media were primarily techno-libertarian

They sought out to use the new technology of the internet to smash the
established oligopolies - broadcast news, cable news, major newspapers.
Evan Williams, one of Twitter's founders, created Blogger - the platform on

have
all publicly committed to the ideal of "free speech" - but unlike Thomas
Jefferson, they mean much more than simply having the government get its
hands off the press. They saw social media as a way of democratizing
information - of allowing everyone to be a part-time journalist and op-ed
writer.

Of course, the self-interested part of this vision was that the
slaughtering of ABC News and the New York Times would put billions of
dollars into the pockets of whoever owned the social media platforms. But
there was also a real idealism there. Many people were jubilant

over
social media's role in the Arab Spring. The little people, with their
tweets and blog posts and cell phone cameras, were overthrowing vile
dictators!

But fast-forward to 2017, and it doesn't really feel like the world's
dictators have been overthrown, does it? All the shouting that the Shouting
Class is doing on social media doesn't seem to have made America - or
almost anywhere, really - a more free place.

Maybe it just takes time. As Zhou Enlai apocryphally said

of
the French Revolution, it's too early to say. Nobody really knows how
technology affects society until well after the fact.

But I think we're now learning that the simple, decentralized information
utopia envisioned by social media's creators and early boosters is not
quite what we get. When Big Media's power was shattered, that power passed
to a wider group of people, but not all The People. It passed to the
Shouting Class.

So what do we do if we decide that rule by the Shouting Class is
suboptimal? The old titans of old media aren't coming back - we will see no
return to Edward R. Murrow, and the big newspapers will probably continue
to drift toward their future as niche publications.

But as I see it,* some* kind of concentration is needed. Informational
anarchy is always ruled by the Shouting Class, so the only way to curb the
Shouters' power is to end the anarchy. Maybe social media platforms
themselves will become the new quality filters

make their profiles more private, and learn to unfollow people who engage
in callout culture.

Or maybe everyone will just grow a really thick skin and we'll all just
sort of learn to ignore each other.

Or maybe I'm wrong, and the Shouting Class really isn't that big a problem,
and social media doesn't really make people that unhappy, and American or
world politics are just going through an inevitable turbulent phase, and
callout culture is vastly exaggerated, and I just spend way too much time
on Twitter.

e" target=3D"_blank">a Twitter thread</a>=C2=A0praising the two men who die=
d defending Muslim women on a train. I pointed out that one of the heroes w=
as a Republican army vet, while the other was a liberal hippie type. I lame=
nted that our current national political discourse so often sets decent guy=
s like this against each other, and wished that liberals and conservatives =
could put aside their mutual suspicions and unite at the political level to=
 defend the country against white supremacism, fascism, and the general mad=
ness brought on by the age of Trump. This thread was very well-received, ge=
tting about 2000 retweets, 3300 likes, and numerous mostly favorable quote-=
tweets.<br><br>Nevertheless, there were some who were dissatisfied with the=
 thread. A few dozen people on the left wrote to complain that I was engagi=
ng in &quot;both-sides-ism&quot;, i.e. putting too little of the blame for =
the country&#39;s woes on the average Republican voter. Some accused me of =
being an apologist for racism and fascism. A smaller number of responders w=
ere alt-right types wrote that the stabber had been a leftist, not a righti=
st. Some of these responses reached 100 likes.<br><br>Seeing this, a though=
t suddenly occurred to me: the ratio of people who expressed support for th=
e thread to those who expressed annoyance with it was over 20 to 1. But if =
you scrolled down the thread, the ratio of=C2=A0<em>words</em>=C2=A0devoted=
 to support vs. words devoted to annoyance would be more like 1 to 100. Or =
pixels, or square centimeters of screen space, or whatever. In other words,=
 the &quot;annoyed&quot; group, though far far smaller than the &quot;suppo=
rtive&quot; group, grabbed a vastly larger amount of attention.<br><br>And =
this in turn got me thinking: All of social media is like that. Not for the=
 first time, I started to worry that social media technology is hurting our=
 popular discourse and our national politics. But for the first time, I cou=
ld connect my worry to an identifiable and plausible phenomenon with well-k=
nown causes.<br><br>I call it the Shouting Class.<br><br><strong><br>Who ar=

rschman called &quot;voice&quot;</a>. But for many people, voice is conting=
ent - as soon as the problems are satisfactorily resolved they stop complai=
ning and go back to living their daily lives. But a subset of people will n=
ever stop complaining. When a problem becomes less severe, they switch to a=
 different problem. And they will always find some problem that they feel r=
equires their vocal complaint. That subset - the people who will never stop=
 complaining and giving negative feedback - are the Shouting Class. (Of cou=
rse, this isn&#39;t really a binary distinction; there are shades of gray, =
as always.)<br><br>There are several reasons people may be part of the Shou=
ting Class:<br><br>Reason 1: Idealism. Some people feel an emotional need t=
o feel like they&#39;re improving the world. Since the world is never perfe=
ct, and fighting for a better world is intrinsic to these people&#39;s moti=
vation (and probably their identity), they will always continue to speak up=
. Notice that there are many, many idealists who are not part of the Shouti=
ng Class - some express their idealism by building homes for the poor, or v=
olunteering at an animal shelter, or working as a civil rights lawyer, or b=
eing a politician. Shouting Class idealists are only those idealists who se=
e shouting as a key way to bring about positive change.<br><br>Reason 2: Pe=

9;m a fairly idealistic person. Like everyone, I was pretty unhappy in grad=
 school, which I think had a lot to do with why I started blogging and twee=

 forums. And many people tell me that I am an argumentative guy. :-)<br><br=

I doubt this desire will ever completely go away. But when I look at my fri=
ends and family, very few are like me in this regard. They occasionally ven=

get=3D"_blank">marriage equality movement</a>=C2=A0was quite effective in c=
hanging people&#39;s minds about gay marriage. That movement didn&#39;t rel=
y very much on direct action, threats of violence, civil disobedience, fore=
ign political pressure, etc. Instead, it was basically just a bunch of peop=
le speaking up. And in my opinion, they changed the world for the better in=
 a significant way.<br><br>Now, it&#39;s important to realize that most of =
the people in the marriage equality movement were not, themselves, part of =
the Shouting Class. They were speaking up because of a specific problem, an=
d once that problem was solved, their use of &quot;voice&quot; diminished. =
In other words, they could be satisfied.<br><br>But the members of the Shou=
ting Class who joined that movement brought a lot of important resources to=
 the table. They brought experience (which of course they had plenty of), e=
nergy, solidarity, time and money. Without them, it might have been much ha=
rder to win the marriage equality fight.<br><br>I&#39;m sure if you look th=
roughout history you&#39;ll see plenty of movements like this, where the Sh=
outing Class served as the vanguard and the shock troops for a larger group=
 of temporary activists. Without the idealistic Shouters always looking for=
 new problems to be upset about, social progress might grind to a halt, and=
 deep injustices or inefficiencies remain undiscovered for decades or even =
centuries.<br><br>Or it might not. Of course it&#39;s hard to know, since t=
here&#39;s always a Shouting Class, so we don&#39;t really know what the wo=
rld would be like without them. After social media has been around for a wh=
ile, it&#39;ll be possible for political scientists to find natural experim=
ents to tell whether its amplifying effect sped up social progress or not. =
But until then, I&#39;d say we have to at least acknowledge the distinct=C2=
=A0<em>possibility</em>=C2=A0that a subset of the Shouting Class often does=
 good for the world.<br><br><br><strong>The Shouting Class and excess negat=
ivity</strong><br><br>But now I&#39;d like to talk about some of the costs =
of the Shouting Class and the bullhorn social media has given them. The mos=
t obvious cost is just negativity. People like it when other people agree w=
ith them and say nice things to them, and they dislike it when people disag=
ree with them and say mean things to them. That&#39;s so obvious that I&#39=
;m not even going to bother looking up research to confirm it!<br><br>So no=
w consider how the Shouting Class creates an asymmetry here. Suppose I say =
something on social media that 100 people agree with and 50 people disagree=
 with. If everyone gave me explicit feedback, I&#39;d get 100 zaps of posit=
ive emotion and 50 zaps of negative emotion. And assuming (for the sake of =
simplicity) that those zaps are of the same intensity, I&#39;ll come away f=
eeling happy on balance.<br><br>But the 100 agree-ers are much less likely =
to be part of the Shouting Class than the 50 disagree-ers, because the Shou=
ting Class goes around disagreeing with stuff. So the agree-ers will simply=
 click the &quot;like&quot; or &quot;favorite&quot; button, while the disag=
ree-ers will write an explicit response to explain why they disagree. The w=
ay social media is set up means that the number of likes or favorites is ju=
st a number, which I can click on to show a face or profile. But all the di=
sagreeing responses will be full, written-out things. The negative emotiona=
l zap I get from each of those certainly outweighs the positive zap I get f=
rom my favorite count going one higher.<br><br>So I end up walking away fee=
ling bad, because I got 50 very powerful negative zaps from the Shouting Cl=
ass, and 100 very weak zaps from the majority who agreed with me.<br><br>Oh=
, but it gets much much worse. Instead of thinking of just my one post, let=
&#39;s think about 1000 people, each with their own post. It&#39;s here tha=
t we see the massive emotional destructive power of the Shouting Class.<br>=
<br>The Shouting Class is always going around looking for something to shou=
t at. This could mean they&#39;re likely to either follow more accounts, or=
 read more posts, or both. If that&#39;s the case, then their negative emot=
ional impact is multiplied even further. Imagine each of the 1000 people wr=
ites one post, each of which gets a like or favorite from 100 people, each =
of whom only reads=C2=A0<em>that one post</em>. But imagine there are 50 Sh=
outers who go around reading all 1000 posts, and leaving a disparaging comm=
ent with each one.<br><br>In this extreme example, the positive emotional f=
eedback of 100,000 positive people is vastly outweighed by the negative emo=
tional feedback of just 50 people!<br><br>Now, that&#39;s an extreme exampl=
e. But it shows how the greater energy, zeal, and time commitment of the Sh=
outing Class, combined with the bullhorn of social media, tips the balance =
of social media&#39;s emotional effect dramatically toward the negative.<br=

br><br><strong>The cost of immunity to the Shouting Class</strong><br><br>U=
ltimately, all of these problems - negativity, social censure, social disco=
rd, and empathy exhaustion - can be dealt with by developing an immunity to=
 shouting. In other words, by becoming callous toward people&#39;s expressi=
on of approbation, dissatisfaction, anguish, irritation, etc. In fact, peop=
le on social media say this all the time: &quot;Grow a thicker skin!&quot;<=
br><br>But what are the costs of having a thick-skinned society? One potent=
ial cost is that elites and social institutions become unresponsive to legi=
timate calls for social change.<br><br>I saw this in action in college, wit=
h the protest community. At one point I joined some protests demanding high=
er wages for Stanford custodial workers. We marched, we yelled outside the =
president&#39;s office til he came out and talked to us. They raised the wo=
rkers&#39; wages.<br><br>But after that victory, I was astonished to see th=
e protest leaders sit down and immediately start planning their next campai=
gn. I asked them why they didn&#39;t intend to reward the establishment for=
 giving ground on the wage issue. They just sort of gave me disparaging loo=
ks, except for one guy who told me &quot;Frankly, I go to protests to hook =
up with hot anarchist chicks.&quot;<br><br>The Shouting Class is mostly not=
 looking to hook up. But like those protesters, social media&#39;s Shouting=
 Class has adopted criticism, anger, and disaffection as ways of life - not=
 the means to an end, but the end in and of itself. Eventually, just as Sta=
nford&#39;s administrators mostly stopped paying heed to the protest commun=
ity, the powers that be will learn to accept and ignore a very high baselin=
e level of popular disaffection. And that will raise the bar for movements =
whose needs are more urgent and realistic and capable of being satisfied - =
it&#39;ll be hard to tell real grievance from grievance-as-a-lifestyle.<br>=
<br>(I sort of think suspect something like this happened with the Tea Part=
y and Obama. The theory is that when Democrats saw that nothing could possi=
bly appease the Republicans, they stopped paying attention to them at all, =
which I think drove GOP voters to amp up the extremism to levels previously=
 unheard of, in the form of Trump.)<br><br>I worry that the costs of evolve=
d callousness could go way beyond political protest movements, though. When=
 people shout &quot;<a href=3D"https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkd2OhCA=
