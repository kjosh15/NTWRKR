Not sure if you're the right person for this; if not can you point me in
the right direction?

As a result of the recent changes at Foundry Media, I would like to request
that my payments be bifurcated from here on out, with my share of advances,
royalties and any other payments from "You Are The Product" or "Reputation
Economics" sent directly to me. I would also like to request that my former
Foundry agent, Mollie Glick, and myself receive copies of all notices and
royalty reports that are sent to Foundry. Please cc me when you send these
notes.

Thanks!!
Joshua Klein
