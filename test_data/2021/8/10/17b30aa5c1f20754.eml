<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The Future of Data Intelligence<br>
<br>
Big data and analytics are changing how everything operates now more than e=
ver, from small-scale companies employing third-party solutions (like the p=
roject management software that obviated project managers) to massive multi=
nationals who are inheriting systemic
 algorithmic bias (such as Cambridge Analytica displayed), and from governm=
ents like China and the EU (who are legislating technology controls in very=
 different ways) to the U.S. (which - so far - is basically not legislating=
 technology controls at all.)<br>
<br>
Josh will provide concrete examples and strategic analysis to show the myri=
ad ways in which we&#39;re under-estimating the potential impact of the dat=
a we&#39;re collecting and how it might ultimately be used. Come learn abou=
t the inherent bias within the algos we&#39;re
 suddenly relying on (and how to adjust for it), easy ways data can be misu=
sed and how to avoid them, and - of course - the true shape of the ballooni=
ng security threat.
<br>
<br>
From surreptitious social controls in the workplace to 1984-style &quot;tho=
ught crime&quot; governance, our workforces have never had more data collec=
ted about them - nor ever had so much say in how that data should be used. =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=E2=80=9CIntelligence is the ability to adapt to cha=
nge.=E2=80=9D So said the English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and a=
uthor Stephen Hawking.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The conceptual definition refers to intelligence as =
the ability to learn from experience, recognize patterns, comprehend ideas,=
 solve problems, use our knowledge to adapt to new
 situations and use language to communicate. In research studies, intellige=
nce is whatever the intelligence test measures, which could vary by culture=
 and region.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Artificial intelligence and human intelligence delve=
 into cognitive functions such as memory, problem-solving, learning, planni=
ng, language, reasoning, and perception. AI is an
 innovation created by human intelligence and it is designed to do specific=
 tasks much faster with less effort. But with machine learning, the system =
itself has the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience w=
ithout being explicitly programmed.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">On the other hand, human intelligence is better at m=
ulti-tasking. It can incorporate emotional elements, human interaction, as =
well as self-awareness in the cognitive process.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Given how diverse an individual=E2=80=99s abilities =
are, it may not be justifiable to label all those abilities into a single w=
ord, intelligence. Perhaps these diverse abilities represent
 different kinds of intelligence.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Was Dustin Hoffman=E2=80=99s Rain Man character inte=
lligent? While he had significant mental disabilities, as a savant, he demo=
nstrated certain mathematical and memory abilities far in
 excess of average. What about Toulouse-Lautrec or Beethoven, both of whom =
suffered medical maladies and were deemed artistic geniuses, but were they =
intelligent? Some researchers have also concluded that plants exhibit the s=
imple forms of behavior that neuroscientists
 describe as basic intelligence.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At this, our 17th annual Executive Conference, we wi=
ll address a variety of ways intelligence can be defined, how it affects th=
e financial services ecosystem and society at large,
 as well as introduce the power of what humans can produce through persever=
ance, empathy and self-awareness.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As our experiences with Amazon, Google, AirBnB and o=
thers outside the wealth management ecosystem inform how we and our custome=
rs behave, we=E2=80=99ll introduce expert speakers from outside
 the industry to share their unique insights.=C2=A0 While there is no one b=

=80=9D physical attributes of other players, Brian=E2=80=99s work ethic, in=
tense passion, and unrelenting desire to never rest on his laurels enabled =
him to maximize his talents and perform at levels far exceeding
 team expectations. In this dynamic and uplifting presentation, you will se=

highly relevant to those in other
 industries. Following the presentation, Brian encourages any and all quest=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">What do people actually mean when they talk about =
=E2=80=9Cartificial intelligence=E2=80=9D or AI? There is a lack of clarity=
 around the definition of AI, which can frequently lead to confusion
 and, at times, disagreement. AI is about a set of capabilities that can en=
able a business to run in new ways. At the core of these capabilities are a=
 suite of technologies that enable adaptive predictive power by using propr=
ietary company and third party data.
 By linking this predictive power to business decisions, new behaviors, and=
 customer experience, companies can drive revenue growth, take out costs, a=
nd deliver other non-financial value metrics. How can banks, wealth manager=
s and asset managers harness the
 power of AI?<u></u><u></u></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">For the past several decades, we&#39;ve lived in a w=
orld in which full-time jobs and lifetime employment were the goal and norm=
. Few people thought twice about going to an office every
 day or working on a set schedule; this was simply how business was done. P=
arents&#39; advice to &quot;study hard, get good grades, go to college and =
you&#39;ll be guaranteed a good job&quot; often held true. An intelligent w=
orkplace reflected all of these things. And yet, today
 each of these assumptions is being systematically disrupted =E2=80=94 with=
 profound impacts on the future of talent and intelligence. From the rise o=
f freelancing, &quot;digital nomads&quot; and the gig economy to the rapid =
expansion of remote work or the unknowns of automation
 and AI, we see massive shifts in who, where and how people can work.<u></u=
><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">While these shifts are driven largely by technology,=
 they also reflect evolving priorities, values and cultures. Around the wor=
ld, individuals and organizations are rethinking how
 intelligence is organized, where it can be located, who can participate, w=
hat this means for professional development, education and public policy...=
 and, of course, how this affects investment. April will take us on a journ=
ey through this new work landscape,
 sharing insights and examples from her experiences in more than 100 countr=
ies and helping you understand what these changes mean for you, your portfo=
lio, your organization and your family.<u></u><u></u></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The fact that the world is changing is not new to an=
yone. The more important question is, what do we need to do in the face of =
change? As the pace of commoditization accelerates,
 client expectations shift, and technological disruption consistently chang=
es the playing field, we must transform ourselves and our teams at a faster=
 rate than the external environment is changing. Transformation starts with=
 leaders going first and embracing
 the critical role they play in aligning their teams behind a strategic vis=
ion to find opportunity in a rapidly changing, competitive environment.

 order to lead your clients and organizations to the
