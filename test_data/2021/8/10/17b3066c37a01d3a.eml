I know you must get stuff like this often (so until now I've avoided it!)
but this one feels like potentially of genuine interest. Let me know if I'm
wrong!

A good friend has built an anti-disinformation campaign to compete with the
viral disinformation of the far right. This is a toolset that's been
totally disregarded by the left, to our peril. More info is below, but he's
(surprise!) looking for funding. Do you know anyone who might be interested=
?

All best wishes,
Josh


Truth Not Lies creates compelling digital narratives to fight
disinformation. Its hyper-targeted content engages the millions of
Americans targeted for disinformation at scale with pro-democratic,
pro-fact, and pro-science memes and websites. Founded in 2020 by Jehmu
Greene and David Goldstein to respond to the proliferation of
disinformation in elections, the organization=E2=80=99s pilot project in
Pennsylvania produced outsized gains for progressives. Truth Not Lies is
now tackling vaccine hesitancy, the Big Lie, QAnon and climate denialism
through its 501c3 and 501c4 entities. Utilizing Moral Foundations Theory,
behavioral science, and neuroscientific research, Truth Not Lies=E2=80=99 w=
ork is a
highly cost-effective method of accomplishing persuasion with people
radicalized by the peddlers of disinformation. By creating powerful,
emotional and above all truthful narratives, showing up consistently across
digital media and relentlessly measuring, Truth Not Lies is giving the
truth a digital ally.
