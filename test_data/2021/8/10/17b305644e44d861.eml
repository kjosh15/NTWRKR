That's the one - for some reason my mind saw your iPad + keyboard as a
macbook air propped all the way open... That's what I'm after as I have a
bluetooth keyboard but want to use the screen on the macbook. I think I'm
going feral as my first inclination was to grab a block of wood and use a
chainsaw to cut a groove, but TBH I think that might be my best bet...

Thx for the tips!
