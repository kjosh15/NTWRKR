I hope you are doing well over this rather overwhelming stretch.

I know it's been over a month since I sent out what I intended to be a
twice-monthly email, and I'll try to do better. I was finishing my book
building on the "Survival of the Richest" articles (about the prepper
billionaires who plan to leave us all behind). It's an effort to
deconstruct the "mindset" leading to these beliefs and behaviors, and
explore how we may have internalized them ourselves. Fingers crossed my
editor likes it.

I've also been working hard. I'm developing my novel *Ecstasy Club* and
graphic novel *A.D.D.* into screen projects, discussing the changing shape
of narrative with Sugar23 as their new "futurist in residence,"
<https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/sugar23-douglas-rushkoff-futurist-in=
-residence-announcement-1235007672/>
writing
a weekly column for Medium <http://rushkoff.medium.com>, and making Team
Human <http://teamhuman.fm> even more human.

I've also started watching David Lynch's morning weather reports
<https://www.youtube.com/c/davidlynchtheater>. They help, for reasons still
pleasantly unknown.

Meanwhile, I've been staying off social media as much as possible. I'm
posting links to articles I've written, but trying not to look at people's
posts because it has started making me feel anxious. I contend that those
spaces are not an accurate reflection of who we are, and I've shared some
of my thinking about why that is, below.

Finally, I lost a friend and neighbor this week, Corrine Whitaker, who
dedicated her life to the health and empowerment of girls and women around
the world. She achieved a whole lot for many people, and modeled a
responsibility for others I can only hope to emulate.

Please take care and try to breathe easy,
Douglas



*Plunging Into the Abyss**As even our smartest friends fall to conspiracy
fever, we have to accept it's not about logic or politics, but addiction*

It comes in waves. A friend here, a co-worker there, getting curious about
one conspiracy theory or another until they follow one too many trailheads,
and end up over the edge. It's a casualty of living in disorienting times,
we tell ourselves. It will eventually pass.

But the hardest part is when the people we've traditionally looked to for
their brilliance and insights fall into this paranoid trap, as well. They
leave us wondering how this could happen to people smarter than ourselves.
As Kurt Andersen tweeted over the weekend, "Strangers turning en masse
these last decades into crazed crackpot conspiracy theorists has been bad
enough, but an educated, talented, funny, sweet, cosmopolitan old friend
plunging into that abyss is a really disturbing, depressing Invasion of the
Body Snatchers experience."

Many of us have been mourning the loss of some of our smartest friends to
extremism. I would say "extremism on both sides," but right now I am really
just referring to the side we used to call Q or alt-right, which has now
settled into a widespread belief that the compromises required to live
together in society are an affront to human liberty.

Yes, most of these people still do believe that Trump is returning as
president sometime soon, that Biden lost the election, that Obama and other
Democrat operatives hacked voting machines remotely from Italy and Germany,
that most versions of the vaccine are laced with nanobots, that the global
pederasty rings are still about to be revealed, that certain factions in
the military are ready to take over when they get the signal and, most
recently, that the withdrawal from Afghanistan is part of a secret deal
between Biden and his backers in China.

But these beliefs are not really the part that's so distressing to those of
us on the more conventional side of reality. No, the disturbing part =E2=80=
=94at
least to me =E2=80=94are not any of the particular fantasies they're hangin=
g onto,
but the stiffness and intransigence of it all. The angry, dogmatic manner
in which all this gets expressed and defended. There's never a lack of
sarcasm, or a reluctance to twist the knife. It's never "I fault Biden
for=E2=80=A6" It's always "of course a bumbling deep state crony like Biden=
 would=E2=80=A6"
There's never, ever, an assumption of good faith on the part of anyone
making choices on our behalf. Worse, when I call out a possible logical or
historical inconsistency in one of the narratives, the believer becomes
defensive to the point of being enraged.

It reminds me less of a political extremist =E2=80=94 right or left =E2=80=
=94 than an
addict defending their habit. And that's why I think we may be wrong to
categorize this as a cult phenomenon, rather than as an addiction.

To be sure, there are cult-like features in the fandom of Trump and the
Qanon community. But there's a point at which even a cult member can be
swayed with logic, interventions, or the failure of the cult leader's
prophecies to come true. I've engaged with many cult members, and their
demeanor is different. They spend more time trying to get me to join the
cult than defending their beliefs against contradiction, or their right and
obligation to defend those beliefs. They're usually not so actively angry,
but pacified and complacent. After all, they've found The Truth. They're
smiling, not griping or complaining that their griping has been
deplatformed.

I've got lots of friends asking "how could someone so smart have come to
believe this stuff?" But when you look at this through the lens of
addiction, that question no longer makes sense. I mean, do you ever ask,
"how could someone so smart have become an addict?" No, because addiction
is triggered and maintained by a whole different part of one's physical and
emotional makeup. If anything, the addiction enlists the person's
intelligence to maintain the supply of drugs and justification for
rejecting all efforts at helping them.

What are they addicted to? It's not the Q myth, Trump, or any particular
club or narrative. They're addicted to staying online and reading and
scrolling until they get that little dopamine rush that comes from
connecting one dot to another. Fauci-China-Gates-Covid-Epsten=E2=80=A6ah! I=
t's
delightful. It makes temporary sense. And then if they post the idea, it
gets a few hits and likes and comments from others, and ding ding squirt
squirt=E2=80=A6.another hit of dopamine. And another and another.

If you challenge the narrative, or try to bring them back to sense, then
you are undermining not just the story -=E2=80=94the politics or ideology=
=E2=80=94 their
justification for staying up all night trying to make connections. If, on
the other hand, we are genuinely threatened by Soros, Hillary, Fauci, and
the Deep State, then there is ample justification for sacrificing sleep,
friends, work, and one's mental health to the greater cause. Imagine if you
could justify taking a swig that way?

This also explains the belligerence with which those depending on the
anti-stories defend themselves. They don't just defend their narratives,
they defend their right to research, assemble, believe, and spread them.
Your intervention becomes grist for the mill -=E2=80=94part of the conspira=
cy, and
fuel for the addictive cycle. For this activity - this process =E2=80=94is =
itself
the addiction that they are so desperate to maintain.

To be sure, true believers on the Left and social justice extremes have
their own problems. I know many well-meaning but under-informed activists
who are more interested in prosecuting whoever they're told is the
oppressor than learning about colonialism, post-colonialism, theories of
change, why Martin Luther King turned his attention to class struggle, or
the neoliberal roots of today's non-violent protest movements. But we don't
"lose" friends to social justice in quite the same way, and there are
pro-market and pro-hegemonic people on the other side of the ideological
spectrum for them to argue against (the folks we used to call
conservatives).

These conspiracy obsessives are addicts, pure and simple. But addiction
doesn't occur in a vacuum. Like most addicts, deep down they are especially
sensitive human beings, responding inappropriately to the pain they're
experiencing in their environment. And these days, that doesn't just mean
their family, but our whole society.

That's why when I read their posts and articles, I try to ignore the
superficial, incorrect facts in order to hear the texture and sense of the
distress fueling them. And what I hear them saying is that the human soul
is withering under the weight of an increasingly atheist technocracy.
Between digital technology's perfect memory and capitalism's ruthlessness,
we were all being turned into thought criminals and jobless workers. Q's
global pederasty narrative served as a great metaphor for life under
international neoliberalism - how we are infantilized and shafted
simultaneously, by godless billionaires. The real point was that Americans
need to wake up to the corrupt global system -=E2=80=94the military industr=
ial
complex -=E2=80=94we are tacitly supporting. If we really saw how it operat=
es, we
would be horrified. This would be what Q people call the Great Awakening.

Likewise, Covid may not have been released intentionally by friends of
Fauci in a Chinese lab, but it is at the very least a symptom of a highly
technologized, interconnected world that lacks the transparency required to
keep us safe. Governments hide necessary information, the media is an
entertainment business, and our health departments seem more committed to
manufacturing consent for their vaccination recommendations than accurately
conveying the risk-reward ratios for various activities.

Addicts are very often the canaries in the coal mine. Their belligerence
usually just masks the tortured, vulnerable, and desperate person
underneath. They're addicted not because the substance they're taking
works, but because it does not really work.

All that our seemingly unreachable friends are trying to do is make some
sense of a world that is not functioning sensibly. Why would so much of the
world be "business as usual" if climate change were real? Why would homes
on Miami Beach be selling for millions of dollars if that property were
really going to be underwater in a decade? Why is the stock market going up
during a global plague? Why are all our computers made in China if they're
spying on us?

Nothing makes sense, and the most vulnerable among us have become addicted
to temporary, provisional sense-making online as a substitute for the real
thing.

So what can we do to help them? We can begin to acknowledge the
inconsistencies leading people to fall into this abyss. Things are not
going well, and we're all a part of the problem. Every time we buy a cheap
t-shirt we are supporting slave labor and putting someone out of a real
job. Every time we drive a car when we could walk, we are contributing to
both climate change and oil wars. Every time we move to a "better"
neighborhood to ensure quality education for our kids, we are perpetuating
a classist system that denies privileges to those without money. Every time
we let our leaders convince us that invading another country is in our best
interests, we kill people =E2=80=94including our neighbors' children.

These connections are real, and that is, to be sure, on us. But just as the
Czar used the antiSemitic fantasy Protocols of the Elders of Zion to
distract people from the real crimes of his regime, Trumpists are using
these new conspiracies to distract people from their own kleptocratic
corruption and efforts to reinstate mobster rule. That's just the cynical
exploitation of a widespread mental health problem.

Indeed, Qanon gives people as guilty as the rest of us an excuse to feel
superior and enlightened. As if tweeting mutual disdain for child sex
traffickers somehow absolves them of their association with the rest of
humanity. They think their messages will slowly brace us for the inevitable
comeuppance, the Great Awakening that reveals how everything is connected,
and how the governments of the world have been united in an effort to
extinguish the human soul through sexual programming, vaccinations, media
hypnosis, and online censorship. In other words, they are fighting a war to
defend this very obsession with reading and posting crazy stuff on social
media.

Those of us back here in reality must work together to enact a Gentle
Awakening for our friends and loved ones who have gotten addicted to this
video game. There is no man behind the curtain, no secret cabal controlling
our destinies, no marvelous or nefarious plan driving Covid, vote counting,
or global affairs. They need to awaken to something way way more
frightening than politicians eating children: shit just happens, no one is
in charge, and chaos reigns. There really is no scapegoat =E2=80=94never wa=
s. The
only way through is to find ways of coming together, instead.

One step, and one day at a time.

cial media as much as possible. I&#39;m posting links to articles I&#39;ve =
written, but trying not to look at people&#39;s posts because it has starte=
d making me feel anxious. I contend that those spaces are not an accurate r=
eflection of who we are, and I&#39;ve shared some of my thinking about why =
that is, below.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I lost a friend and=
 neighbor this week, Corrine Whitaker, who dedicated her life to the health=
 and empowerment of girls and women around the world. She achieved a whole =
lot for many people, and modeled a responsibility for others I can only hop=
e to emulate.</div><div><br></div><div>Please take care and try to breathe =
easy,</div><div>Douglas</div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div dir=3D=

gic or politics, but addiction</i><font size=3D"1"><br></font></div><div><i=
><br></i></div><div>It comes in waves. A friend here, a co-worker there, ge=
tting curious about one conspiracy theory or another until they follow one =
too many trailheads, and end up over the edge. It&#39;s a casualty of livin=
g in disorienting times, we tell ourselves. It will eventually pass.</div><=
div><br>But the hardest part is when the people we&#39;ve traditionally loo=
ked to for their brilliance and insights fall into this paranoid trap, as w=
ell. They leave us wondering how this could happen to people smarter than o=
urselves. As Kurt Andersen tweeted over the weekend, &quot;Strangers turnin=
g en masse these last decades into crazed crackpot conspiracy theorists has=
 been bad enough, but an educated, talented, funny, sweet, cosmopolitan old=
 friend plunging into that abyss is a really disturbing, depressing Invasio=
n of the Body Snatchers experience.&quot;</div><div><br>Many of us have bee=
n mourning the loss of some of our smartest friends to extremism. I would s=
ay &quot;extremism on both sides,&quot; but right now I am really just refe=
rring to the side we used to call Q or alt-right, which has now settled int=
o a widespread belief that the compromises required to live together in soc=
iety are an affront to human liberty.</div><div><br>Yes, most of these peop=
le still do believe that Trump is returning as president sometime soon, tha=
t Biden lost the election, that Obama and other Democrat operatives hacked =
voting machines remotely from Italy and Germany, that most versions of the =
vaccine are laced with nanobots, that the global pederasty rings are still =
about to be revealed, that certain factions in the military are ready to ta=
ke over when they get the signal and, most recently, that the withdrawal fr=
om Afghanistan is part of a secret deal between Biden and his backers in Ch=
ina.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But these beliefs are not really the pa=
rt that&#39;s so distressing to those of us on the more conventional side o=
f reality. No, the disturbing part=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94at least to me=E2=80=8A=
=E2=80=94are not any of the particular fantasies they&#39;re hanging onto, =
but the stiffness and intransigence of it all. The angry, dogmatic manner i=
n which all this gets expressed and defended. There&#39;s never a lack of s=
arcasm, or a reluctance to twist the knife. It&#39;s never &quot;I fault Bi=
den for=E2=80=A6&quot; It&#39;s always &quot;of course a bumbling deep stat=
e crony like Biden would=E2=80=A6&quot; There&#39;s never, ever, an assumpt=
ion of good faith on the part of anyone making choices on our behalf. Worse=
, when I call out a possible logical or historical inconsistency in one of =
the narratives, the believer becomes defensive to the point of being enrage=
d.</div><div><br>It reminds me less of a political extremist=E2=80=8A=E2=80=
=94=E2=80=8Aright or left=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Athan an addict defendin=
g their habit. And that&#39;s why I think we may be wrong to categorize thi=
s as a cult phenomenon, rather than as an addiction.</div><div><br>To be su=
re, there are cult-like features in the fandom of Trump and the Qanon commu=
nity. But there&#39;s a point at which even a cult member can be swayed wit=
h logic, interventions, or the failure of the cult leader&#39;s prophecies =
to come true. I&#39;ve engaged with many cult members, and their demeanor i=
s different. They spend more time trying to get me to join the cult than de=
fending their beliefs against contradiction, or their right and obligation =
to defend those beliefs. They&#39;re usually not so actively angry, but pac=
ified and complacent. After all, they&#39;ve found The Truth. They&#39;re s=
miling, not griping or complaining that their griping has been deplatformed=
.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve got lots of friends asking &quot;how co=
uld someone so smart have come to believe this stuff?&quot; But when you lo=
ok at this through the lens of addiction, that question no longer makes sen=
se. I mean, do you ever ask, &quot;how could someone so smart have become a=
n addict?&quot; No, because addiction is triggered and maintained by a whol=
e different part of one&#39;s physical and emotional makeup. If anything, t=
he addiction enlists the person&#39;s intelligence to maintain the supply o=
f drugs and justification for rejecting all efforts at helping them.</div><=
div><br>What are they addicted to? It&#39;s not the Q myth, Trump, or any p=
articular club or narrative. They&#39;re addicted to staying online and rea=
ding and scrolling until they get that little dopamine rush that comes from=
 connecting one dot to another. Fauci-China-Gates-Covid-Epsten=E2=80=A6ah! =
It&#39;s delightful. It makes temporary sense. And then if they post the id=
ea, it gets a few hits and likes and comments from others, and ding ding sq=
uirt squirt=E2=80=A6.another hit of dopamine. And another and another.</div=
><div><br>If you challenge the narrative, or try to bring them back to sens=
e, then you are undermining not just the story=E2=80=8A-=E2=80=94the politi=
cs or ideology=E2=80=94 their justification for staying up all night trying=
 to make connections. If, on the other hand, we are genuinely threatened by=
 Soros, Hillary, Fauci, and the Deep State, then there is ample justificati=
on for sacrificing sleep, friends, work, and one&#39;s mental health to the=
 greater cause. Imagine if you could justify taking a swig that way?</div><=
div><br>This also explains the belligerence with which those depending on t=
he anti-stories defend themselves. They don&#39;t just defend their narrati=
ves, they defend their right to research, assemble, believe, and spread the=
m. Your intervention becomes grist for the mill=E2=80=8A-=E2=80=94part of t=
he conspiracy, and fuel for the addictive cycle. For this activity=E2=80=8A=
-=E2=80=8Athis process=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94is itself the addiction that they a=
re so desperate to maintain.</div><div><br>To be sure, true believers on th=
e Left and social justice extremes have their own problems. I know many wel=
l-meaning but under-informed activists who are more interested in prosecuti=
ng whoever they&#39;re told is the oppressor than learning about colonialis=
m, post-colonialism, theories of change, why Martin Luther King turned his =
attention to class struggle, or the neoliberal roots of today&#39;s non-vio=
lent protest movements. But we don&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; friends to social=
 justice in quite the same way, and there are pro-market and pro-hegemonic =
people on the other side of the ideological spectrum for them to argue agai=
nst (the folks we used to call conservatives).</div><div><br></div><div>The=
se conspiracy obsessives are addicts, pure and simple. But addiction doesn&=
#39;t occur in a vacuum. Like most addicts, deep down they are especially s=
ensitive human beings, responding inappropriately to the pain they&#39;re e=
xperiencing in their environment. And these days, that doesn&#39;t just mea=
n their family, but our whole society.<br><br></div><div>That&#39;s why whe=
n I read their posts and articles, I try to ignore the superficial, incorre=
ct facts in order to hear the texture and sense of the distress fueling the=
m. And what I hear them saying is that the human soul is withering under th=
e weight of an increasingly atheist technocracy. Between digital technology=
&#39;s perfect memory and capitalism&#39;s ruthlessness, we were all being =
turned into thought criminals and jobless workers. Q&#39;s global pederasty=
 narrative served as a great metaphor for life under international neoliber=
alism=E2=80=8A-=E2=80=8Ahow we are infantilized and shafted simultaneously,=
 by godless billionaires. The real point was that Americans need to wake up=
 to the corrupt global system=E2=80=8A-=E2=80=94the military industrial com=
plex=E2=80=8A-=E2=80=94we are tacitly supporting. If we really saw how it o=
perates, we would be horrified. This would be what Q people call the Great =
Awakening.</div><div><br></div><div>Likewise, Covid may not have been relea=
sed intentionally by friends of Fauci in a Chinese lab, but it is at the ve=
ry least a symptom of a highly technologized, interconnected world that lac=
ks the transparency required to keep us safe. Governments hide necessary in=
formation, the media is an entertainment business, and our health departmen=
ts seem more committed to manufacturing consent for their vaccination recom=
mendations than accurately conveying the risk-reward ratios for various act=
ivities.<br><br></div><div>Addicts are very often the canaries in the coal =
mine. Their belligerence usually just masks the tortured, vulnerable, and d=
esperate person underneath. They&#39;re addicted not because the substance =
they&#39;re taking works, but because it does not really work.<br><br>All t=
hat our seemingly unreachable friends are trying to do is make some sense o=
f a world that is not functioning sensibly. Why would so much of the world =
be &quot;business as usual&quot; if climate change were real? Why would hom=
es on Miami Beach be selling for millions of dollars if that property were =
really going to be underwater in a decade? Why is the stock market going up=
 during a global plague? Why are all our computers made in China if they&#3=
9;re spying on us?</div><div><br>Nothing makes sense, and the most vulnerab=
le among us have become addicted to temporary, provisional sense-making onl=
ine as a substitute for the real thing.</div><div><br>So what can we do to =
help them? We can begin to acknowledge the inconsistencies leading people t=
o fall into this abyss. Things are not going well, and we&#39;re all a part=
 of the problem. Every time we buy a cheap t-shirt we are supporting slave =
labor and putting someone out of a real job. Every time we drive a car when=
 we could walk, we are contributing to both climate change and oil wars. Ev=
ery time we move to a &quot;better&quot; neighborhood to ensure quality edu=
cation for our kids, we are perpetuating a classist system that denies priv=
ileges to those without money. Every time we let our leaders convince us th=
at invading another country is in our best interests, we kill people=E2=80=
=8A=E2=80=94including our neighbors&#39; children.</div><div><br>These conn=
ections are real, and that is, to be sure, on us. But just as the Czar used=
 the antiSemitic fantasy Protocols of the Elders of Zion to distract people=
 from the real crimes of his regime, Trumpists are using these new conspira=
cies to distract people from their own kleptocratic corruption and efforts =
to reinstate mobster rule. That&#39;s just the cynical exploitation of a wi=
despread mental health problem.</div><div><br>Indeed, Qanon gives people as=
 guilty as the rest of us an excuse to feel superior and enlightened. As if=
 tweeting mutual disdain for child sex traffickers somehow absolves them of=
 their association with the rest of humanity. They think their messages wil=
l slowly brace us for the inevitable comeuppance, the Great Awakening that =
reveals how everything is connected, and how the governments of the world h=
ave been united in an effort to extinguish the human soul through sexual pr=
ogramming, vaccinations, media hypnosis, and online censorship. In other wo=
rds, they are fighting a war to defend this very obsession with reading and=
 posting crazy stuff on social media.</div><div><br>Those of us back here i=
n reality must work together to enact a Gentle Awakening for our friends an=
d loved ones who have gotten addicted to this video game. There is no man b=
ehind the curtain, no secret cabal controlling our destinies, no marvelous =
or nefarious plan driving Covid, vote counting, or global affairs. They nee=
d to awaken to something way way more frightening than politicians eating c=
hildren: shit just happens, no one is in charge, and chaos reigns. There re=
ally is no scapegoat=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94never was. The only way through is to=
 find ways of coming together, instead.</div><div><br>One step, and one day=
 at a time.<i><br></i></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><d=
