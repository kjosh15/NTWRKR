In F plus you are only insured for accident when you are not working or dri=
ving vehicle. Leisure accident insurance.

In car insurance you have special accident insurance for people.

And if you are working your employer should have insurance for you.

All this insurance are different when we talk about what they should pay fo=
r and how much.

You should be able to find the terms of all these insurances in englis on v=
is.is

I hop that will help.

Best regards

Thanks so much for this; my apologies for taking so long to get back to you=

Can you help me understand the difference between accident insurance and le=
isure accident insurance? Again, I'm trying to compare the policy I have in=
 the US to what you offer, and I suspect the difference might be significan=

Thanks!

I'll set up an offer for the life insurance but can't give you the price ju=
st yet.

Concerning the questions about accident insurance in the F+ packages. First=
 of all we're not talking about over all accident insurance but leisure acc=
ident insurance and so my answers are based on that.

a) Let's say that you have the F+3 package. The maximum insurance amount fo=
r disability is 33.153.000 ISK. The amount is based on the disability you w=
ould be assessed for.

b)The benefit period is 46 weeks, waiting time 6 weeks. So if you would be =
unable to work for a longer period than 6 weeks you'd receive benefits dail=
y - ISK 27.000 a day.

c)The premium for just this part of the insurance is ISK 16.099. Exemption =
from premium is not offered in F+

d)The monthly cost really depends on the rest of the package because this l=
eisure accident insurance is included in the packages 2-4.

e)Each category is differently priced. F+4 has the highest insurance amount=
 and the lowest deductible, and therefor the most expensive one. F+1 does n=
ot offer the leisure accident insurance and so the F+2 has the lowest insur=
ance amount and the highest deductible.

Hopefully this gives you a more clear image of our F+ leisure accident insu=
rance and please let me/us know if you have more questions or if anything w=
as misunderstood :)

Kind regards,

Subject: Followup Questions
I wanted to follow up on these questions:


1) In regards to your Life Insurance policy:

a. Your agent said "You can choose the amount yourself, and what controls w=
hat you pay for the insurance is your age, the amount that you want to be i=
nsured. There is just one policy for life insurance."
Right now I have a US Life Insurance policy for $500,000 USD which costs $1=
30.27 USD every 3 months. I am 46 years old; what would your policy cost to=
 insure for a similar amount?


2) In regards to the Accident Insurance:

a. It looks like the FPlus plans cover quite a bit more than just disabilit=
y, but that for disability payments you give between 24,000,000 - 50,000,00=
0 ISK. Is that amount a yearly payout or a total amount?

b. How long is the maximum benefit period?

c. Is there a premium, and if so under what conditions may it be waived?

d. What is the monthly cost? Can you give me a range?

e. Finally, the list at https://vis.is/samanburdur-a-f-plus-fjolskyldutrygg=
ingum/ seem to include four different "families" of insurance (F plus 1, F =
plus 2, F plus 3 and F plus 4), but under these are twelve different catego=
ries of coverage. Does each "family" include all the different categories i=
n one fee or plan, or is each category a differently priced offering?

<div dir=3D"ltr">I wanted to follow up on these questions:<br clear=3D"none=

1) In regards to your Life Insurance policy:<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
a. Your agent said &quot;You can choose the amount yourself, and what contr=
ols what you pay for the insurance is your age, the amount that you want to=
 be insured. There is just one policy for life insurance.&quot;&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Right now I have a US Life Insurance policy for $500,000 USD which cos=
ts $130.27 USD every 3 months. I am 46 years old; what would your policy co=
st to insure for a similar amount?<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
2) In regards to the Accident Insurance:<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
a. It looks like the FPlus plans cover quite a bit more than just disabilit=
y, but that for disability payments you give between 24,000,000 - 50,000,00=
0 ISK. Is that amount a yearly payout or a total amount?<br clear=3D"none" =
/>
<br clear=3D"none" />
b. How long is the maximum benefit period?<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
c. Is there a premium, and if so under what conditions may it be waived?<br=
 clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
d. What is the monthly cost? Can you give me a range?<br clear=3D"none" />
<br clear=3D"none" />
e. Finally, the list at <a href=3D"https://vis.is/samanburdur-a-f-plus-fjol=
skyldutryggingum/" shape=3D"rect" target=3D"_blank">https://vis.is/samanbur=
dur-a-f-plus-fjolskyldutryggingum/</a> seem to include four different &quot=
;families&quot; of insurance (F plus 1, F plus 2, F plus 3 and F plus 4), b=
ut under these are twelve different categories of coverage. Does each &quot=
;family&quot; include all the different categories in one fee or plan, or i=
s each category a differently priced offering?<br clear=3D"none" />
