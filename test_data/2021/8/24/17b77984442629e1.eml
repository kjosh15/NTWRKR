Awesome! The plans, not the huge delays part. Still, sounds like you're
going to have a hell of a place set up when all is said and done. And
what's the bulldog's name?

Let me spend some quality time with YouTube on how to use the glue before I
ask you to dig anything up. I need to wait for the order to be filled to my
aunt in CA, and then for her to pack and send it, and then for it to
arrive... so we'll have some time.

That said, been seeing the resident raven family around. As much as I try
to avoid anthropomorphizing them they did circle me twice when they first
saw me; familiar behavior from when I was feeding them last fall. Stoked to
finally get a box out for them!!
