Thank you for contacting the CBP Traveler Communications Center. We apologize for the difficulty you are experiencing submitting your TTP application. Please see the list below for common causes for this.

Payment issue: The payment site is temporarily down. Please try again in a few hours.
Unspecified error in the "Documents" section: There is a known issue with renewal applications that we are working diligently with our IT team to resolve. As a temporary workaround, please cancel your renewal application and start over. When you first log into your account, below the button that says "Continue Application" there is another button that says "Cancel Application". Click "Cancel Application" and confirm the cancellation when the pop-up asks if you are sure. Then, proceed to click the Renew Membership button on your existing or expired membership. Once these steps are followed, you should be able to complete your application without further issue.
Address issues: The address history section will ask you to provide all locations where you have lived in the last 5 years. The system will allow you to start on January 1st, 2014 if it does not accept earlier dates.
Employment history: Make sure that there are no gaps in your employment history. If you had any periods of unemployment, make sure that you provide those dates.

If you are still unable to submit, please reply to this email with a screenshot of the error that you are seeing and the following information so that we can escalate to our information technology team.

Error code (if any)
PASSID
login.gov email address
platform and browser
timezone
TTP function (initially-enrolling, renewing, reapplying, etc.. )
If you need further assistance, please reply to this email and we will investigate how we may further assist you.

Thank you again for contacting the Traveler Communications Center.
