Good to hear from you! Fully escaped; we're in a 14-room farmhouse in the
Icelandic countryside where I'm building a startup that algorithmically
changes employee behavior ... and not getting Covid. Would love to connect
and catch up; my cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling> or suggest a time
that works GMT when you get a chance!

All best,
Josh
