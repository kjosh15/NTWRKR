Thanks so much for the kind invitation, Marcel! Can you clarify if this is
a virtual, in-person, or hybrid event? Also, am I right in reading this
that you're inviting me to sit on the panel with the folks you mentioned,
and if so will there be a briefing in advance on potential questions and
topics to cover?

I'm excited about the opportunity to share with your community, and looking
forward to what is sure to be a lively and insightful discussion!!

All best,
Josh
