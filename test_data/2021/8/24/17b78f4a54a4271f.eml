Hi Josh,

That's perfect! We'll get you set up for split payments and direct deposit.
A few notes:

Macmillan's NY offices will be closed until October 18, 2021, during which
time we're unable to mail printed statements while we work remotely. We
will continue to provide electronic statements, but as this process is
heavily manual and can't currently be automated we ask that you kindly send
a new request for each royalty period to this email address with a copy of
the remittance advice or your payee number. This is a temporary measure.
We=E2=80=99ll return to printed statements sometime after our offices reope=
n. Your
next statement will be ready at the end of January, so hopefully we're back
to automatically mailing physical statements then, but feel free to check
with us at this email address.

In your initial email to Katie, you asked if we could send you and Mollie
Glick copies of notices and royalty reports we send to Foundry. I'm afraid
our system can't accommodate that automatically. Jeff Gerecke has taken
over bookkeeping for Foundry--you can email him at foundryaccts@gmail.com
to request documents. Going forward, we'll prepare separate statements for
Foundry's 15% and your 85%. Per above, you can request yours when you
receive a payment, or when they're ready at the of each January and July
while your titles are unearned. Your payee number is 1312003698. For now,
attached is your April 2021 statement that we sent to Foundry at the end of
July.

Thanks,
Mike
