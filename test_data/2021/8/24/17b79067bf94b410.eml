No worries; we met in DC at Summit some ten years ago when I impressed you
with my knowledge of duck penis'. I came by yours and played werewolf a
couple times, you introduced me to Jeffro, the founder of Crowdrise, and
then I vanished into doing tv series for a while.

Now I'm in Iceland, which is very safe and very beautiful but not
particularly full of interesting people - hence my outreach. I'm currently
creating software <http://indigometrics.com> to change people's behavior
algorithmically and at scale.

Let me know if you want to catch up sometime and compare notes on the last
decade!

All best,
Josh
