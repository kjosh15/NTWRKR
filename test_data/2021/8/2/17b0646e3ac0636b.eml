Sam, do you have a timeline for the remaining episodes? I want to make sure
and deliver the requisite social media but have no way of knowing when the
new EPs are coming out.

Separately, do you know if there are any "official" stats about the success
of the show that I can put in my collateral and share with reposters? I
know we had some pretty good numbers as of dinner a couple weeks ago - what
are the big numbers worth repeating (as far as Accenture and NYTimes are
concerned) now?

Thanks!!
- J
