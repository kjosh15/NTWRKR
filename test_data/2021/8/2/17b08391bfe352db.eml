Hey dude, welcome to Iceland! My wife and I loved our time there.

If you haven=E2=80=99t figured it out yet, the key to surviving the summer i=
s redundant blackout curtains and a high-quality sleep mask. The key to surv=
iving the winter is a strong regimen of vitamin D, cod liver oil, a SAD lamp=
 (I did 2x treatments each morning) and a short trip to somewhere sunny in m=
id-January.

Other random things:

If you like beer, go to RVK Brewing and ask for Siggi or Einar Orn and tell t=
hem I sent you. Both are lovely people who spent time in the US and can poin=
t you to interesting goings on. Other spots are Skuli craft bar and Micro Ba=
r (ask for Viktor and tell him I sent you), both within stumbling distance o=
f each other with Mandi in between, who makes a solid falafel with a to die f=
or homemade tahini. (There=E2=80=99s no good Tahini in Iceland.)

Food is mostly overpriced and terrible, we shopped at Bonus and tried to mos=
tly buy islenskt graenmeti produce=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the mark of Iceland g=
rown vegetables and the only fresh/carbon sane stuff you can get there. We=E2=
=80=99re lactose intolerant and ate Arna Skyr constantly.

Restaurant-wise, most of it didn=E2=80=99t justify the cost. Here=E2=80=99s w=
hat did: Osta budin was my favorite for fiskur dagsins (fish of the day) whe=
n it was on skolavastogur, but they=E2=80=99ve since moved. When friends wer=
e in town, we=E2=80=99d take them to Messin where good seafood was only $40/=
plate or bryggan brugghus because it was casual and open later than anyone e=
lse. I remember the token vegan thing being the best thing on the menu. If y=
ou want some authentic old-school Icelandic food, hit up three frakkar / thr=
ee coats.=20

Out of Reykjavik, we liked Olverk in hveragerdi for pizza/beer after a hike.=
 Tjorhusid in Isafjordur was by far the best meal in the country=E2=80=94so g=
ood that we made a reservation for the next night when we were there the fir=
st time. The second best was Slipurinn on the Vestmann Islands=E2=80=94proba=
bly the only fine dining that was worth the effort and Jon Riki in the East w=
as nice as well.=20

As for where to go, comb through the Try On Adventure section of Sweatpantbo=
ots.com. I wrote the script based on my personal favorite things to do, plus=
 the two new things=E2=80=94the volcano (obvs) and Studlagil Canyon in the e=
ast. Missing is most of the westfjords (the bestfjords=E2=80=94I could happi=
ly get lost there for a month.) Siglofjordur in the north (awesome little fi=
shing town) and the vestmann islands. And if there=E2=80=99s a concert you w=
ant to see at Havari Farm, make a weekend out of it=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a s=
pecial place.

If you need any tips/advise, go ahead and reach out. We left because the job=
 wasn=E2=80=99t what it was supposed to be, but I absolutely loved the cultu=
re, nature and the friends we made. My wife still wishes we lived there. Des=
pite leaving in the summer of 2018, I kept in touch with my old colleagues a=
nd clients and spent the last year working on Iceland Tourism remotely from C=
alifornia.
