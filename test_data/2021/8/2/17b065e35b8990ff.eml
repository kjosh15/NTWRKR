Not sure if you're the right person for this; if not can you point me in
the right direction?

As a result of the recent changes at Foundry Media, I would like to request
that my payments be bifurcated from here on out, with my share of advances,
royalties and any other payments sent directly to me. I would also like to
request that my former Foundry agent, Mollie Glick, and myself receive
copies of all notices and royalty reports that are sent to Foundry. Please
cc me when you send these notes.

Thanks!!
Joshua Klein
