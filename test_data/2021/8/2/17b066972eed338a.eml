Ross,

I'm still available if you can get me there! In terms of content, I've been
staying on top of the radical new technologies that have been coming out
over the last couple years (the end of the "great stagnation" as the
economist Tyler Cowen would claim) but more specifically have been diving
deeply into how organizations use and misuse data to drive culture change,
create more flexible organizational structures, and outcompete less nimble
competitors ... especially in a new era of Distributed Autonomous
Organizations, algorithmically-driven behavior change, and radically
distributed workforce.

Let me know how / if any of those topics hit closer to the mark - excited
to see this event actually happen!!

All best,
Josh

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=E2=80=9CIntelligence is the ability to adapt to cha=
nge.=E2=80=9D So said the English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and a=
uthor Stephen Hawking.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The conceptual definition refers to intelligence as =
the ability to learn from experience, recognize patterns, comprehend ideas,=
 solve problems, use our knowledge to adapt to new situations and use langu=
age to communicate. In research studies,
 intelligence is whatever the intelligence test measures, which could vary =
by culture and region.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Artificial intelligence and human intelligence delve=
 into cognitive functions such as memory, problem-solving, learning, planni=
ng, language, reasoning, and perception. AI is an innovation created by hum=
an intelligence and it is designed
 to do specific tasks much faster with less effort. But with machine learni=
ng, the system itself has the ability to automatically learn and improve fr=
om experience without being explicitly programmed.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">On the other hand, human intelligence is better at m=
ulti-tasking. It can incorporate emotional elements, human interaction, as =
well as self-awareness in the cognitive process.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Given how diverse an individual=E2=80=99s abilities =
are, it may not be justifiable to label all those abilities into a single w=
ord, intelligence. Perhaps these diverse abilities represent different kind=
s of intelligence.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Was Dustin Hoffman=E2=80=99s Rain Man character inte=
lligent? While he had significant mental disabilities, as a savant, he demo=
nstrated certain mathematical and memory abilities far in excess of average=
. What about Toulouse-Lautrec or Beethoven,
 both of whom suffered medical maladies and were deemed artistic geniuses, =
but were they intelligent? Some researchers have also concluded that plants=
 exhibit the simple forms of behavior that neuroscientists describe as basi=
c intelligence.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At this, our 17th annual Executive Conference, we wi=
ll address a variety of ways intelligence can be defined, how it affects th=
e financial services ecosystem and society at large, as well as introduce t=
he power of what humans can produce
 through perseverance, empathy and self-awareness.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As our experiences with Amazon, Google, AirBnB and o=
