Thanks again for the conversation on Friday; it was exciting to hear how
our platform might be relevant for a company like Lululemon's, and I
appreciate your letting me know about Tom!

Pursuant our conversation, I'd suggest we schedule a call to walk through
our sandbox so you can see what the dashboards look like, the kind of data
the platform produces, and what the user experience is like. If you'd like
to invite some tech folks to the call I can answer any
implementation/integration questions at the same time.

I'm really excited about the possibility of working with a company like
Lululemon because you have such a powerful and integrated view of culture
through the entire organizational stack. That's unique, and represents an
excellent opportunity to help employees accelerate their impact (and
potentially bridge some schisms) while also creating data to track insight
into your core values company-wide.

Let me know if I can provide any further info, and/or when a good time for
a followup call might be!

All best,
Josh
