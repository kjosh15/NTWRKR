Marc, Ashley,

Thanks so much for the call yesterday! I wanted to follow up on the
conversation to echo what I had heard and to help frame up my thinking
prior to your sending any writeups/decks my way for feedback.

Based on what was discussed I noted four potentials:

*1. Using video with the leaders we interview for the podcast to produce
more multimodal material*

Building in a little extra time to create a human connection with the
leader before/after the call - to capture the leader as a real, relatable
person - is a big value-add, especially if we can capture and use that
content elsewhere. Similarly, having 2-3 questions we could ask every
leader, again to emphasize the human element, would produce some really
interesting content that will emphasize the business material it's paired
with.

*2. Envision as a partnered engagement*

I'm in touch with the producer from Microsoft; how else can I help in
pushing this forward on the Accenture side?

*3. Subsidiary podcast segments*

Whether these be 3-5 minute pieces on specific customers, partnerships, or
technologies from Labs, a series of shorter, more focused podcasts could
help drastically expand the scope of listeners. I personally LOVE the idea
of doing a tech-focused series based on implementations or joint projects
coming from not only the labs, but also from the different business
segments.

For example, I recently spoke to your HR Data team, and they're doing some
very interesting research into how the data we're collecting around
employee behavior is changing management strategy. Again, it's the
intersection of business, technology, and real human experience that makes
it interesting! And as long as we frame each piece against the larger
rubric of the Built for Change podcast content categories it all creates
aggregate momentum (as well as material that can be used in multiple
ways/mediums!)

*4. "Live from..." video series*

To connect with Accenture leaders, customers, and technologies on-site.
Pending Covid restrictions easing, but you know my first suggestion is
going to be interviewing the Accenture leadership team at a hot spring in
Iceland!!

Let me know if I have the right buckets to be thinking about, and/or if I
can expand on any of the above to help with the pitches you are making
internally.

All best,
Josh
