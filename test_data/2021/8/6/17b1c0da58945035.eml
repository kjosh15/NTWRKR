Can I track my US Credit Card expenses using your software?

Alternatively, I only see the three credit cards listed on your site, and
none of them have points for expenses (as well as very high annual
charges.) Am I missing something, and/or do you support any other cards in
your expense tracking software?

Takk!
Josh
