Dear Friends and Family,



We hope this note finds you well and healthy.  We are settling in to our
new home and busier than ever! We enjoyed our visit with Pinky and Susie
and already miss them. Hannah and Pierce will soon be driving from Oregon
to Virginia with all of their belongings to move into their first home, as
Hannah has now completed her Barr exam. We are looking forward to her visit
here later this month!  Ireland is opening up. Over 75% of the country is
now fully vaccinated and the number of people getting the jab increases
every day.  According to polls, only 6% of people in Ireland are reluctant
to get vaccinated.  This means we should be reaching herd immunity next
month!  Eric and I have digital certificates on our phones, which is a QR
code that verifies we are vaccinated, allowing us to eat inside
restaurants.



The Dingle Way



We met up with Pinky and Susie in Dingle  on Friday the 16th for our walk.
They had already walked 2 days,  from Camp to Annascaul and then from
Annascaul to Dingle. Friday was a rest day for them and they had just
returned from a boat tour to the Baskin Islands and were eating fish and
chips when we arrived.  After a small snafu involving getting locked out
the B&B that I won't get into, we went to a lovely beer garden and then
picked up some pizza.  The next day we embarked on the toughest leg of our
journey from Dingle to Dunquinn. It was a particularly hot day, there was a
lot of up and the trail had not been very well travelled resulting in ample
vegetation to trudge through with lots of bugs. But alas we persevered
thanks to a great lunch break and a well placed stream, and we arrived at a
lovely stone cottage where we were greeted by a wonderful couple and a very
cute dog.



The homemade meal with fresh vegetables straight from our hosts garden
revived our spirits and the next leg to Ballydavid was delightful.  After
it was decided that we would follow the yellow man and not the monk, we
arrived at a beach and mom and I cooled off by walking barefoot through the
surf. We made it to our destination early and enjoyed a pint at the only
restaurant in town, Tigh T.P., a restaurant we would come to know well as
we had a rest day in Ballydavid and ate there for all our meals except
breakfast.



On our rest day we walked to Cill Maoilch=C3=A9adair, an old church ruin th=
at
had a sun dial and an ogham stone, which is the earliest form of written
Irish. From there, we followed the yellow monk up a hill to a gorgeous view
of the area. We were looking for an old rock which turned out to be at the
bottom of the hill in a field right next to the church but the view was
worth the climb.





The next day we were driven to the base of Mt. Brandon for our greatest
elevation gain of the walk. It was a foggy start and it was sometimes hard
to find the little yellow man but the fog dissipated as we climbed and had
burned off by the time we reached the top. The walk down was a bit
treacherous as the trail was under construction,  there were white bags
full of rocks that had been helicoptrered in on the trail that had to be
navigated around. We worked well as a team with effective communication as
Eric lead us down to more even ground.  It was a simple walk after that to
O'connor's bar and guesthouse in Cloghane. Because we were staying there,
we were able to have drinks in the bar, inside! Pinky even found a guitar
to play.



The last day of our journey took us along Fermoyle Beach, the longest beach
in Ireland where we again enjoyed walking barefoot through the water.  We
decided to take a shorter path to our final destination of Castlegregory
and not transverse the whole peninsula.  Castlegregory was a great little
town with a fantastic outdoor pub and a very dramatic history:

Mary the taxi driver picked us up the next morning and took us back to the
car. It was a great trip and my parents are amazing! We had lunch in Adare
on the way home and stopped at Obama Plaza for ice cream.  There is even
talk of another walking tour, maybe in Italy, in the future!



Settling In



Boxes continue to arrive here at the Frazier Family Farm. We now have beds
in all the bedrooms and two workable, if not entirely finished guestrooms!
It is feeling  a little bit cozier here everyday as the rooms become more
complete and we figure out all the workings of our house.  My folks hung
around here for a few more days after the hike, long enough to have drinks
with the neighbors, Teresa and Doney(who plays keyboards in a fairly
successful Irish Country music band).  Doney filled my dad with dreams of
playing with his all astronaut band, MaxQ, at Sean=E2=80=99s Bar.  Dad got =
to go
with Eric and our neighbor Padraigh(paw-rig) to load peat from the bog into
Padraigh=E2=80=99s trailer, possibly one of the most quintessential Irish
experiences you can have!  Eric and Dad also paid a visit to Sean=E2=80=99s=
 Bar for
a few pints as we can do that now that things are opening up!   As sad as
it was to see my parents go, it is nice to know that it won=E2=80=99t be an=
other
year and a half until we can see them again.



Eric and I are also now kept company by 5 two-year old black angus cows.
They arrived last week and will be staying with us for about 5 weeks to
feed on two of our paddocks.  What I have realized is that I knew very
little about cows. For instance, cows are pretty fast runners and they are
very playful.  They are super curious but also a bit timid.  They can climb
things and they can jump. We discovered this last fact as we sat down to
eat lunch a few days ago and saw 2 of the cows in the wrong paddock.  Upon
further investigation, we figure out that those 2 cows had climbed the
small stone wall that is part of the tree circle and jumped, or
belly-flopped into the paddock next door taking part of the fence with
them.  One of the cow=E2=80=99s bellies got scraped up a little but they we=
re very
happy to have made it to a new part of the farm!  The other cows, who did
not make the perilous journey were not as happy and complained loudly until
we managed to get them reunited.  We think we have the problem solved now
as Eric has blocked off the tree circle with a make-shift fence.



One of the benefits of having the cows here is that their poop is great for
composting!  I have a nice little pile going out by the barn which has also
helped us clear out dried and freshly cut vegetation from some of the other
areas.  It feels great to not be throwing our compostable food in the trash
anymore.  We have been working on a tree survey of the land and have
discovered that there are many hazel trees, as well as, ash trees, oaks,
blackthorn trees, red alders, a sycamore tree, a European beech tree and a
wych elm.  I am looking forward to attempting to make homemade Nutella this
fall.  In the more immediate future, there are more blackberries on our
property than we will be able to pick.  I guess that means I now need to
learn how to can things, and learn how to make blackberry jam. We have so
much to do and so much to learn but we are happy to be on this path.


We hope that some of you will be able to come for a visit!



Take care of yourselves and each other,



Much Love,

Eric and Marti

Dingle

up a little but they were very happy to have made it to a new part of the f=
arm!=C2=A0 The other cows, who did not make the perilous journey were not a=
s happy and complained loudly until we managed to get them reunited.=C2=A0 =
We think we have the problem solved now as Eric has blocked off the tree ci=

benefits of having the cows here is that their poop is great for composting=
!=C2=A0 I have a nice little pile going out by the barn which has also help=
ed us clear out dried and freshly cut vegetation from some of the other are=
as.=C2=A0 It feels great to not be throwing our compostable food in the tra=
sh anymore.=C2=A0 We have been working on a tree survey of the land and hav=
e discovered that there are many hazel trees, as well as, ash trees, oaks, =
blackthorn trees, red alders, a sycamore tree, a European beech tree and a =
wych elm.=C2=A0 I am looking forward to attempting to make homemade Nutella=
 this fall.=C2=A0 In the more immediate future, there are more blackberries=
 on our property than we will be able to pick.=C2=A0 I guess that means I n=
ow need to learn how to can things, and learn how to make blackberry jam. W=
e have so much to do and so much to learn but we are happy to be on this pa=
