Hey Gustavo, I hope life is treating you well! Let me know how your plans
are progressing.

In the meantime, let's get the remaining items between us wrapped up:

- What items do you want to keep, and what would you like to pay for them?

- What do you think we could sell before you move out (so we can
collaborate to get them sold)?

Some items in the latter category that come to mind are the mirror, the
water filter, the instapot, the benches, and maybe the chair and some
lamps. Can you think of anything else? Additionally, the beds and
mattresses are to go to Weena's family.

Let me know where we stand on the above, and thanks again for all your help
while I was in NYC. We are living in interesting times; it's great to be
together with people aligned on positive outcomes for all.

All best,
Josh
