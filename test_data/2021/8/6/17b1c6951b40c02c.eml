Sturla,

Firstly, I hope you're enjoying a good summer vacation. Secondly, I have an
odd question for you; we have life and disability insurance through
providers in the USA (benefits detailed below) and are having a hell of a
time doing a comparison to the equivalent in Iceland. A number of these
benefits are covered by the state, and the closest analogues I can find are
from VIS - but they're not easily comparable.

Do you have a feeling for whether these benefits are replicable through
Icelandic coverage, or know who I can ask to get clarify? VIS simply don't
understand my questions.

Many thanks,
Josh
