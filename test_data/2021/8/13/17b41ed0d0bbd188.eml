Hello=E2=80=A6a week later still=E2=80=A6

We arrived in SF on the 6th after a 15 hour drive. We just had to get =
here! We went from 110 to 53 degrees and luckily I knew to pack a =
turtleneck, jeans and a sweat shirt. We actually landed in Berkeley at =
my friend Miryam house and stayed there for a week as our apartment =
won=E2=80=99t be ready for another 2 weeks and until last Tuesday, the =
moving company didn=E2=80=99t know where our stuff was=E2=80=A6( breath =
breath) . Luckily, Miryam and her family were gone until yesterday, so =
we had a nice familiar and quiet space to hang out in. As of yesterday, =
we=E2=80=99re  are now staying in my sister's in SF living room until =
the apartment upstairs is done. Seems like the rest of our stuff will =
come this monday=E2=80=A6all good.=20
It=E2=80=99s a joy to be here and I=E2=80=99m more eager everyday to get =
settled. Our in person classes have already been scaled back( the breath =
work portion has been canceled)  with all of the new restrictions due to =
the delta variant. I haven=E2=80=99t had a moment to myself, longer than =
a shower, for 6 weeks and am getting eager to have my office set up. I =
do my best thinking when I can have several hours of think, read, write, =
think again and sometimes draw.=20
I=E2=80=99m getting a lot of offer to join things and participate in =
organizations. I=E2=80=99m trying to still be slow about my decision =
making on what to say yes to. And, more importantly, what to trust and =
say no to.=20

Wondering how you are=E2=80=A6ha. All of the things that NYC had for =
you. All that you interacted with=E2=80=A6your apartment and the sublet, =
the pilot, just wondering around and being in NYC?? Is it so far behind =
already? Not asking for report as much as just wondering how you are and =
how staying in iceland for another year will be. Here comes the darkness =
again=E2=80=A6:)

You and I have a good organic connection=E2=80=A6It may not be like last =
year, which I treasure, but I=E2=80=99m grateful and looking forward to =
seeing what emerges.=20
My best and congrats to Hulda!
Love, B
