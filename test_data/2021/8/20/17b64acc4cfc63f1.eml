Sarah, please meet Ashley - she's one of the great minds behind the Built
for Change podcast I've been having so much fun with for Accenture. I was
telling her about Happily's capabilities and suggested it would be worth a
call, if only so they knew how, when, and where they could use you as they
continue to grow!

Ashley, I've known Sarah for years and she *always* impresses. Needless to
say I'd love any excuse to do something with her on behalf of Accenture,
but would be happy to see what she could do for you in any capacity.

All best wishes,
Josh
