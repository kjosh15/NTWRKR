Would love to but am very underwater for the next couple weeks; want to
schedule a time thereafter?

All best,

<br>
As you both know, I=E2=80=99ve been professionally pausing for the past 4+ =
years out of respect and humility regarding my own unconscious ego mechanis=
ms. I=E2=80=99ve been waiting for an inner-directed call to action if I wer=

me so corrupted as to be accelerating existential risks, not ameliorating t=
hem.<br>
<br>
My perception of the core issues at this time in history are the meta-compl=
ex of (at least):<br>
1) perverse financial incentives<br>
2) institutional capture across the board<br>
3) inherent limitations of individual cognition / sense making<br>
4) individual and collective spiral developmental levels <br>
<br>
My perception of a possible antidote is a marketplace / wagering system of =
truth claims which binds truth to money and is designed to be antifragile w=
.r.t. this binding.<br>
<br>
My vision is that of a DAO in which your betting track record over time giv=
es you more influence on the signal of truth or falsity for any given claim=
 in the system. All activity has cost or risk associated with it for the in=
dividuals, and it has significant financial reward possible. You can bet on=
 your own truth claims, other people=E2=80=99s claims or individuals themse=
lves. There=E2=80=99s a dynamic rating system for individuals similar to ch=
ess ratings, and for individual claims (i.e. truth is a dynamic measurement=
 that can fluctuate over time as more data and arguments are brought in).<b=

solete.=E2=80=9D What I envision is a system would sit largely outside of t=

 earnest heterodox thinkers who are marginalized and demonetized by their i=
nstitutions and the establishment. At an emergent level, inconvenient truth=
 would come out of the DAO and if there are people and institutions who car=
e to use the data, it=E2=80=99s there.<br>
<br>
I=E2=80=99m sensitive to the fact that the way I=E2=80=99m thinking about a=
