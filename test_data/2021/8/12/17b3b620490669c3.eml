Do you or someone you know have an old iPhone 6 (or newer) in a drawer
somewhere? Before that generation you cannot put parental controls in
place. Othinn has one with parental controls which works great... and now
Haakon is chomping at the bit.

We're using the phones as extremely slimmed-down devices (only a few
pre-vetted learning games that they can only use for 20m a day plus tools
for projects, allowance, chores, etc.) to empower the boys, but without the
parental controls it's hard to keep on top of. Any suggestions/help/ideas
are appreciated, and if you could ask around a bit that'd be even better!!!!

Many many thanks and big xoxo,
Josh
