Hey Josh,

Thanks so much! I was thinking about you today as I was vacuuming the
house, you know cause its Floorsday. There are many spiders here, harmless
little guys, but they are all over the place.   I remembered visiting you
in Issaquah when we were in High School and you had declared peace with the
spiders living in your room.  That has always stuck with me.  I like
spiders,  I really do, I have always tried to gently move them outside when
I find them in my house or wherever but Josh there are just so many here.
So here I am with the vacuum,  sucking up spiders, feeling pangs of guilt
with each one and thinking to myself, what would Josh think of this.

I hope we can still be friends.

Take care,

Marti

r all the t&#39;s to be crossed and i&#39;s dotted, we finally closed on ou=
r house!=C2=A0 We now live just a wee bit west of the geographical center o=
f Ireland! Moving our stuff from the apartment was the easy part. Eric has =
some wonderful friends from work that helped us move and we were able to ge=
t most of the stuff moved in one trip. We did not move to Ireland with many=
 material possessions and managed to not add too many new items in our time=
 here. Of course that means that now that we have a house, there are many t=
hings we need.=C2=A0 Deliveries are arriving at a steady pace and we now ha=
ve actual beds in 2 of the rooms, for the record they are much more comfort=
able than air mattresses! We have managed to meet most of our immediate nei=
ghbours and are feeling really welcome here. I was invited by one neighbor =
to join a group that swims in the lake (Lough Ree) every weekend! We were e=
ven invited to our neighbor Paddy&#39;s for tea and the England vs. Italy g=
ame on Sunday.=C2=A0 This house is a project rich environment,=C2=A0 there =
is so much to do and we have so much land! Paddy was also kind enough to ha=
rvest the silage in our paddocks which we will get paid for and we will let=
 his cows graze the edges and one of our paddocks that was too steep to har=
vest.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I am looking into taking some courses on beekeeping.=C2=
=A0 Eric is anxious to start an orchard.=C2=A0 It is a bit overwhelming to =
think about all of the projects we want to tackle but we are also committed=
 to taking our time and not rushing into anything without the necessary lea=
rning and planning.=C2=A0=C2=A0<u style=3D"font-family:sans-serif"></u><u s=
