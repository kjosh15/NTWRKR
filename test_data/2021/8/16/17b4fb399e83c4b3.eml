The perch platform is too small for the size of ravens we have, so I'll
have to build a bigger platform to sit on top of it. I'm guessing it'll
just be a matter of getting the right thickness of weather stripping, yeah?

Let's set up a time - I hope you're ok with it being a little far out as my
calendar is eating itself these days. Do any times here
<http://josh.is/scheduling> work for you?

All best,
Josh
