Hopefully not a time waster, but an interesting take on the farther-future
view of blockchain and personal data such as we collect.

My take is that the closer we are to having a centralized repository of
high-value individual data the more profitable our potential becomes, but
let me know what you think if you skim the below.

The Billion User Table
<https://content.1729.com/post/the-billion-user-table/>
By Jon Stokes =E2=80=93 23 Jul 2021 =E2=80=93 View online =E2=86=92

I'm a localist and an anti-monopolist, so I've been thinking for a few
years about the how's and why's of breaking up Big Tech via anti-monopoly
legislation. It's because I've been pondering the nuts-and-bolts mechanics
of how to break up Big Tech and then cap its size, that I've lately come to
realize that the entire *aaS application stack is about to get massively
disrupted in a very specific and under-appreciated way by the blockchain.

Every web-scale software player, from small B2B IaaS products to big
consumer-facing SaaS megaplatforms (Facebook, Google, Amazon), is about to
get its eggs scrambled.

*Here's what's coming*: the public blockchain amounts to a single, massive
*users* table for the entire Internet, and the next wave of distributed
applications will be built on top of it. This has all kinds of market and
political implications that I'm just now starting to get my head around.
Why the *users* table matters

As a society, we realized a long time ago that if we let banking go
entirely unregulated, then we end up with these mammoth, rickety entities
that lurch from crisis to crisis and drag us all down with them. So when we
set about putting regulatory limits on banks, we used a few simple,
difficult-to-game numbers that we could use as proxies for size and
systemic risk.

While there's still plenty of debate about what these numbers =E2=80=94 e.g=
., tier
1 capital ratio
<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-capital-ratio.asp>, total
assets, total revenues, etc. =E2=80=94 really tell us about a bank's overal=
l
systemic risk, the fact that we have some key numerical targets for
regulation is what once made it possible for us to limit Big Finance back
in the bygone era when we used to think it was important to do that.

What would an equivalent size number for a social network or other *aaS
product be? I think the answer is clearly the size of the platform's *users=
*
table.

Every web application, from the most embryonic MVP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product> all the way up to
Google, has a table called *users* (very few apps might give it a different
name) whose job it is to hold the information that lets users log into and
use the software =E2=80=94 email address or phone number and (encrypted) pa=
ssword
are the basic rows you'll find in this table, but you also find a ton more
proprietary data in there and in linked tables.

Here=E2=80=99s how important this one table is: If you went around the righ=
t
Silicon Valley neighborhood at 3 AM on a Tuesday morning knocking on doors
at random, every product owner you managed to stir from a deep slumber
could look at the clock and then immediately tell you the approximate size
of their *users* table at that moment. That's because the size of the
*users* table is the main number everyone in the software game lives and
dies by. Adding rows to your platform's *users* table is* how you win at
software.*

Even if your users are registering via a social sign-on button
<https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/08/social-login/> =E2=80=94 i.e., they sign=
 in with
Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. =E2=80=94 you've still got a *users* table w=
ith
information that lets you track users and market to them. In fact, let's
list some user-facing things you can do with your *users* table:

   - Record app-specific details, like transaction history, reputation
   markers (karma, badges earned, user ratings), social graph links, activi=
ty
   feeds, etc.
   - Support ticketing
   - Account recovery
   - Marketing and remarketing
   <https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453998?hl=3Den>

Then there are the business- and investor-facing things you can do with
this data, like sell ads, raise new investment, and so on.

The most critical thing your *users* table does for you, though, is it
gives you *access to network effects
<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp>*, and these
network effects give you some *lock-in*. The more users your platform has,
the more value it has to any one user (cf. Metcalfe's law
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law>), and the more value it
has to any one user, then A) the easier it is to attract new users, and B)
the harder it is for any one user to leave (because to leave is to give up
all that value).

So the *entire online attention economy* is built around proprietary *users=
*
tables that different apps jealously guard and are constantly trying to
grow.

This being the case, the size of this table is a direct measure of the size
of a tech platform. It's not a proxy measure, either. It's truly direct,
because it's literally the same number that the platforms are using
internally and that partners and investors are using externally.

If you wanted to cap the size of a platform, then, you'd do things to limit
the size of its *users* table.

So if I were trying to determine if a platform is big enough to warrant
regulatory intervention, I'd subpoena the integer result of this one query
and go from there:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

Similarly, if I were going to break up, say, Alphabet into Google and
YouTube components, I'd make the two companies maintain totally separate
users tables. I'd then forbid these two entities from accessing each
other's user data via non-public interfaces, so that if YouTube wants to
host Google users then it has to enable social logins for Google just like
every other service.
What it means that everyone has a separate *users* table

In the present incarnation of the web, all these separate *users* tables
enforce a specific kind of interoperability architecture even on apps that
want to be fairly open with their own user data. Specifically, everyone's
proprietary user data sits behind an API that any third-party app has to
call if it wants access.

The result is a decentralized network of siloed tables connected by
access-controlled APIs. Depending on the relationship between any two nodes
in that network, they=E2=80=99ll have different kinds of access to each oth=
ers=E2=80=99
data through this ad-hoc, decentralized system.

For a practical look at what this means, let's take the example of LinkedIn
<https://linkedin.com/>. If I have endorsements for JavaScript and
WordPress, and I register with your new website via a LinkedIn button, your
site isn't automatically going to know that I have these endorsements. In
order for me to learn about your LinkedIn endorsements, I have to hit a
LinkedIn-hosted API to get that information. (I=E2=80=99m not sure if Linke=
dIn
actually exposes this data via API, but that=E2=80=99s beside the point.)

This arrangement has a few key implications:

   - I can only access the user data that *LinkedIn elects to publish* via
   its API.
   - LinkedIn can *revoke API access* for any data at any time, so it's not
   safe for me to build a business that's premised on access to, say, Linke=
dIn
   endorsement data.
   - It's also not safe for me to *anger LinkedIn* if I do go ahead and
   develop a critical dependence on their endorsement data, because they ma=
y
   just revoke *my* access to that data while leaving my competitors alone.
   - If something bad happens to LinkedIn, like maybe Google buys them and
   then *closes them down* in typical Google fashion, then that API and all
   the endorsements behind it are gone.
   - I will never be able to *write my own endorsements* to LinkedIn=E2=80=
=99s
   tables for others to see unless Linked gives me write access to that tab=
le.
   And again, if it does then I can still lose that access because it was
   revoked (for everyone or just for me) or because LinkedIn is gone.

The bottom line of the above points is: LinkedIn=E2=80=99s ongoing control =
of its
proprietary endorsement data gives that company *leverage* over all users
of that data, and it gives all users of that data *exposure* to various
LinkedIn-specific business risks.

This combination of *leverage* *and* *risk exposure* massively constrains
every entrepreneur's ability to build their applications in ways that
depend on data LinkedIn is curating.

More generally speaking, the pervasive leverage/risk dynamics that swirl
around the *users* tables of the tech megaplatforms are the *dark matter*
that gives shape to all the visible aspects of the Internet as we currently
experience it.

When that dark matter disappears, everything is going to fly apart.
The blockchain as the Internet's *users* table

I don't want to get into a bunch of detail on how the blockchain can use
public key cryptography to form what is, in effect, a public *users* table
that operates at Internet scale. But not only is this possible, it's
already being done. Maybe in a later post I can drill down on this.

In place of a decentralized network of user data silos connected by APIs,
there=E2=80=99s a single decentralized user data store accessible via an op=
en
protocol and a decentralized network of storage nodes. So the
identity-hosting blockchain represents decentralization at the datastore
implementation layer, and recentralization at the datastore access layer.

I=E2=80=99ll use BitClout <https://bitclout.com/>=E2=80=99s blockchain as a=
n example of
what I'm talking about because I=E2=80=99ve been thinking about it a lot la=
tely for
various reasons. But I could use others, as well.

So with BitClout, I have an identity <https://bitclout.com/u/jonstokes> on
that blockchain that's publicly accessible to anyone running an open-source
BitClout node. To continue with the example of LinkedIn, if they were to
rebuild themselves on top of BitClout, and they were to write their entire
users table along with all its endorsements to the BitClout blockchain,
then that data would be there for every other BitClout node to read or
append to.

If anything were to happen to LinkedIn or to its internal assessment of the
value of providing public endorsement data on-chain, the public would still
have unfettered, permanent access to the old data. Furthermore, I could
easily stand up a service that lets BitClout users (who are also LinkedIn
users now) continue to endorse each other for various skills under my own
identity, and I could even add a new skill and endorsement options that
others could recognize (or ignore) alongside LinkedIn's.

Sure, LinkedIn could continue to keep its endorsement data off-chain behind
a proprietary API even if its *users* table was effectively the BitClout
blockchain. But a decision to keep data siloed this way is a decision to
forego on-chain network effects for that data. My guess is that the
temptation to take advantage of blockchain-sized network effects will be so
great, that *companies will default to putting data on-chain* rather than
keeping it siloed.

This point about network effects is why people will build things using
on-chain identities. It's so critical that I'm going to blockquote what I
just wrote about network effects above, so you can read it again:

The most critical thing your *users* table does for you, though, is it
gives you access to network effects
<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp>, and these
network effects give you some lock-in. The more users your platform has,
the more value it has to any one user (cf. Metcalfe's law
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law>), and the more value it
has to any one user, then A) the easier it is to attract new users, and B)
the harder it is for any one user to leave (because to leave is to give up
all that value).

Imagine that LinkedIn, Reddit, and Github all port their *users* tables
(along with much of their proprietary data, like endorsements, karma, and
activity history) to BitClout. Immediately, here's what happens: every
Github user is *also* a Reddit user and a LinkedIn user and a BitClout
user. Likewise, every Reddit user is *also* a Github user and a LinkedIn
user and a BitClout user. I could go on, but you get the point.

Every company that builds on the same virtual *users* table has immediate
access to the network effects of every other startup on that table. Every
time an on-chain company onboards a new user, then your service has a new
user, as well. (In a manner of speaking. They may not be actively using
your service yet, but they effectively have an account on it.)

Conversely, *users*-table-based network effects cease being an economic moa=
t
<https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp> that can
give anyone any kind of defensible or investable edge.

The game theory of this arrangement is as follows:

   1. All of the big incumbents will want to keep their *users* tables
   proprietary in the beginning, because that's their moat and it gives the=
m
   the network effects and lock-in that markets and investors reward them f=
or.
   2. At some point, though, the blockchain *users* table (plus the
   ecosystem built on it) will grow to the size where incumbents can't comp=
ete
   on their own. When BitClout's virtual *users* table has surpassed, say,
   Twitter's proprietary *users* table in size, then Twitter will either
   join the blockchain or get left behind. And likewise on up the size
   leaderboards until we get to Google and Facebook.
   3. Eventually, there will be a blockchain *users* table that's bigger
   than the next two or three proprietary users tables combined. When that
   happens, the megaplatforms will either ditch their proprietary tables an=
d
   reconfigure their businesses around the chain, or they'll enter a doom l=
oop.

Imagine a world where every startup begins life with as many users as the
largest incumbent. There's no on-boarding or sign-up friction =E2=80=94 at =
least
friction isn=E2=80=99t mandatory as it is now (you *could* reintroduce it).=
 If
you're built on the big identity blockchain, then every blockchain wallet
is already a (inactive) user of your service who has a seamless way to
transact with you for money and digital goods.

It will cost companies some money to reach their users and flip them from
inactive to active for their particular service. I think there will
definitely be paid inboxes on any chain that's going to survive because
otherwise SPAM will make the whole thing unusable. But companies can query
the chain, identify a subset of users to target, and then target them or
service them in whatever way they can afford.

If you want to build a set of network effects that benefit your company
specifically, it won't be enough to simply cultivate a large *users* table
or email list =E2=80=94 no, you'll have to offer something on-chain that ot=
hers are
also incentivized to use, so that the thing you're uniquely offering
spreads and becomes a kind of currency.

For example, if I'm the only one offering a particular credential (e.g.,
user verification, like Twitter Verified but on-chain), then the more users
employ that credential in their transactions the larger my on-chain network
is.

How would I, the credential provider get value from this? I dunno, but it's
not too hard to come up with random possibilities. For instance, if you
accept my credential then maybe you have to accept marketing messages from
me at some steep discount to your normal inbox rate; I can either use this
discounted access directly or resell it. That's one example I just randomly
thought up, and I'm just one dude =E2=80=94 I'm sure the market will come u=
p with a
lot more.

*The bottom line*: Moving identity on-chain, and thereby removing the
possibility of *users*-table-centric network effects, completely up-ends
the entire landscape of API-based, access-controlled interoperability that
the present Internet is built on. All of the non-technical market and
political dynamics around *users* table size, leverage, and risk suddenly
go out the window.

I don't know what the results will look like, but I'm pretty sure it will
be unrecognizable to us right now. There are whole conversations we're
currently having around tech consolidation and censorship that won't even
make sense in a single-*users*-table world.

To put it another way, there=E2=80=99s now another large, growing entity on=
 the
scene in addition to the government that can face off against Big Tech and
break it up by force. Of course, the government may try to murder that
entity before it not only gets big enough to do in Big Tech, but then it
turns its monopoly-busting powers on the government itself.

rgin:0 0 1.5em 0;line-height:1.6em">For a practical look at what this means=

color:#08121a;text-decoration:underline" target=3D"_blank">LinkedIn</a>. If=
 I have endorsements for JavaScript and WordPress, and I register with your=
 new website via a LinkedIn button, your site isn&#39;t automatically going=
 to know that I have these endorsements. In order for me to learn about you=
r LinkedIn endorsements, I have to hit a LinkedIn-hosted API to get that in=
formation. (I=E2=80=99m not sure if LinkedIn actually exposes this data via=
 API, but that=E2=80=99s beside the point.)</p><p style=3D"margin:0 0 1.5em=

 I do go ahead and develop a critical dependence on their endorsement data,=
 because they may just revoke <em>my</em> access to that data while leaving=
 my competitors alone.</li><li style=3D"margin:0.5em 0;padding-left:0.3em;l=
ine-height:1.6em">If something bad happens to LinkedIn, like maybe Google b=
uys them and then <strong style=3D"font-weight:700">closes them down</stron=

 it are gone.</li><li style=3D"margin:0.5em 0;padding-left:0.3em;line-heigh=

 for me) or because LinkedIn is gone.</li></ul><p style=3D"margin:0 0 1.5em=
