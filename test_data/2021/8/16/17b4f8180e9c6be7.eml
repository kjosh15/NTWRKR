<br>
Thanks for your questions regarding the happiness course I took.=C2=A0 Asid=
e from giving you some info I rediscovered some things I wanted to work on.=
=C2=A0 If you=E2=80=99re interested there are also some TED talk references=
 I can give you.=C2=A0 <br>
<br>
So, you should be happy to know one of your ideas is repeated in this cours=
e, that is:<br>
Invest in experiences not stuff.<br>
<br>
Another idea, write in a diary 5 positive things that occur in your life da=
ily.<br>
<br>
And, in regard to the wishes-wants you have in your life,<br>
1.=C2=A0 Put in 3 to 4 words your wish, prominently displayed where you are=
 reminded of it.<br>
2. Imagine the best outcome of your wish - what stops you from you from ach=
ieving it.<br>
3. Imagine the obstacle and how to overcome it.<br>
<br>
I was surprised and encouraged by the division of things that effect our ha=
ppiness.<br>
50% genetic<br>
40% actions under our control<br>
10% life circumstances<br>
<br>
Hope you find this interesting and hopefully helpful.<br>
<br>
Love you kiddo!<br>
