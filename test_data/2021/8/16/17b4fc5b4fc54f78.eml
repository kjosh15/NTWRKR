Hey Barri! Glad to hear things are starting to settle in. Life here is
going the opposite direction; the kids are about to start school, so is
Hulda, we're moving back into the farmhouse, my business is starting to
pick up, and our car just died... so no time even for showers!

That said, you=E2=80=99re right - winter is coming, again. But maybe this w=
inter
can be about being cozy and reflective, about giving space to grow in
safety, and about enjoying where we are while we=E2=80=99re in it.

That=E2=80=99s my thought for the day, anyway! Let=E2=80=99s touch base in =
a couple weeks
to see if we can=E2=80=99t set up a more regular thread!

Xoxo,
Josh
