Wanted to follow up as I have an example of someone I definitely
unsubscribed and who then received another follow up message from me;
swart.richard@gmail.com. My campaign titled "#11 - 15/07/21" sent the
initial email, and he's been getting followups from me automatically
despite. Really embarrassing; do you know what happened?

Thanks!
Josh
