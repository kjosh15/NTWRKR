   - Video: Phase 2 - Jays learn to open the box 
   <https://youtu.be/wH32XSGvJDc>
   - Video: Phase 2 - montage of Jays throughout the day 
   <https://youtu.be/fOC2epRcPOY>

Yesterday morning the Stellar's Jays were very active and talking a lot.  
The box was on the roof in Phase 1, but it only had cheetos and no 
peanuts.  So I decided to test out Phase 2 with the Jays.  I added peanuts 
and switched the box to Phase 2.  Over the next hour, the two Jays would 
land on the box, get scared when it opened, and fly off. One of the Jays 
started to understand what was going on.  He/she would land, open it, fly 
to the rail, wait a second, then fly back down to the box while it was 
still open and take a peanut.  After a few times doing this, he/she then 
became comfortable with landing on the box and staying while it opened.  
He/she had definitely learned what was going on. It took the other Jay a 
few more hours to learn, and I'm still not sure the second Jay has 
completely learned how it works. 

When the peanuts are gone, the fast-learner Jay will continue to come back, 
open the box, and then peck at the box.  It's like he/she is mad because 
there aren't anymore peanuts, only cheetos.  The Jays will continue to come 
back every hour or so and check to see if more peanuts have appeared.  They 
seem to be able to differentiate the peanuts from the cheetos by sight 
because they will look in the basket window and then fly off.

I filled the basket 4 times throughout the day yesterday with peanuts 
because it was so fun and fascinating to watch them learn how the box 
worked.

The crows on the other hand haven't been around for the last 48 hours.  
They are spooked by the whole thing.  As I was filling the box and changing 
the logic yesterday morning, one crow sat on the neighbor's roof and 
watched me the whole time.  He/she didn't yell at me, just quietly watched 
me.  But after that, I haven't seen a crow.  We thought they might come 
back last night (they normally show up in the mornings and then after 
4:30PM) so I put cheetos out on the floor next to the box and filled the 
basket with more peanuts.  The hope was that the cheetos would attract the 
crows and then they would see the Jays getting the peanuts from the box and 
learn.  But as I mentioned, the crows didn't show up.

So now I don't know whether to focus on progressing with the Jays or back 
up to Phase 1 and try to get the crows back by removing the box and feeding 
on the floor again.  I"m having so much fun watching the Jays I will 
probably leave the box out and potentially test Phase 3 with the Jays after 
a couple of more days while continuing to put cheetos on the floor and 
around the roof for the crows in hopes they return.
