Smari had a good (and underreported) take on infection rates here, which is
that none of the public stats take into account that most of the recent
wave occurred in the initial window before the second shot finished
producing full immunity. I.e., the numbers may shortly fall precipitously
as full immunity manifests in the broader population.

Or maybe not; who knows. Still, it=E2=80=99s interesting to hear =E2=80=9Ch=
erd immunity=E2=80=9D
discussed again. As ever, it seems like we=E2=80=99re in the best possible =
place.

Xoxo,
Josh
