The jackdaw sometimes arrives. This morning the jackdaw was, interacted
with 3rd stage. Magpies arrive every day, I myself saw how they threw coins
into the coin receiver, but they didn't do *it in the *video.
I hope to reach stage 4 this summer. Have you reached stage  4? I just
haven't seen any videos of trained crows.(if yes, please send a video, I
really want to watch it).
How will the new box differ from the old one?
