Sweets,

Got both boy's phones set up, and their laptop accounts are almost finished
(Haakon doesn't have a gmail account yet, which means Drops isn't set up
either). A few questions remain to be answered - can you help me think
through this?

- setup Google voice for O/H?
- setup Google photos for O/H? (Can we family plan this?)
- what weekly meal plan app would work best for us all?

Finally, we need to either buy the Vodafone Nokia or find a cheap flip
phone from a family member for Othinn. Do you mind asking about the latter
just to check before we buy a new (old) Nokia?

xoxo,
Josh

P.S. Here are the apps we could NOT install on Haakon's phone (I'm asking
Devon, the Tutus, and my folks if they know anyone with an old iPhone 6 or
newer in a drawer somewhere so we can use parental controls and install
these apps for him!)
