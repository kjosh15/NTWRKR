Hi Josh,

Great to hear from you and I'm glad to hear you've been busy with
interesting work. I am well but busy dealing with planning 2022 and many
changes to manage now into then. I don't have anything for us to work on at
the moment but will keep you in mind of course. Take care and thanks again
for reaching out. Best,

/te
