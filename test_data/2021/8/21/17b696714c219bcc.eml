Joshua,

Quirks in a U.S. Treaty With Malta Turn Into a TaHave you heard of Malta Pen=
sion Plans? They=E2=80=99re offshore tax shelters that are hot with some wea=
lthy Americans.

As usual with tax shelters, the promoters promise they=E2=80=99ll slash tax b=
ills by making clever use of legal quirks. That puts them in a somewhat gray=
 area, meaning the tax savings could bring legal risks.

Malta has caught the attention of advisers due to quirks in a 2011 tax treat=

roads in the Mediterranean Sea.=20

Predictably, Malta pensions have also caught the eye of the Internal Revenue=
 Service. In July, the agency put them on its =E2=80=9CDirty Dozen=E2=80=9D l=

California attorney and Malta-plan advocate Jeffrey Verdon has posted a YouT=
ube video extolling these strategies as a =E2=80=9Cunique opportunity=E2=80=9D=
 for high-income taxpayers. The video says these pensions are like =E2=80=9C=
