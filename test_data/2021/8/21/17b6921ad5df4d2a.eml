Bayo Akomolafe - Change Your Story, Change The World
ManTalks Podcast

Easily one of my favorite conversations this year. The depth of Bayo Akomola=
fe's wisdom is pretty much limitless. Listen in and be blown away. Bayo and I=
 cover a lot of ground here, digging into the importance of ritual, the role=
 of stories in our growth and how those stories are influenced by what's aro=
und us, the "atmosphere" of trauma, the microbiome, cripestimology, and look=
ing for (as he calls it) the cracks in human agency. Dr. Bayo Akomolafe is a=
 globally acclaimed lecturer, speaker, and proud diaper-changer, and conside=
rs his most sacred work to be learning how to be with his daughter, his son,=
 and his wife Ijeoma.  =E2=80=9CTo learn the importance of insignificance=E2=
=80=9D is the way he frames a desire to reacquaint himself with a world that=
 is irretrievably entangled, preposterously alive, and completely partial. A=
fter losing his diplomat father to a sudden heart complication, Bayo became a=
 reclusive teenager, seeking to get to the =E2=80=9Cheart of the matter=E2=80=
=9D as a response to his painful loss. He sought to apply himself to the ext=
remes of his social conditioning, his faith, and his eventual training as a c=
linical psychologist, graduating summa cum laude from Covenant University in=
 Nigeria. Largely nurtured and trained in a world that increasingly fell sho=
rt of his deepest desires for justice, Bayo=E2=80=99s doctoral research invo=
lved meeting with traditional healers as part of his quest to understand tra=
uma, mental wellbeing, and healing in new ways.  His deep questions and conc=
erns for decolonized landscapes has congealed into a life devoted to explori=
ng the nuances of a =E2=80=9Cmagical=E2=80=9D world =E2=80=9Ctoo promiscuous=
