Oh jeeeezus, these must have gotten caught up in an unfortunate filter and
I'm just seeing them now. I'm REALLY sorry Josh - didn't mean to blow you
off, and super jealous of your Iceland view. We've made a couple of quick
pit stops in Rejkyavik (totally butchered that spelling) but getting out of
town and exploring more has been on our list for a while.

I know you saw I've left Save the Children and am in law school. What I
haven't mentioned is I'm going back to travel industry consulting for TCS
(Tata Consulting - yes, the giant firm based in India). I start that next
week. Might be interesting, we'll see. If you'd still like to catch up once
I get my feet wet in there to see if there's anything cool to chat about,
I'd love that.

Meanwhile, about to step into 8 hours of a class on Property. G-d help us
all...

Hope you're doing well,
Charlie
