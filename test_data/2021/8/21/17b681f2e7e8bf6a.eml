Christ. I packed the box surrounded by clothing, then a foam pad one and
several rolls of socks. I don't know what they did to it in shipping but it
wasn't gentle...

Anyway, two follow up questions. For sci-grip, can I assume that this

will work? (I may get it shipped along with some other materials later this
month.) And for the adaptor, I have these
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FJWLLDB/ref=3Dppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin=
_title?ie=3DUTF8&psc=3D1>
and these
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058EG0KC/ref=3Dox_sc_act_title_5?smid=
=3DALEWIQ2F9CQDR&psc=3D1>
but am not clear on if they'll convert what I have. I recognize I'm abusing
your availability here, but I don't want to try it and be wrong...!

How are things otherwise, BTW? We're getting settled into the farm here,
which is (after two months of living in an RV) really grounding. It's been
a wild ride these last 18 months so knowing where I'll be living for the
next 9 feels luxurious... esp. in terms of being able to advance some RL
projects like the crowbox!! Are things settling down on your end?

All best,
Josh
