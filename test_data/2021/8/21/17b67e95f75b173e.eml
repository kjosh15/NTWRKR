My perception of the core issues at this time in history are the meta-compl=

<br>
My vision is that of a DAO in which your betting track record over time giv=
es you more influence on the signal of truth or falsity for any given claim=
 in the system. All activity has cost or risk associated with it for the in=
dividuals, and it has significant financial reward possible. You can bet on=
 your own truth claims, other people=E2=80=99s claims or individuals themse=
