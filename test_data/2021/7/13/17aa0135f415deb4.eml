Claire,

Can you let me know if it'll be possible to get some info on proximity
prior to putting a proposal in front of you? Best case is email proximity
(anonymized Exchange data is fine, as an example), but depending on the
overlap we'd want to suggest different approaches to deployment.

All best,
Josh
