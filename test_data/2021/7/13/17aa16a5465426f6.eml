Dear Friends and Family,



We are enjoying the long days of summer here in Ireland.  This past month
has been eventful and incredibly busy. This is the way life seems to work,
in fits and spurts.  We had a relaxing and rejuvenating 20th Anniversary
trip to Achill Island, we celebrated from a distance my parent's 50th
Anniversary.  Pierce had a birthday and he and Hannah bought their first
home.  We are both now fully vaccinated and my parents are finally able to
visit! Oh yeah, and our house sale finally went through!!!!!



The Great Western Greenway



Eric and I started our anniversary trip at a nice hotel in Wesport.  For
the first time since December,  we were able to experience a restaurant
meal inside. Hotels are the only place in Ireland where you can eat inside
currently.  We had a lovely walk around the town and enjoyed the hotel
amenities including a swim in the pool for me and the wonderful innovation
of the Japanese toilet.  The next day we hopped on our bikes and rode the
greenway to Achill.  It was a windy trip but beautiful and we shared the
trail with several sheep including some adorable baby lambs.  The weekend
was rainy but we managed some nice walks and several games of crazy
eights.  Our ride back started of rough, the first 9 km had rain and a
pretty strong side wind but as we reached the summit near Mullaranny the
weather cleared and we had a nice leisurely bike ride back to Westport.



Pinky and Susie come to Visit



For the first time since we moved here, we finally have company! My parents
arrived at the end of June braving the international restrictions and
requirements, just in time to help us move into our new house! We had some
overlap time with the apartment so for the first week of their visit, I
stayed with them in Dublin while Eric worked from the new place and
received deliveries.  We were great tourists and visited St. Stephens Green
and Grafton Street,  the zoo and the botanical gardens, the Archeology
Museum,  the Dublinia and Christ Church.  I drug them around on the city
bus and we took a nice walk around Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey.   Eric joined
us on Friday and we headed up to our New home.  Susie and Pinky were super
helpful getting us settled. Dad spackled and sanded and mom figured out our
washing machine.  We even managed some sightseeing when we were not putting
them to work! We had a fantastic tour of the Hill of Uisneach
<https://uisneach.ie/> and admired the telescope at Birr Castle
<https://birrcastle.com/>.  Yesterday we went to Howth for the Frogs to
Bogs loop and Susie had an encounter with a very aggressive seagull who
stole half her scone as she was attempting to eat it.  Last night was our
last night in the apartment and today mom and dad headed off to Tralee to
begin their walking tour of the Dingle Peninsula,  we will be joining them
on Friday in Dingle.



The House



After seven long months of waiting for all the t's to be crossed and i's
dotted, we finally closed on our house!  We now live just a wee bit west of
the geographical center of Ireland! Moving our stuff from the apartment was
the easy part. Eric has some wonderful friends from work that helped us
move and we were able to get most of the stuff moved in one trip. We did
not move to Ireland with many material possessions and managed to not add
too many new items in our time here. Of course that means that now that we
have a house, there are many things we need.  Deliveries are arriving at a
steady pace and we now have actual beds in 2 of the rooms, for the record
they are much more comfortable than air mattresses! We have managed to meet
most of our immediate neighbours and are feeling really welcome here. I was
invited by one neighbor to join a group that swims in the lake (Lough Ree)
every weekend! We were even invited to our neighbor Paddy's for tea and the
England vs. Italy game on Sunday.  This house is a project rich
environment,  there is so much to do and we have so much land! Paddy was
also kind enough to harvest the silage in our paddocks which we will get
paid for and we will let his cows graze the edges and one of our paddocks
that was too steep to harvest.   I am looking into taking some courses on
beekeeping.  Eric is anxious to start an orchard.  It is a bit overwhelming
to think about all of the projects we want to tackle but we are also
committed to taking our time and not rushing into anything without the
necessary learning and planning.
