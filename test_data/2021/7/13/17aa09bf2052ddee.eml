Unfortunately, the new device is still at the assembly stage. But I have a
3d model of it (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oelHshGw8ANuFDOQRm5b_JJiBFJe5OqZ/view?usp=
=3Ddrivesdk
) . The crow should take the peanuts from the upper compartment, and throw
the cigarette butt into the place between the table and the wall of the
device. And then the cigarette butt passes identification and falls either
into the garbage or into the compartment with cigarette butts.
Here is a video of the third stage  (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/191w-rBLE7-6w7fTH2Ke29VdTBymQCEJL/view?usp=
=3Ddrivesdk
). The jackdaw throws coins into the coin receiver. I think she understands
that the coins need to be specially thrown off and she takes them with her
beak. I put a couple of coins on the top cover so that the jackdaw starts
taking a coin from there, but so far she does not want to.
I don't have my own documentation on the neural network, but I thought
about creating it, I made this network based on the documentation on
GitHub. If you want, I can send a link.
I don't know how you can help me yet. The Jackdaw does not arrive, and I do
not know why. Perhaps you have some ideas?
I read about indigometrics when I read about you on Wikipedia. It was
written there that you are the founder of indigometrics. I decided to read
about your idea, and I really liked it, and I'm glad that you work with
such large companies. 30k employees is a lot.

Thanks for the update! Would love to see footage of your setup, the crow in
action, etc. And the neural network also sounds super interesting; do you
have documentation up somewhere? Excited to hear about your successes; how
can we help?

indigometrics is a very fun project; we're working with several large
multionationals (>30k employees) and it works quite well. Where did you
hear about this before?

All best,
Josh
