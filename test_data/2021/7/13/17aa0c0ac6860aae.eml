Hi Josh
It=E2=80=99s been quite a while indeed since our last contact.  Since our la=
st contact, the world has changed significantly; it appears it=E2=80=99d not=
 be back to normal any time soon.  We in Malaysia are still on full lockdown=
 with an ever increasing number of new Covid cases.
I=E2=80=99ve sent you an invite in LinkedIn; that might be a better way to k=
eep in touch.
Best regards
Paul
