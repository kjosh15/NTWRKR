Great! Thanks for the heads up; looking forward to catching up on your
latest projects!

Summer so far has been a paradise for the kids; we're in an RV following
the good weather (currently in the east). Let us know if you come up to
Akureyri, it would be wonderful to see you!

I've cc'd Hulda to circle around on August plans.
