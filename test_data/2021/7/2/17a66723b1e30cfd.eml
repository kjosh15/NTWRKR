*TL;DR: How do you confirm that your startups' corporate paperwork is in
order before you have sudden demand and need to countenance a sale?*

Indigometrics has been running fast since the beginning, and I have
enormous trust and respect for my cofounder. OTOH, I know that trust and
contracts are not equivalent, and that it pays to have your paperwork in
place.

What is required to make sure both partners are protected and all legal
coverage is in place before investment or M&A activity begins? I expect we
have everything already, but want to confirm and (if necessary) get an
outside opinion before things heat up any further.

What do you advise?

Very much obliged!

Josh

P.S. I'm heading to NYC July 16th for a week. Is there anyone there I
should meet?
