Of course!! Also I messed up and I think this rental we have in Cape Cod is
Saturday to Saturday, so we won't be able to be around on the 17th.  But I
bet at least Patrick can see you on the 16th?? We will be figuring this
out!!  The house has no other visitors besides you, no problem in the least
for the 15th!
