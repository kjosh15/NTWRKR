Joshua,

We are more than well. It has cooled here - for the moment - only in the 80s=
. On the way here, Tuesday, we stopped for lunch and ate outside in a strong=
 breeze - at 110 F (43+ C). That was more than =E2=80=9Cwarm=E2=80=9D. That e=
vening we had to go to 6 or 8 restaurants to find one open; their air condit=
ioning couldn=E2=80=99t keep up, so many were closed.=20

How warm was it there to be shorts weather?

We have been having a lot of fun together (more than usual, it seems) since o=
ur trip to Iceland. Your mother is deep into her art and an absorbing book a=
t night. Fishing is treating me well thus far.=20

Have you been able to establish a work routine from the RV?

Love,
DAD
