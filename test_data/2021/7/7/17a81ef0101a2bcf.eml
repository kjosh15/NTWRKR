Thanks so much, Phillip! You may say "if there's a next time" now, but just
wait until the pain has faded from your memory...

An ideal partner is one who will sign a single agreement for exclusive
licensing rights in exchange for a mix of investment and % of proceeds, as
well as a chance to repeat the trial for other categories. Extra points if
they can turn these insights into products at scale and can quickly
activate a very large cohort for the trial.

At its heart, the proposition here is that we can run a scaled trial to
quickly figure out what design elements will turn new data types into
behavior change in end users. That's pretty powerful when you look at the
broad assortment of new medical sensor tech coming out now; there's lots of
potential players who could benefit but I'd expect a J&J, Novo Nordisk, or
similar would be the place to start.

Before any of that, though, is there a more formal opportunity for W50
here? I'm flattered (and interested!) in any introductions you think are
useful, but am also really grateful to W50 and would love to see them pull
off another Nike+Apple style agreement. I know W50 is changing a lot these
days - is that a conversation worth having, or should I just shut my mouth
and gladly accept an introduction or two?

Also, Sabbatical? Is this book recovery?

Thanks again,
Josh
