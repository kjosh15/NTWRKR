I'll keep looking, but I think you're right - everyone knows this is a
critical space, but nobody knows how/why/what yet. Hopefully we get to
answer that question with our product first...

We're at least getting in the room - I have conversations coming up w/
KPMG, Bain, EY, Accenture, McKinsey, Blackstone, and Blackrock to hopefully
help solve our customer service/engagement issues and provide inbound.
Finger's crossed.

X2 looks super interesting; I'd love to talk to the founder if he thinks
it'd be interesting! Is there anything I can do to help with any of
your othe ventures in the meantime?
