I connected with Tinisha today - she's awesome!! I've had the opportunity
to speak with a number of folks in her role in other organizations and she
was the first to be super direct about her work and the opportunity. SO
REFRESHING.

My takeaway was that there may be an opportunity to pilot on her content
with your organization if it's extensible to the rest of the organization.
Exciting prospects! We're scheduling a followup so I can demo the platform
to her now.

Enjoy Boston, and thanks so much for making this happen!

All best,
Josh
