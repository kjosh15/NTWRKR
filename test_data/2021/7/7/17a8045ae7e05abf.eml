FUCKING BRILLIANT. This is amazing work; I love this!!!

Also, the timing couldn't possibly be better; I'm in touch with the CMO of
Icelandair and just got last-minute tickets to NYC - next week!! Want to
have me record the VO on my mic setup here beforehand and we can do the
on-screen bits in person? Then we can flesh out the rest of the materials
in person and add to anything you think needs adding.

I could make time the 18th, 19th, 20th, or 21st - are any of those remotely
possible?

Hugely stoked,
Josh
