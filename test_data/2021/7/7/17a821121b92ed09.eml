Sounds good! Lunch might work well (depending on the jet lag), or it looks
like I might be free the evening of the 20th. If you can be flexible that'd
be a great help - I'm trying to juggle some business engagements and
everyone is messing me around. Looking forward to seeing you all again!!!

All best,
Josh
