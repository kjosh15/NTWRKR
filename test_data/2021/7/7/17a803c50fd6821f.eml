Thanks so much, Anne!!

Cameron, Kate, pleasure to meet you. Are you available for a brief call
sometime in the next couple weeks? Alternately, I'll be in NYC from the
16th-21st if you'd like to meet in person.

Sincerely,
Josh

Thanks again for meeting the other day - really appreciate you making the t=
ime! You&#39;d asked for a short summary of the microtargeting pitch to flo=
at by:<br>
<br>
<div>a) your real estate research team (for a reality check), as well as <b=
r>
b) the general marketing team to see if it could be applied more broadly. <=
br>
<br>
Please find a short description below, and let me know if I can ever return=
 the favor!!<br>
<br>
&quot;By using online, purchasable data to focus on depth over breadth, we =
propose using several disparate technologies to hyper target small numbers =
of specific decision makers prior to final close on high value deals. Super=
cookies, heavily screened organic, and
 geolocative marketing techniques will be used to deliver authentic content=
. By creating an inverse social graph we can also target the influencers wh=
o help shape the decision maker&#39;s opinions.<br>
<br>
The overall goal is to quietly and effectively produce background impressio=
ns over 1-3 months to shift these individual&#39;s view of high-value asset=
s just prior to a sale or purchase. This would be an exclusive, private ser=
vice designed to create significant
 (&gt;1%) improvements in overall return on assets while also supporting ra=
pidly increasing scope and scale.&quot;<br>
<br>
Enjoy the lack of travel,<br>
Josh<br>

<div>Thanks so much! Reg. Iceland, my biggest tip is to follow the weather =
- it changes continually and often, and it&#39;s worth going to where it&#3=

circles, as locals are very approachable
