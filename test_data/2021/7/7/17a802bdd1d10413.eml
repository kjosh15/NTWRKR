How goes the book selling world? I've been really enjoying your missives -
believe me, I'm taking notes!

I've got a venture I need your take on as it involves W50. Not sure if you
recall, but a few years ago I was diagnosed as diabetic. Long story short,
I reversed it by using the same Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices
which were (ironically) causing my blood sugar to spike in the first place.

Now I want to use that experience to launch a large-scale trial
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit#slide=3Did.g94ec82ae12_0_281>
to determine how to help anybody avoid diabetes, obesity, and heart disease
(all lifestyle diseases for which spiking glucose is a predicate.) I've got
the right partners, software, and procedures and now I need a large
corporate partner who can sponsor the trial and license the results to make
real, world-changing products at scale.

I know World 50 was instrumental in making the Nike + Apple partnership
happen. I'd like to set this up as another example of that, instead of just
contacting target companies myself.

Am I smoking crack here, or is this the sort of thing W50 would like to
help with?

All best,
Josh
