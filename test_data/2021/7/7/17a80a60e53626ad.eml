yooooo. Good morning. The book is...okay. I think it's gone well but it's
had a little post-launch lull (to be expected). The big issue now is
getting people to write reviews. Next time around, I am going to write 200
of them, put them in a google doc, and give people the link. Tell them to
cut and paste. Well, who knows if there is a next time....

I did not know about your diagnosis and experience with diabetes. I am
sorry you've been through it, and not at all surprised you've been able to
do such amazing things. Any relationship I have is yours. Do you have a
sense for the ideal partner? Is it Novo Nordisk, for example? Who within a
company? I know a few people here and there, as, I am sure, do some of my
colleagues.

I logged into my email this morning as one last check before sabbatical.
I've CCed my personal email. I would like to keep the thread going. When
you reply to this, drop W50 email off and we will continue "over there."
Thanks Josh.
