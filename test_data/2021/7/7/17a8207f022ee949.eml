Honestly I could use some more political connections. =C3=8Dslandsstofa has=
 been
great, but I haven't seen them deliver anything yet. Building some bridges
for long-term exchanges could be helpful; I'm working on pushing the
Icelandic education system, bringing in outside investors around
sustainability initiatives, and finding myself innovation-oriented tax
breaks (particularly around capital gains) if any of those cause someone to
spring to mind!

Gratefully,
Josh
