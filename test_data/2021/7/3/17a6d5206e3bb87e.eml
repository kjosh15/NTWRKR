Josh,

Thank you for your patience.

At this time we have reviewed your indigometrics.com site and can confirm that the zone file from the requested service has been moved. And the SSL for indigometrics.com has been installed to your cPanel service. Please keep in mind your DNS zone file was moved as is and it may be required to update any custom DNS records, or point your parent domain, indigometrics.com's records to the new service.

As of now, it looks like the IP address located in the zone file for the domain still points to the IP 64.13.192.163, which may be for you old service. That IP entry should point to 208.109.70.73, which is the IP for your cPanel service. We did not make any changes in case the current setting was intentional. Please let us know if you would like assistance with correcting the old information contained in the zone file.

If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this support request, or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for continuing to use (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Demetrius R.
Customer Support Lead @ (mt) Media Temple
