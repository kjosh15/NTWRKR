tered
> around finding and working with founders to establish a deal pipeline and
> community, establishing deal screening & diligence processes, networking =
in
> the space, and fundraising for Pronomos & our portfolio companies.
>
> We also viewed 2020 as a year of exploration, and much of our time this
> year has been spent digesting the lessons and deciding how best to advanc=
e
> the fund and the charter cities movement. We will be putting out content
> later this year with our views, but roughly we view ourselves as a sector
> catalyst, helping transition the startup cities industry from dreaming to
> doing. Currently, too many projects suffer from inexperience
> (understandable in a new sector), and it=E2=80=99s our role as the only
> cross-project investment fund to learn, write, and share so that everyone
> can learn faster together.
>
> Another key part of the message we need to get to founders is that
> building a startup city is doable today. It=E2=80=99s no longer a cool di=
stant idea
> for the future. If you=E2=80=99re an operationally-oriented entrepreneur,=
 you can
> roll up your sleeves and get to work. We=E2=80=99d love your help in shar=
ing that
> message and referring amazing, proven founders to us to drive the sector
> forward. And we=E2=80=99ll be working with founders through events, conte=
nt,
> Slacks, Zooms, and every other way we can to enable their success.
> *Conclusion*
>
> 2020 was a rough but rewarding year - apologies again for the huge delays
> in this update. Thanks to Honduras Pr=C3=B3spera, the sector has finally =
gone
> from zero to one. The hardest part is behind us, but a mountain of work
> lies ahead to found a network of startup cities and ensure that they
> succeed. Thanks so much for being on this adventure with us, and we look
> forward to communicating more often with you in the second half of 2021.
