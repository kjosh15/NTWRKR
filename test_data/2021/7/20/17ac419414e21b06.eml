Very helpful, thanks! This is obviously opportunistic, so another opinion
counts a lot!

All best,

I=E2=80=99m no medic, so I can just share some science based info.<br>
Clinical trials for a 3rd Pfizer shot have been done as a booster, but only=
 after quite a few months after shot 2, so as far as I know there are no cl=
inical trials available to give indications on your situation. I=E2=80=99m =
not aware of the booster trial results. The UK has been talking of doing bo=
osters in Oct, but no clear medical advice or decisions yet.<br>
<br>
If it were me, I would just stick with the 2 Pfizer shots already done. The=
 coverage rate it super high ( 94/95%), and proven cover for the Delta vari=
ant too above 74/75%.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>
Best,<br>
