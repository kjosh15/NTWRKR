Hi Josh,
I=E2=80=99m no medic, so I can just share some science based info.
Clinical trials for a 3rd Pfizer shot have been done as a booster, but only
after quite a few months after shot 2, so as far as I know there are no
clinical trials available to give indications on your situation. I=E2=80=99=
m not
aware of the booster trial results. The UK has been talking of doing
boosters in Oct, but no clear medical advice or decisions yet.

If it were me, I would just stick with the 2 Pfizer shots already done. The
coverage rate it super high ( 94/95%), and proven cover for the Delta
variant too above 74/75%.

Hope this helps!
Best,
Annalisa
