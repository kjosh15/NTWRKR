Here=E2=80=99s an odd one; I had my second Pfizer shot three weeks ago in I=
celand.
Today I=E2=80=99m in NYC, where spare shots are being thrown away due to la=
ck of
uptake. I=E2=80=99m not immunocompromised, and had almost no response to th=
e second
shot (which likely doesn=E2=80=99t mean anything.) Should I get a third sho=
t while
I=E2=80=99m here?

If I were to do it it=E2=80=99d be tomorrow or the day after - just before =
I leave.
There are physiological questions; after only three weeks since my second
shot would it significantly boost my antibodies? Am I likely to feel sick
on an international redeye? What are the risks of complications? And moral
ones; am I taking a shot away from someone who needs it?

I recognize this is a personal question, but I don=E2=80=99t have many frie=
nds
whose scientific and moral standing I respect as much as yours. What would
you do, and why?

As ever, very much obliged!
- J
