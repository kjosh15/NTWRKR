Clinical trials for a 3rd Pfizer shot have been done as a booster, but only a=
fter quite a few months after shot 2, so as far as I know there are no clini=
cal trials available to give indications on your situation. I=E2=80=99m not a=

 in Oct, but no clear medical advice or decisions yet.<br>
<br>
If it were me, I would just stick with the 2 Pfizer shots already done. The c=
overage rate it super high ( 94/95%), and proven cover for the Delta variant=
 too above 74/75%.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>
