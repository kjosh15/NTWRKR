Very cool! Thanks for the heads up. I=E2=80=99m in iceland these days, head=
s-down
on a startup that measures and changes employee behavior at scale
algorithmically. You=E2=80=99d eat it up - huge implications. Hit me up for=
 a call
sometime and let=E2=80=99s compare notes!!

All best,
Josh
