Good news; it looks like Blaze's folks are going to be out of town and have
offered me their apartment for the duration. That said, my offer still
stands if you want to schedule me in to take the kids and give yourselves
some time - I know Weena's got a bunch of classes coming up! Let me know
what works.

Similarly, we have a bunch of boxes at yours that I'm keen to clear out;
let me know when a good time to come by and do a bit of sorting might be.

Looking forward to it!!
Josh
