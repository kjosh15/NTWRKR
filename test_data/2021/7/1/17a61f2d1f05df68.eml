Thanks, Scott! The invite didn't have any dates or times, though?

I'm not at liberty to give a keynote but am happy to field any Q&A; I'd
also be quite keen to hear from the team about their strategy post-covid,
what you're doing with cross-platform integrations and upselling, how
you're forecasting pricing for the next 18 months, and what you recommend
in terms of strategic partnerships given same.

Looking forward to it!
- J

P.S. Any word on that first view of the edited video?
