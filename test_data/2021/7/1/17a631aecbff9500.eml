Anna Hildur,

We're helping pull together a group of folks interested in improving the
Icelandic academic system, particularly for boys. We've got a politician
(Helga Vala Helgadottir), a lead at CCP (Tryggvi Hjaltason), a
neuroscientist, a TV host (Egill Helgasson
<https://www.ruv.is/frett/2021/02/07/bil-milli-kynja-i-skolakerfinu-eykst>)=
,
etc. and were wondering if:

a) this is something you'd be interested in?
b) you know anyone else we should talk to?
c) you can see a tie-in to Tungumalatofrar, or maybe Eliza Reid?

Hope you're doing well; drop us a line when you've caught your breath and
let's make plans to connect this summer! Do you know when Harry is due to
arrive?

All best,
Josh
