Amazing!!! I cannot thank you both enough; this is a total lifesaver, esp.
as I'm going to have to spend some real time sorting through our old
apartment, so being right nearby is a godsend.

ATM 7/16 looks like our best bet, but I'll hold 7/17 as long as I can (I'm
also supposed to be talking to potential investors and stuff). Would be
lovely to see you (or as many of you as are available) again!!

Gratefully,
Josh
