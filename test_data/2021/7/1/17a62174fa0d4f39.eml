Sorry to miss Ori but will be stoked to see the rest of you. Mostly I need
time to go through the stuff you so kindly took from our apt.; other than
that it'd be nice just to hang out, maybe do dinner on the 17th/18th if
you're around.

Let me know if it's possible to come by some morning/afternoon that weekend
to do some sorting. Happy to run Kraken with Joni if she'd like, or just
let me know if there's anything else I can do to be helpful!!
