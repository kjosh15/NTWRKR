Just got some feedback from my CISO friend who's run through a number of
early companies in the space (please don't share, obvs.):

"My read on this is it=E2=80=99s basically =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll save you t=
he hassle of walking the
edge of the RSA floor to talk to all the startups and just bubble up the
ones that are most relevant to you=E2=80=9D. I like the idea, esp as it=E2=
=80=99s sort of
the opposite end of the spectrum of Forrester/Gartner where you=E2=80=99re =
getting
far more fully baked companies (in general). For companies looking to solve
new and odd cybersecurity problems (like k8s security, for example) I can
see where this service would be useful=E2=80=A6 IF=E2=80=A6 the companies t=
hat have this
problem actually also care about security and have it as a function.

Fun fact, I=E2=80=99m starting a new job next month with a startup (~200 pp=
l, 2
years old) that hasn=E2=80=99t had a security function formally implemented=
. This
is the kind of company that could benefit form this service but until they
hire a full time CISO they might not have cared about the innovations being
surfaced through this service. That might be a factor in how well they can
reach their audience."

Do you think he has you right? It sounds like good timing, in any case - he
wants to get settled in the new role and I'll loop him in with you.

All best,
Josh
