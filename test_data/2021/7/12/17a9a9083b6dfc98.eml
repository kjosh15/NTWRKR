Yes, although I leave the day after for NYC so I may be a bit haggard. I
won't wear my hat, however, so you can enjoy that in lieu of my usual
semi-cognisance.

Thanks also for the letters! It's interesting as I spend (what feels like)
an inordinate amount of time writing emails attempting to achieve the same
goals you outlined. I suspect presentation also adds a great deal; do you
invest a lot of thought in paper stock, size, shipping, etc.?
