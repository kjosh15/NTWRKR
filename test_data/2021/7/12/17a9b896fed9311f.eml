Congrats! Let me know when you're back and settled; I'd be curious how the
last year's treated you.

In the meantime, let me know if you want to talk to CrestingWave, or know
anyone in a similar position that could benefit from the connection. Based
on your (and similar) feedback I might do some work for them helping get
them connected to folks like yourself - assuming I can figure a way to do
so that actually adds value / is fun!

Iceland has been dumping a ton of money into infrastructure in anticipation
of a resumption of the tourist boom, and biking has really taken off this
last year, so if you want to bike the roads are in great shape! I've mostly
been doing trail running, myself, but have been eying some bikes... It does
look like fun!

All best,
Josh
