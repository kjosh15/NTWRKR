Hi Josh!

Apologies for the delay -- our offices were closed for a summer break (in
addition to July 4).

<<knee-deep in the future of work with senior leaders from nearly every
vertical and there's a tremendous amount of practical on-the-ground
insights that are being missed.>>

Intrigued by this! Can you share a few topic ideas that will be extra
relevant and you will be passionate about in March 2021?

<<Also, did you make it to CO, and if so how do you like it? We're likely
to stay in Iceland another year, but are starting to scope out where to
head to after that!>>

We sure did! Been living here and settling into the new house since June 1.
We are loving it so far. Several camping trips have already taken place.

Nice! That sounds wonderful. I'll keep saying it....I hope to visit Iceland
one day. I'm curious to see where you will land next!

Sincerely,

Dhinuka
