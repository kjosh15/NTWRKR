Sorry for late reply, I was busy with a crow project.
I have a good news. I have reached the 3rd stage of training. The bird put
coins in a box and take a peanut. But unfortunately, the bird has not
arrived in the last few days, I don't know why, maybe something happened to
her.
I developed a new neural network for detecting cigarette butts, I will be
testing it soon.
I started developing a new device to train crows to collect cigarette
butts. I have a first version.

IndigoMetrics - cool idea, I heard about this before. I would like to see
how this system works in real life using the example of large teams.

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing - very interesting idea, and as I
realized the level of glucose in the blood can affect many things.
