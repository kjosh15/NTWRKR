Good morning Josh!
I had reached out to you because I saw your Ted Talk on your study of
crows. Having many near my house at the time, I was fascinated and had the
intention of making my own crow box.
Unfortunately, things change, I've moved, and had to redirect my energies
toward ailing family members.
Your projects look fascinating, especially IndigoMetrics; giving employers
the ability to hone and manage their workforce with this data is
fascinating.
Unfortunately, there isn't anything in my educational background that would
lend itself to these projects.
Thank you very much for including me in your endeavors! They look wonderful
and I wish you success!
Sincerely,
Polly
