Hey Josh,

We=E2=80=99re set for the 19th.  Allie will send over the location =
details, call sheet, etc - but it will be in the Park Slope / Gowanus =
area in Brooklyn, and a 9am start works great.  Should have you wrapped =
no later than 11am.

As for content - we=E2=80=99re also getting feedback from our agents =
tomorrow afternoon, so will touch base again after that with anything =
else we should get in addition to what=E2=80=99s already in there.

Pumped to meet you IRL, man!  More soon.=20
