Thanks for the update! Would love to see footage of your setup, the crow in
action, etc. And the neural network also sounds super interesting; do you
have documentation up somewhere? Excited to hear about your successes; how
can we help?

indigometrics is a very fun project; we're working with several large
multionationals (>30k employees) and it works quite well. Where did you
hear about this before?

All best,
Josh
