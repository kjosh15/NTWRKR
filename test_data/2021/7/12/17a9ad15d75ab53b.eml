Hey there,
My read on this is it=E2=80=99s basically =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll save you the=
 hassle of walking the edge of the RSA floor to talk to all the startups and=
 just bubble up the ones that are most relevant to you=E2=80=9D. I like the i=
dea, esp as it=E2=80=99s sort of the opposite end of the spectrum of Forrest=
er/Gartner where you=E2=80=99re getting far more fully baked companies (in g=
eneral). For companies looking to solve new and odd cybersecurity problems (=
like k8s security, for example) I can see where this service would be useful=
=E2=80=A6 IF=E2=80=A6 the companies that have this problem actually also car=
e about security and have it as a function.

Fun fact, I=E2=80=99m starting a new job next month with a startup (~200 ppl=
, 2 years old) that hasn=E2=80=99t had a security function formally implemen=
ted. This is the kind of company that could benefit form this service but un=
til they hire a full time CISO they might not have cared about the innovatio=
ns being surfaced through this service. That might be a factor in how well t=
hey can reach their audience.

$newCo is in NYC, so I=E2=80=99ll be up there more often than in the past (t=
ho not next week.. I=E2=80=99ll be in upstate NY chilling in the finger lake=
s). I=E2=80=99d certainly like to get to Iceland at some point.. really itch=
ing to cycle around the whole island, honestly.
