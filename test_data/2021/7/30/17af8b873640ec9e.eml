Hello everyone -

I know we are 9 months out, but we set up the agenda 2 years ago so I wante=
d to get a reality check and see 1) if you are still available at the 2022 =
dates, 2) how the session discussion may/will change given 2 years of COVID=
 and a different world today as well as new work/changes in your own work, =
3) how I may need to change the conference direction/agenda/intro, and 4) w=
hat new/different things/support you may need from me/SEI.

I will start contacting each of you to talk about your specific session and=
 the topic you would like to address, and then once I have done that, I wil=
l adjust the conference overview and agenda.  I would intend to talk to you=
 all again in Feb/March 2022 right before the event so I can give you speci=
fic details about the audience, what's happening at SEI and in the world ec=
onomy/wealth management industry so you can hone your presentation to them.

As reference, below is what agreed to for the 2020 and then 2021 conference=
.

Many thanks!

Ross Ellis

The Future of Intelligence

"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change." So said the English theor=
etical physicist, cosmologist, and author Stephen Hawking.

The conceptual definition refers to intelligence as the ability to learn fr=
om experience, recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, solve problems, use ou=
r knowledge to adapt to new situations and use language to communicate. In =
research studies, intelligence is whatever the intelligence test measures, =
which could vary by culture and region.

Artificial intelligence and human intelligence delve into cognitive functio=
ns such as memory, problem-solving, learning, planning, language, reasoning=
, and perception. AI is an innovation created by human intelligence and it =
is designed to do specific tasks much faster with less effort. But with mac=
hine learning, the system itself has the ability to automatically learn and=
 improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

On the other hand, human intelligence is better at multi-tasking. It can in=
corporate emotional elements, human interaction, as well as self-awareness =
in the cognitive process.

Given how diverse an individual's abilities are, it may not be justifiable =
to label all those abilities into a single word, intelligence. Perhaps thes=
e diverse abilities represent different kinds of intelligence.

Was Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man character intelligent? While he had significa=
nt mental disabilities, as a savant, he demonstrated certain mathematical a=
nd memory abilities far in excess of average. What about Toulouse-Lautrec o=
r Beethoven, both of whom suffered medical maladies and were deemed artisti=
c geniuses, but were they intelligent? Some researchers have also concluded=
 that plants exhibit the simple forms of behavior that neuroscientists desc=
ribe as basic intelligence.

At this, our 17th annual Executive Conference, we will address a variety of=
 ways intelligence can be defined, how it affects the financial services ec=
osystem and society at large, as well as introduce the power of what humans=
 can produce through perseverance, empathy and self-awareness.

As our experiences with Amazon, Google, AirBnB and others outside the wealt=
h management ecosystem inform how we and our customers behave, we'll introd=
uce expert speakers from outside the industry to share their unique insight=
s.  While there is no one best approach to every situation, we aim to provi=
de thought-provoking ideas and demonstrate ways that enable you to succeed =
and thrive in an otherwise complex and exponentially fast-moving world.

Geopolitical Commentary
Peter Zeihan, Geopolitical Strategist and Critically-acclaimed Author

The world is changing fast. Demographic shifts are turning everything we kn=
ow about the global economy on its ear. The concept of countries being able=
 to buy and sell their wares openly on the international marketplace is inv=
iolable. The freedom to sail one's products around the world is a given. Ev=
erything from the transfer of money to the accessibility of energy is sacro=
sanct. Yet all this and more is artificial: an unintended - if happy - side=
 effect of the American-led global Order. With that Order in its final days=
, all countries and all industries must learn to operate in a world as unst=
ructured as it is dangerous. Join us as Peter lays out how we got to where =
we are, and what the future holds for sectors as diverse as energy, agricul=
ture, finance, manufacturing and transport.

The State of the Global Asset and Wealth Management Industry
Lubasha Heredia, Partner and Managing Director, Boston Consulting Group

The global asset management industry continues its reach for growth while b=
attling numerous headwinds. In 2019, we witnessed robust market performance=
 - multiple indices worldwide posting 20%+ returns - markedly recovering fr=
om the downturn experienced in the year prior. While some managers apatheti=
cally rode the favorable market wave, others took the chance to actively ad=
dress their strategic positioning. Select firms acknowledged cost pressures=
 and responded with job cuts while others monitored and set expectations ar=
ound the downward trend in fees. While challenging developments linger, the=
 picture isn't entirely gloomy. Asset managers report operating margins tha=
t continue to be envious in the eye of other industries and the most succes=
sful firms have well-defined blueprints to secure their place in the future=
.

As we look toward the 2020 decade, we expect to encounter more market volat=
ility, increased competition, and economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Bu=
t we also see opportunities as the asset and wealth management industry evo=
lves and as technology moves to center stage. So which trends and dynamics =
will ultimately prevail? Will these '20s roar for asset managers or not? Lu=
basha will discuss the trends BCG sees dominating the next few years.

The Future of Data Intelligence
Josh Klein, Speaker, Writer, Consultant and Hacker

Big data and analytics are changing how everything operates, from small-sca=
le companies employing third-party solutions (like the project management s=
oftware that obviated project managers) to massive multinationals who are i=
nheriting systemic algorithmic bias (such as Cambridge Analytica displayed)=
, and from governments like China and the EU (who are legislating technolog=
y controls in very different ways) to the U.S. (which basically isn't legis=
lating technology controls at all.)

Josh will provide concrete examples and strategic analysis to show the myri=
ad ways in which we're under-estimating the potential impact of the data we=
're collecting and how it might ultimately be used. From surreptitious soci=
al controls in the workplace to 1984-style "thought crime" governance, the =
potential that technology has to change the way society operates in the ver=
y near future has never been so great. Learn what we're underestimating and=
 where we can get the most leverage in what that entails.

Digital Biology: Programming for the Future of Life
Tiffany Vora, Faculty and Vice Chair of Medicine and Digital Biology at Sin=
gularity University, Writer, Research Scientist and Entrepreneur

The life sciences are a critical component of the global economy and of mod=
ern life. Just as computers store information as strings of 0s and 1s, on E=
arth, living systems store information in DNA. By reading out this informat=
ion, digital biology is revolutionizing human health and wellness, agricult=
ure, environmental monitoring and remediation, biofuel production, and many=
 other industries. Excitingly, this paradigm of "DNA as information" sugges=
ts that living systems are just that: systems that can be "programmed" by a=
ltering their DNA "algorithms." Although the application of digital biology=
 raises profound ethical, governmental, and environmental questions, Tiffan=
y shows us how these technologies provide a tremendous opportunity to solve=
 some of humanity's global grand challenges, such as health, food, water, e=
nergy, the environment, and even space.

If the 20th century was the Computer Age, then the 21st century will be the=
 Biology Age.

The Art of Perception: Visual Intelligence
Amy Herman, Art Historian, Lawyer and Author

How could looking at Monet's water lily paintings help save your company mi=
llions? How can checking out people's footwear foil a terrorist attack? How=
 can your choice of adjective win an argument, calm your kid, or catch a th=
ief? Art historian Amy Herman has trained experts from many fields how to p=
erceive and communicate better. By showing people how to look closely at im=
ages, she helps them hone their "visual intelligence," a set of skills we a=
ll possess but few of us know how to use properly. She has spent more than =
a decade teaching doctors to observe patients instead of their charts, help=
ing police officers separate facts from opinions when investigating a crime=
, and training professionals from the FBI, the State Department, Fortune 50=
0 companies, and the military to recognize the most pertinent and useful in=
formation. Her lessons highlight far more than the physical objects you may=
 be missing; they teach you how to recognize the talents, opportunities, an=
d dangers that surround you every day.

lay. Dr. Rana el Kaliouby believes they can do much more. An expert in arti=
ficial emotional intelligence, or "Emotion AI," Dr. el Kaliouby explores th=
e valuable applications of humanized technology in media and advertising, g=
aming, automotive, robotics, health, education and more. She explains how m=
achine learning works, explores the potential for the development of emotio=
n chips, and addresses the ethics and privacy issues of Emotion AI. In her =
talks, Dr. el Kaliouby gives participants an inside look at the world's lar=

e than 5 million faces around the world, and reveals that the emoji mindset=
 may soon be a thing of the past.

Discomfort is the Key to Maximizing Your Talents
Brian Dawkins, Former Philadelphia Eagles Player, 2018 Pro Football Hall of=
 Fame Inductee

Through personal experience and insightful story-telling, former Philadelph=
ia Eagles safety and 2018 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Brian Dawkins =
shares his belief that being comfortable is the enemy of growth. Not blesse=
d with the "right" physical attributes of other players, Brian's work ethic=
, intense passion, and unrelenting desire to never rest on his laurels enab=
led him to maximize his talents and perform at levels far exceeding team ex=
pectations. In this dynamic and uplifting presentation, you will see how hi=
s experience in football, never settling for the status quo and pushing thr=
ough discomfort translates to success in life off the field and is highly r=
elevant to those in other industries. Following the presentation, Brian enc=
ourages any and all questions on any topic: football, business, life.

Artificial Intelligence
Bruce Holley, Senior Managing Director, Accenture Financial Services, Custo=
mer Insight & Growth, North America Lead

What do people actually mean when they talk about "artificial intelligence"=
 or AI? There is a lack of clarity around the definition of AI, which can f=
requently lead to confusion and, at times, disagreement. AI is about a set =
of capabilities that can enable a business to run in new ways. At the core =
of these capabilities are a suite of technologies that enable adaptive pred=
ictive power by using proprietary company and third party data. By linking =
this predictive power to business decisions, new behaviors, and customer ex=
perience, companies can drive revenue growth, take out costs, and deliver o=
ther non-financial value metrics. How can banks, wealth managers and asset =
managers harness the power of AI?

The Future of Workplace Intelligence: Rethinking Talent, Careers & 'Jobs'
April Rinne, Advisor, Speaker, Writer and Global Citizen

For the past several decades, we've lived in a world in which full-time job=
s and lifetime employment were the goal and norm. Few people thought twice =
about going to an office every day or working on a set schedule; this was s=
imply how business was done. Parents' advice to "study hard, get good grade=
s, go to college and you'll be guaranteed a good job" often held true. An i=
ntelligent workplace reflected all of these things. And yet, today each of =
these assumptions is being systematically disrupted - with profound impacts=
 on the future of talent and intelligence. From the rise of freelancing, "d=
igital nomads" and the gig economy to the rapid expansion of remote work or=
 the unknowns of automation and AI, we see massive shifts in who, where and=
 how people can work.

While these shifts are driven largely by technology, they also reflect evol=
ving priorities, values and cultures. Around the world, individuals and org=
anizations are rethinking how intelligence is organized, where it can be lo=
cated, who can participate, what this means for professional development, e=
ducation and public policy... and, of course, how this affects investment. =
April will take us on a journey through this new work landscape, sharing in=
sights and examples from her experiences in more than 100 countries and hel=
ping you understand what these changes mean for you, your portfolio, your o=
rganization and your family.

How to Turn Challenge into Opportunity and Disruption into Competitive Adva=
ntage
Peter Sheahan, Founder & Group CEO, Karrikins Group

The fact that the world is changing is not new to anyone. The more importan=
t question is, what do we need to do in the face of change? As the pace of =
commoditization accelerates, client expectations shift, and technological d=
isruption consistently changes the playing field, we must transform ourselv=
es and our teams at a faster rate than the external environment is changing=
. Transformation starts with leaders going first and embracing the critical=
 role they play in aligning their teams behind a strategic vision to find o=
pportunity in a rapidly changing, competitive environment.

In this engaging, case study rich session, Peter Sheahan will explore the i=
nternal transformation that you need to undertake in order to lead your cli=
ents and organizations to the future. He will use real world examples of ho=
w leaders took ownership, unleashed a burning ambition, and identified how =
their own behavior needs to shift so they could turn disruption into opport=
unity and change into competitive advantage. After all, organizations don't=
 change-people do.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b>The Future of Intelligence<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&#8220;Intelligence is the ability to adapt to chang=
e.&#8221; So said the English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and autho=
r Stephen Hawking.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The conceptual definition refers to intelligence as =
the ability to learn from experience, recognize patterns, comprehend ideas,=
 solve problems, use our knowledge to adapt to new situations and use langu=
age to communicate. In research studies,
 intelligence is whatever the intelligence test measures, which could vary =
by culture and region.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Artificial intelligence and human intelligence delve=
 into cognitive functions such as memory, problem-solving, learning, planni=
ng, language, reasoning, and perception. AI is an innovation created by hum=
an intelligence and it is designed
 to do specific tasks much faster with less effort. But with machine learni=
ng, the system itself has the ability to automatically learn and improve fr=
om experience without being explicitly programmed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">On the other hand, human intelligence is better at m=
ulti-tasking. It can incorporate emotional elements, human interaction, as =
well as self-awareness in the cognitive process.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Given how diverse an individual&#8217;s abilities ar=
e, it may not be justifiable to label all those abilities into a single wor=
d, intelligence. Perhaps these diverse abilities represent different kinds =
of intelligence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Was Dustin Hoffman&#8217;s Rain Man character intell=
igent? While he had significant mental disabilities, as a savant, he demons=
trated certain mathematical and memory abilities far in excess of average. =
What about Toulouse-Lautrec or Beethoven,
 both of whom suffered medical maladies and were deemed artistic geniuses, =
but were they intelligent? Some researchers have also concluded that plants=
 exhibit the simple forms of behavior that neuroscientists describe as basi=
c intelligence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At this, our 17th annual Executive Conference, we wi=
ll address a variety of ways intelligence can be defined, how it affects th=
e financial services ecosystem and society at large, as well as introduce t=
he power of what humans can produce
 through perseverance, empathy and self-awareness.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As our experiences with Amazon, Google, AirBnB and o=
thers outside the wealth management ecosystem inform how we and our custome=
rs behave, we&#8217;ll introduce expert speakers from outside the industry =
to share their unique insights.&nbsp; While there
 is no one best approach to every situation, we aim to provide thought-prov=
oking ideas and demonstrate ways that enable you to succeed and thrive in a=
n otherwise complex and exponentially fast-moving world.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The world is changing fast. Demographic shifts are t=

of countries being able to buy and sell their wares openly on the internati=
onal marketplace is inviolable. The
 freedom to sail one&#8217;s products around the world is a given. Everythi=

 Yet all this and more is artificial: an unintended &#8212; if happy &#8212=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The global asset management industry continues its r=
each for growth while battling numerous headwinds. In 2019, we witnessed ro=
bust market performance &#8212; multiple indices worldwide posting 20%&#43;=
 returns &#8212; markedly recovering from the downturn
 experienced in the year prior. While some managers apathetically rode the =
favorable market wave, others took the chance to actively address their str=
ategic positioning. Select firms acknowledged cost pressures and responded =
with job cuts while others monitored
 and set expectations around the downward trend in fees. While challenging =
developments linger, the picture isn&#8217;t entirely gloomy. Asset manager=
s report operating margins that continue to be envious in the eye of other =
industries and the most successful firms
 have well-defined blueprints to secure their place in the future.<o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As we look toward the 2020 decade, we expect to enco=
unter more market volatility, increased competition, and economic and geopo=
litical uncertainty. But we also see opportunities as the asset and wealth =
management industry evolves and as
 technology moves to center stage. So which trends and dynamics will ultima=
tely prevail? Will these '20s roar for asset managers or not? Lubasha will =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Big data and analytics are changing how everything o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The life sciences are a critical component of the gl=

8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; or AI? There is a lack of clarity aroun=
d the definition of AI, which can frequently lead to confusion and, at time=
s, disagreement. AI is about a set of capabilities
 that can enable a business to run in new ways. At the core of these capabi=
lities are a suite of technologies that enable adaptive predictive power by=
 using proprietary company and third party data. By linking this predictive=
 power to business decisions, new
 behaviors, and customer experience, companies can drive revenue growth, ta=
ke out costs, and deliver other non-financial value metrics. How can banks,=
 wealth managers and asset managers harness the power of AI?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><i><u>April Rinne, Advisor, Speaker, Writer and G=
lobal Citizen<o:p></o:p></u></i></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">For the past several decades, we've lived in a world=
 in which full-time jobs and lifetime employment were the goal and norm. Fe=
w people thought twice about going to an office every day or working on a s=
et schedule; this was simply how business
 was done. Parents' advice to &quot;study hard, get good grades, go to coll=
ege and you'll be guaranteed a good job&quot; often held true. An intellige=
nt workplace reflected all of these things. And yet, today each of these as=
sumptions is being systematically disrupted
 &#8212; with profound impacts on the future of talent and intelligence. Fr=
om the rise of freelancing, &quot;digital nomads&quot; and the gig economy =
to the rapid expansion of remote work or the unknowns of automation and AI,=
 we see massive shifts in who, where and how people
 can work.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">While these shifts are driven largely by technology,=
 they also reflect evolving priorities, values and cultures. Around the wor=
ld, individuals and organizations are rethinking how intelligence is organi=
zed, where it can be located, who
 can participate, what this means for professional development, education a=
nd public policy... and, of course, how this affects investment. April will=
 take us on a journey through this new work landscape, sharing insights and=
 examples from her experiences in
 more than 100 countries and helping you understand what these changes mean=
 for you, your portfolio, your organization and your family.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The fact that the world is changing is not new to an=
yone. The more important question is, what do we need to do in the face of =
change? As the pace of commoditization accelerates, client expectations shi=
ft, and technological disruption consistently
 changes the playing field, we must transform ourselves and our teams at a =
faster rate than the external environment is changing. Transformation start=
s with leaders going first and embracing the critical role they play in ali=
gning their teams behind a strategic
 vision to find opportunity in a rapidly changing, competitive environment.=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In this engaging, case study rich session, Peter She=
ahan will explore the internal transformation that you need to undertake in=
 order to lead your clients and organizations to the future. He will use re=
al world examples of how leaders took
 ownership, unleashed a burning ambition, and identified how their own beha=
vior needs to shift so they could turn disruption into opportunity and chan=
ge into competitive advantage. After all, organizations don&#8217;t change&=
#8212;people do.<o:p></o:p></p>
