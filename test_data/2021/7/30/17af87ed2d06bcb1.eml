on data to drive value from corporate assets. But at the same time, the Gre=

ty in the workforce.</div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"auto">The=
se trends are on a collision course as data is being collected - and used -=
 at a breakneck pace. I=E2=80=99d like to give several case studies on how =
this has worked badly (in terms of privacy, churn, conduct risk, and PR) as=
 well as how organizations can approach their rich new data ecosystem to cr=
eate cumulative, agile, human-centric value.</div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></d=
iv><div dir=3D"auto">- ESG as KPI: activist investors, informed and motivat=
ed consumers, and extremely dynamic market conditions are shifting how comp=
anies measure and create value in some big ways - but so far we=E2=80=99ve =
only seen the tip of the iceberg. Come hear =C2=A0how ESG is a lens not onl=
y for your PR and Reporting strategies, but also your Innovation and Techno=
logy plans.=C2=A0</div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"auto">- The =
Permeable Organization: the pandemic disrupted supply chains, accelerated i=
nnovation initiatives, and enabled a sea-change in consumer behavior. Organ=
izations that were able to quickly integrate outside assets through licensi=
ng, partnerships, JVs, and M&amp;A have been fast outpacing their competito=
rs and will continue to do so. The more an organization can enable this fre=
e-flow of capacity into and out of their structures the better they are abl=
e to take advantage of the new dynamism markets now demand, but this is no =
easy feat. Come learn what new best practices are for success in a very dif=
