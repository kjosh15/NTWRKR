*TL;DR: Happy Summer!*

Everything has slowed down in the summer slump but our assertions are still
in process, with good conversations with a variety of large enterprises. I
wish you and yours all the best in rest and recovery - my suspicion is that
things are going to accelerate significantly going into 2022!!

All best,
Josh
