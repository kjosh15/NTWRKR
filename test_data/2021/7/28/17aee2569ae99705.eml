Thanks for the follow-up! I took some time off last week so apologies for
the delay.

Awesome ideas -- love the timeliness and relevance.

I'm between meetings so sending you a quick note to let you know I am
actively talking internally about these topics. There is interest from
either myself or one of my colleagues dependant on the subject -- we just
need to figure out the highest impact place for it within our 2022 tracks.

I'll get back to you soon with either feedback or next steps.
