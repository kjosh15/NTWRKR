We have two winning ideas! Data-led culture & ESG as KPI.

I can't guarantee both yet but we want to move forward with evaluating 2 of
your sessions through the PanelPicker process so that we can get more staff
and advisors to weigh in with their grading.

Can you enter both ideas as session proposals through my private
PanelPicker links? Preferably by Monday if possible.

Here are the formal (and confidential directions):

- Create a SXSW user account here -- https://id.sxsw.com/sign_up (if you
already have a username, skip this step and login here --
https://id.sxsw.com/sign_in)

- Once logged into the system, copy and paste this URL into the existing
browser window --

https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/new/sxsw?token=3Dmulti

- This will drop you into the SXSW Conference Entry form, follow the on
screen instructions to successfully enter.

Please note that you will not be able to edit your entry once it has been
received.

////

Let me know if you have any questions!
