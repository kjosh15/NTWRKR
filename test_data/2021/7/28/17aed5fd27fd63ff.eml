yo man sorry for the delay:

Bitcoin-equivalent?
I have nothing written about this but probably should, though I'd be
surprised if this wasn't an idea already on the table for them.

Richard Colacino <http://www.rcfinancialplanning.com/team/richard-colacino#=

he and his dad do my taxes but he's also a wealth manager and pretty sharp.
I also use Kent Fox
<https://fa.ml.com/north-carolina/charlotte/fox_kaplan_group/> although he
handles more of the Steele estate stuff.
> Precursers & 5HTP
My buddy is saying that the serotonin precursor he's now using is
tryptophan, but they both are serotonin building blocks. There's no best
brand, it's not something they generally cut costs on unlike
vitamins/minerals. Get bang for your buck per dose.
> Vested stock
Every exit is a unique and beautiful event. You should chat with Rich or
another advisor or/also someone from their company about if those options
will convert or if it makes sense to exercise prior to sale.

good luck with your noodles, I will report back on the fish drying!
