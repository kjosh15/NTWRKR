Kyle,

Thanks again for a fabulous dinner last week; it was pitch-perfect and an
incredible way to accelerate an already crazy impactful team.

We spoke briefly about the potential for live events and taking the podcast
content to new audiences in new ways. Is it worth a brief call in the next
couple weeks to see how/if we could collaborate to move this forward? I've
been chewing on a bunch of ideas and I think you'd have some good insights
on where/how/if they might be useful.

All best wishes,
Josh
