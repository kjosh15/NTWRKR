Allen, please meet Sina. He's the very, very sharp founder of Nayya, and he
is looking to fill some roles so of course I thought of you.

Sina, Allen has worked in this space for some time; you won't find a better
eye for talent nor mind for startups - it'll be well worth your time to
have a conversation with him.

I leave it to you two from here!

All best,
Josh
