Ashley,

Thanks again for a fabulous dinner last week. Let me know if you'd like an
intro to my Krav Maga studio, fithit.com (I think you'd really like a trial
class!)

Otherwise, I'd love to have a quick call to talk through how else the
podcast content could be used and to brainstorm additional platforms and
ways to extend the brand. Are you available in the next couple weeks to
connect?

All best wishes,
Josh
