There have been a few of these; I always wonder if the uncanny valley
effect doesn't counteract any benefits.

On a similar note, I host a podcast for Accenture and they were recently
previewing some new tech that takes footage of real people and "learns" to
then recast them saying the same text in different languages and accents.
It's not quite picture-perfect, but is close enough that you can see it
coming. It's deepfakes coming for film, tv, etc. ...

Hope you're well,
Josh
