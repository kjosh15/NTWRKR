As usual I had a bunch of notes from our dinner:

- Did you have anything written about wrapping Bitcoin to make a USA
Bitcoin-equivalent?
- You mentioned you had a wealth manager and tax guy - =E2=80=9CRich=E2=80=
=9D - who was
worth talking to. Can you introduce?
- I had a mysterious note labeled "Precursers; 5htp." What do you recommend=
?

A pleasure as always,
Josh

P.S.: you also said I could use Nutritional yeast to make quality Chinese
noodles <https://www.seriouseats.com/hand-pulled-lamian-noodles>. No
shit!!! Let me know how your dried/smoked/dried fish efforts go - I'll have
a smokehouse again in a month or so...
