So cool!! You've done some very nice work there. Keep us posted!

Did the jackdaw return? Unfortunately there are many reasons she may have
left; a new mate, better food source, territory competition, etc.

Let us know if we can be of help and how the neural network is progressing.
Very exciting work!!
