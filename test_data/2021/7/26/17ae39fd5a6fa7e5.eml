Also - since you've been through this more often than I have - I have a
stock question for you. Or maybe it's for your man Rich.

I have vested stock (from advising) in a startup which may soon have a sale
event. My understanding is that exercising now, before the deal closes, can
prevent it being considered a cancellation of stock options (which is
subject to payroll tax) and instead would be a disqualifying disposition.
Do you know if that's the case, and if so what do you recommend?
