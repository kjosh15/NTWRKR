Marc,

Thanks again for a fabulous dinner last week; it was super helpful to meet
the whole team in person and got me even more excited about the potential
for this content!!

Aside from shooting in a hot spring here in Iceland I was particularly
interested in the potential for migrating this content to other media, such
as video, cross-platform, etc.

I also really appreciated your comments about the work that Accenture Labs
are doing. Entirely separate from the podcast I've been talking with
Saideep Raj, your global Senior Managing Director for Innovation, who
helped me get some insight into its breadth and potential impact.

Are you available for a brief call in the next couple weeks to compare
notes on some ideas? Ever since the dinner I've been having "Oh yeah, and
we could..." moments and I'd love to get your take on what might be
actionable!

All best,
Josh
