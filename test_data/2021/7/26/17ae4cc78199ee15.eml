Sorry, I've been a little checked out helping my siblings manage my mom's
health care plan. Things are flattening out a bit now.

I think you're right. We've attracted introverts. There's some internet
glory to be had here for anyone to become the first successful phase 4
operator with videos. Not sure how to incentivize them, though.

I do like this idea of yours to just make a call for video submissions.
That could tease out some participants who've not gotten around to actually
recording what they are up to.

How's Rodion doing now? He seems like a good candidate to make it, but it
seems like he doesn't have the right type of birds around him?
