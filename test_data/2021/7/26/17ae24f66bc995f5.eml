Good to hear from you! And I'll focus on the AOL account going forward...
I'm a little surprised you have it as primary myself!

I think your guess as to the numbers of crows is a good one; songbird
fatality rates tend to be around 80-90% so I'd guess that a good year for
birds generally would result in a lot of new crows. Try learning some
border alarm calls and see how they react; I accidentally got my wife and I
swarmed once in Seattle that way. She was not happy...

Do come to Iceland! My in-laws are all certified guides so we can point you
to the best places. I just came back from a short trip to NYC to wrap up
our apartment, say goodbye to friends, etc. Bittersweet, but the longer we
stay outside the US the stranger it seems over there. May we all live in
interesting times, I guess!

All best,
Josh
