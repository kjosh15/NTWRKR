Hey Oscar,

At this point the only blackouts would be the week before and after the new
year, as most of the work I'll be doing will be at my discretion - the
concern is that as my calendar fills up it will be harder to find time to
schedule, and I don't want to be responsible for delaying anything!

That said, the timeline you sent should work ok, presuming we're able to
get started in August. Do you know what the schedule looks like so far?

Thanks!
Josh

&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi, Josh:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for your patience as we work through the 9 =E2=80=93 16 Option =
Term episodes with the Accenture client and NYT production. Also copying my=
 colleague, Nicole, who=E2=80=99s been helping to lead conversations betwee=
n NYT and Accenture.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I =C2=A0know the NYT has been in touch with you and Elise to schedule =
host services for episodes and the plan is to work on the remaining first 8=
 episodes through September 2021 and to continue working through episodes 9=
 -16 right after episode 8 production. Below
 is a rough timeline of the elements involved in production of each episode=
s. We anticipate production of episodes 9 through 16 to commence right afte=
r production of episode 8 and potentially through Q1 of 2022. NYT and Accen=
ture=E2=80=99s plan is to work with you
 and Elise on availability to schedule in hosts services for the episodes. =
Notes in red are from NYT production.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Regarding payment:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You=E2=80=99ve received the first 2 of 3 payments for episodes 1 =E2=
=80=93 8. The final payment to be issued after host services of episode 8.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You=E2=80=99ve received the first of three Option Term payment. The se=
cond payment will be issued after episode 9 host services are complete. The=
 third payment will be issued after episode 16 host service are complete. T=
his is a change to the earlier milestone of
 host services complete instead of air dates. =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For next steps, can you let us know what potential unavailability you =
may have coming up over the next several months so we can take that into co=
nsideration. Once you respond, I=E2=80=99ll likely loop in the NYT since th=
ey are managing production timelines.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Please let us know if you have any questions and thank you!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best, Oscar<br>
