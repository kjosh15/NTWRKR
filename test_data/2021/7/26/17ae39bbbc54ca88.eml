Cameron, please meet Sina, the genius founder of Nayya. He's looking to
fill some roles so of course I said he had to talk to you.

Sina, Cameron is well more than a useful recruiting contact; I strongly
suggest spending a bit of time to understand his platform to see how else
he could be useful to you as you grow.

I wish you both all the best!
- J
