Thanks to you both for helping me find the crowbox components. It was so
good to see the school again!!

Josh, you and I spoke briefly about an empathy project framed around
superheroes that a friend put together. Did you want to pass on this info
to the teacher who is using superheroes as a theme to see if they'd like to
collaborate on it?

More info here: https://supersecret.info/

Otherwise, the offer still stands if you need any tech insight or help.
We're not back in NYC yet, but we're still big fans of the school. Keep us
posted!

All best,
Josh
