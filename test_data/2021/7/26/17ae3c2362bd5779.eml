Thanks again for the call today; you both asked very useful questions and I
appreciate the feedback! I spoke to my cofounder about asking users about
employee's specific pledges and we're excited to see what the impact would
be - this is exactly the kind of analytics we think our platform is
uniquely well suited for.

I've attached both our overview deck and an integrations/pricing sheet -
this ought to head off any IT questions you get about what's required (and
we can talk about our recent ISO 27001 certification if IT Security gets
uppity!) Additionally, you can check out our brief overview video here
<http://indigometrics.com>.

Tinisha, as noted we're willing to waive our setup fee given the potential
for a quick move to scaled deployment company-wide. Let's get an idea of
what the actual pilot size would be (based on EC member interest) before we
talk about pilot SaaS pricing more specifically; in the meantime the
attached lists our standard rates.

Let me know if I can answer any further questions or provide any additional
material. I'm excited to see what we can do together!

All best,
Josh
