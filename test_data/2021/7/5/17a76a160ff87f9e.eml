Amazing!!! Thanks so much for this; super on point. Had a couple calls w/
Zach and am hoping to schedule another shortly to figure out potential next
steps. The Icelandic gov't seems quite interested, and my brother in law
runs most of the geothermal energy for the biggest energy producer here,
Landsvirkjun - it looks like they're keen to do large-scale production next
to some of their plants. So far everything is looking very promising. Want
me to keep you in the loop?
