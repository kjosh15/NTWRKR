I wish I had more insight into the actual economics here; for example, I
know that spray seeding has a generally low success rate for trees, but no
idea how that compares to drone-planted seed-pods. There's so much
obfuscation off the back of technoutopianism it's difficult to useful
debate anything - although I expect your view on drones and planting
generally are probably correct.

How're things going in your world? Prep for departure from politics
proceeding apace?
