Thanks Claire!

Given the roles you're looking to measure, we'd like to make sure they have
enough overlap to make meaningful measurements; we find that senior roles
tend to quickly reject inquiry if they are requested to review someone they
don't actually interact with much.

With this group it's likely that most will be fine, but that some may have
very limited  overlap. In cases like this email proximity will be key as
senior roles often see varied network coverage outside the org chart.

Is it possible for you to give us access to your Exchange data so we can
validate interaction rates across the requested sample? Depending on
results we may suggest a different structure to ensure you have enough
peer-to-peer data at the outset.

Happy to hop on a call if that is more expedient!

Much obliged,
Josh
