Those are some great initiatives!

Here in NZ we are enjoying sane public policy and a largely COVID-free
time. Hopefully the vaccine rollout beats the next iteration of the virus.

I'm leading a new OSINT team in New Zealand Police. I set it up in 2019
while on secondment and have now taken a full time role at Police to
continue running it.

I am concurrently leading a project supported by the digital innovation
find of our Department of Internal Affairs to set up and run The Whakaars,
an Open Source Hub - basically a co-working space for government staff who
work open source. The goal is to spread good tradecraft, ethical
collection, and to advance the public debate around intelligence collection
and investigation on the Internet (we believe based on some light studies
(so far) that the public has a far better understanding of the issues than
the press, academics, or government staff believe and we want to tease out
the nuance (see a study on cover by Olivia CLEAVER)).
