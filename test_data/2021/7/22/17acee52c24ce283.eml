I have to believe that Margaret can tell you what you can and can't say.  I
might have been the most boring interview the guy ever had.  Stuck to
publicly known and defensible stuff and abstract theory. The interviewer
was a little hobbled by the fact that he doesn't really deal in game world.

Obviously, he wants something exciting.  Giving him exciting stuff isn't
necessarily in our best interest.

Great to hear that Iceland is working out for you.  Better than being in
California, that's for damn sure.
This place is *burning down*.
*Drying up* (drought), locking up (of course there are 28 recalls going on)=
.
*Dumbing down* (teachers never want to go back to work),
*Blacking Out* (though we're literally stealing power from Arizona to make
up for shortfalls.  Unfortunately, Hydroelectric doesn't work in droughts,
solar doesn't work at night and wind only works when the santa annas are
kicking up forest fires.
*Boarding up:*  Failed businesses and riots.  Not to mention the stores
that are closing because shoplifting is now legal.
*Emptying out*;  Taxpayers leaving in droves.
*Gunning down: * record crime and murder rates.

And so on.  So be thankful for Iceland.

Other than that, things are going well. I'm at a company called Deviation
right now.  Its a new developer and we made what is probably the best deal
anybody has ever made with Sony.  The guys behind it did Call of Duty,
Black Ops, Zombies, etc.  They're creating a superteam. Its like being
asked to join Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
be in Oceans 15 or some other supergroup.

Kids are great.  Zane graduated.  Is researching for DARPA, writing novels
for the Ex Publisher of Marvel Comics, doing business plans for some tech
group and mostly, believe-it-or-not polishing his World of Warcraft game.
I'm not making this up.,  We think SHARP 2008 was non-influential. It
influenced him.  He one shot killed the dragon we all died fighting outside
of Darkshire the other night.

Gwynna is in art college in Rhode Island at a place called RISD. Takes
literature at Brown.

Terrie and I are just kind of rolling through life trying not to notice
that we're not in our 30's anymore.

You should get on one of these SHARP zooms that Brad Sweet has been doing.

Otherwise, we can just chat.

Flint
