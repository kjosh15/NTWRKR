Perfect, thanks Flint. I can pass on Mr. looking-for-something-interesting.

And it sounds like I can pass on CA, too - Iceland is cold and dark all
winter, but ffs at least they managed to get everyone vaccinated in a
timely fashion. As I like to tell my wife, when the world is pandemic-class
exciting it=E2=80=99s nice to have somewhere boring to be.

Deviation sounds awesome!! Let me know if I can ever be of help to you over
there: most of my work these days is in applying my past work around using
data for influence to craft surreptitious behavior change leveraging the
social contract in new ways inside organizations=E2=80=A6 and omfg the shit=
 really
works. Companies have no idea whatsoever how fast employee behavior is
going to evolve once the basic levers are inculcated more broadly=E2=80=A6 =
Let me
know if DAO-led AI-generated corporate culture cults are interesting
thematics for you!

Zero surprise about your kids. I spoke at RISD; curious how she likes it?

And Flint, nobody=E2=80=99s 30=E2=80=99s were as interesting as now is. ;)
