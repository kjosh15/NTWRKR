Thanks, Margaret! Glad to hear you=E2=80=99re doing well and have an exit t=
arget.
No surprise about your fighting condition - I=E2=80=99ve always maintained =
there=E2=80=99s
nobody I=E2=80=99d rather fight less.

I don=E2=80=99t know what happened last time; I don=E2=80=99t want to dredg=
e up bad
memories but would appreciate the insights if you=E2=80=99re ok sharing.

For now we=E2=80=99re staying in Iceland. My startup (indigometrics.com) is=
 growing
fast and with a fully virtual team, plus my kids are enjoying country life
and unrestricted schooling so why mess with success?

Actually, if you had any suggestions on gov=E2=80=99t clients that would be
interesting=E2=80=A6 Even if it=E2=80=99s just to confirm my suspicion that=
 it=E2=80=99s not worth
it (in terms of time and effort.) Our platform is creating some really
significant impact around diversity and inclusion and we=E2=80=99re startin=
g to see
bigger effects in diminishing corruption, bullying, and the like. There=E2=
=80=99s
more, but I=E2=80=99ll spare you the sales pitch for now. ;)

Again, glad you and yours are well. Keep me posted and let me know if you=
=E2=80=99d
like to hop on a call sometime!

- J
