Sweets,

Can you help me think through this?

I did some digging and learned more about our shipping options - which is
that the size of the box matters a lot. For example, on Aug 27, 2020 we
shipped five boxes:

20x20x16, 29 lbs
20x20x16, 33 lbs
20x20x16, 37 lbs
20x20x16, 53 lbs
19x14x7, 19lbs

for a total of $616.19. If you put those same size/weights in now you get a
quote of $663.45, which isn't that much more.

The boxes we have are - based on our Amazon order - are 20x20x15.

If I filled three of them at 50lbs each the quote comes to $467.22. If I
did two, it comes to $311.48.

By way of comparison, right now I have one 50lb bag free from NYC -> KEF,
and then $30 more for KEF -> AKR.

After that, it's $90/box ($60 int'l airfare + $30 domestic) not counting
the cost of the luggage or the taxi to get it from KEF or the bus station
to the domestic airport.

I think a good game plan might be to ship two boxes and get an army/navy
duffle and check it. That brings our costs to ~$340 ($311 shipping + $30
for the domestic check in).

If I were to try to bring the same as checked it'd be ~$320 ($30 for the
first box' domestic flight, $180 for the next two boxes check-in int'l and
domestic, and ~$110 for two large luggages), plus whatever the costs to get
it from the bus station or airport to the domestic station.

That's my thinking at the moment. Let me know if my math is good, if you
have any other ideas, and/or anything else to help clarify all this!

xoxoxo,
Josh

P.S. None of the above includes the glass swans, I'm afraid, and I haven't
gone through all the paperwork Matt and Weena are holding for us yet. So
all of the above is TBD. Still, it's starting to get clearer!
