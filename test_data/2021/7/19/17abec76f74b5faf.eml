Got it, thanks! Sorry for the slow turnaround on my end; I=E2=80=99m cleari=
ng out
my family=E2=80=99s old apartment and trying to say goodbye to friends and =
do
business mtgs at the same time=E2=80=A6

I read through the brief and it sounds ideal. There are any number of ways
I could approach being a reference depending on who else you think they
might call. What do you think would benefit you most?

I.e., I cannot speak to the at-scale executive experience personally, but
have certainly consulted to a significant number of leaders in that type of
role across a variety of industries. Similarly, from an innovation
perspective I come from a different background (hacker?) and could suggest
a practical, market-facing insight on your side that isn=E2=80=99t availabl=
e
elsewhere.

Again, I don=E2=80=99t know this audience or what is likely to impress them=
, but am
keen to leverage my potentially different profile in highlighting
new/better aspects of your skill sets. Let me know if you have any insights
or suggestions!

All best,
Josh
