Thanks, Dhinuka! Glad to hear your new place is treating you well, and come
by Iceland anytime!

For March 2021 I=E2=80=99d suggest:

- Data-led culture: distributed workforces, faster innovation cycles, and
reconfigured supply chains are all putting significant pressure on data to
drive value from corporate assets. But at the same time, the Great
Resignation is putting massive new pressure on employers to produce equity
in the workforce.

These trends are on a collision course as data is being collected - and
used - at a breakneck pace. I=E2=80=99d like to give several case studies o=
n how
this has worked badly (in terms of privacy, churn, conduct risk, and PR) as
well as how organizations can approach their rich new data ecosystem to
create cumulative, agile, human-centric value.

- ESG as KPI: activist investors, informed and motivated consumers, and
extremely dynamic market conditions are shifting how companies measure and
create value in some big ways - but so far we=E2=80=99ve only seen the tip =
of the
iceberg. Come hear  how ESG is a lens not only for your PR and Reporting
strategies, but also your Innovation and Technology plans.

- The Permeable Organization: the pandemic disrupted supply chains,
accelerated innovation initiatives, and enabled a sea-change in consumer
behavior. Organizations that were able to quickly integrate outside assets
through licensing, partnerships, JVs, and M&A have been fast outpacing
their competitors and will continue to do so. The more an organization can
enable this free-flow of capacity into and out of their structures the
better they are able to take advantage of the new dynamism markets now
demand, but this is no easy feat. Come learn what new best practices are
for success in a very different commercial world.

Do any of those appeal?

All best,
Josh
