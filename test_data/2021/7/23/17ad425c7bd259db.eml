I'm a localist and an anti-monopolist, so I've been thinking for a few year=
s about the how's and why's of breaking up Big Tech via anti-monopoly legis=
lation. It's because I've been pondering the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of ho=
w to break up Big Tech and then cap its size, that I've lately come to real=
ize that the entire *aaS application stack is about to get massively disrup=
ted in a very specific and under-appreciated way by the blockchain.

Every web-scale software player, from small B2B IaaS products to big consum=
er-facing SaaS megaplatforms (Facebook, Google, Amazon), is about to get it=
s eggs scrambled.

Here's what's coming: the public blockchain amounts to a single, massive us=
ers table for the entire Internet, and the next wave of distributed applica=
tions will be built on top of it. This has all kinds of market and politica=
l implications that I'm just now starting to get my head around.

Why the users table matters
As a society, we realized a long time ago that if we let banking go entirel=
y unregulated, then we end up with these mammoth, rickety entities that lur=
ch from crisis to crisis and drag us all down with them. So when we set abo=
ut putting regulatory limits on banks, we used a few simple, difficult-to-g=
ame numbers that we could use as proxies for size and systemic risk.

While there's still plenty of debate about what these numbers =E2=80=94 e.g=
=2E, tier 1 capital ratio [https://www.i=
nvestopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-capita=
l-ratio.asp], total assets, total revenues, etc. =E2=80=94 really tell us a=
bout a bank's overall systemic risk, the fact that we have some key numeric=
al targets for regulation is what once made it possible for us to limit Big=
 Finance back in the bygone era when we used to think it was important to d=
o that.

What would an equivalent size number for a social network or other *aaS pro=
duct be? I think the answer is clearly the size of the platform's users tab=
le.

Every web application, from the most embryonic MVP [https://en.wikipedia.or=
g/wiki/Minimum_viable_product] all the way up to Google, has a table called=
 users (very few apps might give it a different name) whose job it is to ho=
ld the information that lets users log into and use the software =E2=80=94 =
email address or phone number and (encrypted) password are the basic rows y=
ou'll find in this table, but you also find a ton more proprietary data in =
there and in linked tables.

Here=E2=80=99s how important this one table is: If you went around the righ=
t Silicon Valley neighborhood at 3 AM on a Tuesday morning knocking on door=
s at random, every product owner you managed to stir from a deep slumber co=
uld look at the clock and then immediately tell you the approximate size of=
 their users table at that moment. That's because the size of the users tab=
le is the main number everyone in the software game lives and dies by. Addi=
ng rows to your platform's users table is how you win at software.

Even if your users are registering via a social sign-on button [https://www=
=2Eokta.com/blog/2020/08/social-login/]=20=
=E2=80=94 i.e., they sign in with Goo=
gle, Facebook, Amazon, etc. =E2=80=94 you've still got a users table with i=
nformation that lets you track users and market to them. In fact, let's lis=
t some user-facing things you can do with your users table:

 * Record app-specific details, like transaction history, reputation marker=
s (karma, badges earned, user ratings), social graph links, activity feeds,=
 etc.
 * Support ticketing
 * Account recovery
 * Marketing and remarketing [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/=
2453998?hl=3Den]

Then there are the business- and investor-facing things you can do with thi=
s data, like sell ads, raise new investment, and so on.

The most critical thing your users table does for you, though, is it gives =
you access to network effects [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network=
-effect.asp], and these network effects give you some lock-in. The more use=
rs your platform has, the more value it has to any one user (cf. Metcalfe's=
 law [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law]), and the more value =
it has to any one user, then A) the easier it is to attract new users, and =
B) the harder it is for any one user to leave (because to leave is to give =
up all that value).

So the entire online attention economy is built around proprietary users ta=
bles that different apps jealously guard and are constantly trying to grow.

This being the case, the size of this table is a direct measure of the size=
 of a tech platform. It's not a proxy measure, either. It's truly direct, b=
ecause it's literally the same number that the platforms are using internal=
ly and that partners and investors are using externally.

If you wanted to cap the size of a platform, then, you'd do things to limit=
 the size of its users table.

So if I were trying to determine if a platform is big enough to warrant reg=
ulatory intervention, I'd subpoena the integer result of this one query and=
 go from there:=20

> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
Similarly, if I were going to break up, say, Alphabet into Google and YouTu=
be components, I'd make the two companies maintain totally separate users t=
ables. I'd then forbid these two entities from accessing each other's user =
data via non-public interfaces, so that if YouTube wants to host Google use=
rs then it has to enable social logins for Google just like every other ser=
vice.

What it means that everyone has a separate users table
In the present incarnation of the web, all these separate users tables enfo=
rce a specific kind of interoperability architecture even on apps that want=
 to be fairly open with their own user data. Specifically, everyone's propr=
ietary user data sits behind an API that any third-party app has to call if=
 it wants access.

The result is a decentralized network of siloed tables connected by access-=
controlled APIs. Depending on the relationship between any two nodes in tha=
t network, they=E2=80=99ll have different kinds of access to each others=E2=
=80=99 data through this ad-hoc, decentralized system.

For a practical look at what this means, let's take the example of LinkedIn=
 [https://linkedin.com/]. If I have endorsements for JavaScript and WordPre=
ss, and I register with your new website via a LinkedIn button, your site i=
sn't automatically going to know that I have these endorsements. In order f=
or me to learn about your LinkedIn endorsements, I have to hit a LinkedIn-h=
osted API to get that information. (I=E2=80=99m not sure if LinkedIn actual=
ly exposes this data via API, but that=E2=80=99s beside the point.)

This arrangement has a few key implications:

 * I can only access the user data that LinkedIn elects to publish via its =
API.
 * LinkedIn can revoke API access for any data at any time, so it's not saf=
e for me to build a business that's premised on access to, say, LinkedIn en=
dorsement data.
 * It's also not safe for me to anger LinkedIn if I do go ahead and develop=
 a critical dependence on their endorsement data, because they may just rev=
oke my access to that data while leaving my competitors alone.
 * If something bad happens to LinkedIn, like maybe Google buys them and th=
en closes them down in typical Google fashion, then that API and all the en=
dorsements behind it are gone.
 * I will never be able to write my own endorsements to LinkedIn=E2=80=99s =
tables for others to see unless Linked gives me write access to that table.=
 And again, if it does then I can still lose that access because it was rev=
oked (for everyone or just for me) or because LinkedIn is gone.

The bottom line of the above points is: LinkedIn=E2=80=99s ongoing control =
of its proprietary endorsement data gives that company leverage over all us=
ers of that data, and it gives all users of that data exposure to various L=
inkedIn-specific business risks.

This combination of leverage and risk exposure massively constrains every e=
ntrepreneur's ability to build their applications in ways that depend on da=
ta LinkedIn is curating.

More generally speaking, the pervasive leverage/risk dynamics that swirl ar=
ound the users tables of the tech megaplatforms are the dark matter that gi=
ves shape to all the visible aspects of the Internet as we currently experi=
ence it.

When that dark matter disappears, everything is going to fly apart.

The blockchain as the Internet's users table
I don't want to get into a bunch of detail on how the blockchain can use pu=
blic key cryptography to form what is, in effect, a public users table that=
 operates at Internet scale. But not only is this possible, it's already be=
ing done. Maybe in a later post I can drill down on this.

In place of a decentralized network of user data silos connected by APIs, t=
here=E2=80=99s a single decentralized user data store accessible via an ope=
n protocol and a decentralized network of storage nodes. So the identity-ho=
sting blockchain represents decentralization at the datastore implementatio=
n layer, and recentralization at the datastore access layer.

I=E2=80=99ll use BitClout [https://bitclout.com/]=E2=80=99s blockchain as a=
n example of what I'm talking about because I=E2=80=99ve been thinking abou=
t it a lot lately for various reasons. But I could use others, as well.

So with BitClout, I have an identity [https://bitclout.com/u/jonstokes] on =
that blockchain that's publicly accessible to anyone running an open-source=
 BitClout node. To continue with the example of LinkedIn, if they were to r=
ebuild themselves on top of BitClout, and they were to write their entire u=
sers table along with all its endorsements to the BitClout blockchain, then=
 that data would be there for every other BitClout node to read or append t=
o.

If anything were to happen to LinkedIn or to its internal assessment of the=
 value of providing public endorsement data on-chain, the public would stil=
l have unfettered, permanent access to the old data. Furthermore, I could e=
asily stand up a service that lets BitClout users (who are also LinkedIn us=
ers now) continue to endorse each other for various skills under my own ide=
ntity, and I could even add a new skill and endorsement options that others=
 could recognize (or ignore) alongside LinkedIn's.

Sure, LinkedIn could continue to keep its endorsement data off-chain behind=
 a proprietary API even if its users table was effectively the BitClout blo=
ckchain. But a decision to keep data siloed this way is a decision to foreg=
o on-chain network effects for that data. My guess is that the temptation t=
o take advantage of blockchain-sized network effects will be so great, that=
 companies will default to putting data on-chain rather than keeping it sil=
oed.

This point about network effects is why people will build things using on-c=
hain identities. It's so critical that I'm going to blockquote what I just =
wrote about network effects above, so you can read it again:

> The most critical thing your users table does for you, though, is it give=
s you access to network effects [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netwo=
rk-effect.asp], and these network effects give you some lock-in. The more u=
sers your platform has, the more value it has to any one user (cf. Metcalfe=
's law [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law]), and the more valu=
e it has to any one user, then A) the easier it is to attract new users, an=
d B) the harder it is for any one user to leave (because to leave is to giv=
e up all that value).
Imagine that LinkedIn, Reddit, and Github all port their users tables (alon=
g with much of their proprietary data, like endorsements, karma, and activi=
ty history) to BitClout. Immediately, here's what happens: every Github use=
r is also a Reddit user and a LinkedIn user and a BitClout user. Likewise, =
every Reddit user is also a Github user and a LinkedIn user and a BitClout =
user. I could go on, but you get the point.

Every company that builds on the same virtual users table has immediate acc=
ess to the network effects of every other startup on that table. Every time=
 an on-chain company onboards a new user, then your service has a new user,=
 as well. (In a manner of speaking. They may not be actively using your ser=
vice yet, but they effectively have an account on it.)

Conversely, users-table-based network effects cease being an economic moat =
[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp] that can giv=
e anyone any kind of defensible or investable edge.

The game theory of this arrangement is as follows:

 1. All of the big incumbents will want to keep their users tables propriet=
ary in the beginning, because that's their moat and it gives them the netwo=
rk effects and lock-in that markets and investors reward them for.
 2. At some point, though, the blockchain users table (plus the ecosystem b=
uilt on it) will grow to the size where incumbents can't compete on their o=
wn. When BitClout's virtual users table has surpassed, say, Twitter's propr=
ietary users table in size, then Twitter will either join the blockchain or=
 get left behind. And likewise on up the size leaderboards until we get to =
Google and Facebook.
 3. Eventually, there will be a blockchain users table that's bigger than t=
he next two or three proprietary users tables combined. When that happens, =
the megaplatforms will either ditch their proprietary tables and reconfigur=
e their businesses around the chain, or they'll enter a doom loop.

Imagine a world where every startup begins life with as many users as the l=
argest incumbent. There's no on-boarding or sign-up friction =E2=80=94 at l=
east friction isn=E2=80=99t mandatory as it is now (you could reintroduce i=
t). If you're built on the big identity blockchain, then every blockchain w=
allet is already a (inactive) user of your service who has a seamless way t=
o transact with you for money and digital goods.

It will cost companies some money to reach their users and flip them from i=
nactive to active for their particular service. I think there will definite=
ly be paid inboxes on any chain that's going to survive because otherwise S=
PAM will make the whole thing unusable. But companies can query the chain, =
identify a subset of users to target, and then target them or service them =
in whatever way they can afford.

If you want to build a set of network effects that benefit your company spe=
cifically, it won't be enough to simply cultivate a large users table or em=
ail list =E2=80=94 no, you'll have to offer something on-chain that others =
are also incentivized to use, so that the thing you're uniquely offering sp=
reads and becomes a kind of currency.

For example, if I'm the only one offering a particular credential (e.g., us=
er verification, like Twitter Verified but on-chain), then the more users e=
mploy that credential in their transactions the larger my on-chain network =
is.

How would I, the credential provider get value from this? I dunno, but it's=
 not too hard to come up with random possibilities. For instance, if you ac=
cept my credential then maybe you have to accept marketing messages from me=
 at some steep discount to your normal inbox rate; I can either use this di=
scounted access directly or resell it. That's one example I just randomly t=
hought up, and I'm just one dude =E2=80=94 I'm sure the market will come up=
 with a lot more.

The bottom line: Moving identity on-chain, and thereby removing the possibi=
lity of users-table-centric network effects, completely up-ends the entire =
landscape of API-based, access-controlled interoperability that the present=
 Internet is built on. All of the non-technical market and political dynami=
cs around users table size, leverage, and risk suddenly go out the window.

I don't know what the results will look like, but I'm pretty sure it will b=
e unrecognizable to us right now. There are whole conversations we're curre=
ntly having around tech consolidation and censorship that won't even make s=
ense in a single-users-table world.

To put it another way, there=E2=80=99s now another large, growing entity on=
 the scene in addition to the government that can face off against Big Tech=
 and break it up by force. Of course, the government may try to murder that=
 entity before it not only gets big enough to do in Big Tech, but then it t=
urns its monopoly-busting powers on the government itself.

ve been thinking for a few years about the how&#39;s and why&#39;s of break=
ing up Big Tech via anti-monopoly legislation. It&#39;s because I&#39;ve be=
en pondering the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of how to break up Big Tech and t=
hen cap its size, that I&#39;ve lately come to realize that the entire *aaS=
 application stack is about to get massively disrupted in a very specific a=

m 0; line-height: 1.6em;"><strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;">Here&#39;s wh=
at&#39;s coming</strong>: the public blockchain amounts to a single, massiv=
e <em>users</em> table for the entire Internet, and the next wave of distri=
buted applications will be built on top of it. This has all kinds of market=
 and political implications that I&#39;m just now starting to get my head a=
round.</p><h2 id=3D"why-the-users-table-matters" style=3D"margin-top: 0; fo=

0; line-height: 1.6em;">As a society, we realized a long time ago that if w=
e let banking go entirely unregulated, then we end up with these mammoth, r=
ickety entities that lurch from crisis to crisis and drag us all down with =
them. So when we set about putting regulatory limits on banks, we used a fe=
w simple, difficult-to-game numbers that we could use as proxies for size a=
nd systemic risk.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">=
While there&#39;s still plenty of debate about what these numbers &#x2014; =
e.g., <a href=3D"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-capital-ratio.=
asp" style=3D"color: #08121A; text-decoration: underline;" target=3D"_blank=
">tier 1 capital ratio</a>, total assets, total revenues, etc. &#x2014; rea=
lly tell us about a bank&#39;s overall systemic risk, the fact that we have=
 some key numerical targets for regulation is what once made it possible fo=
r us to limit Big Finance back in the bygone era when we used to think it w=
as important to do that.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1=
=2E6em;">What would an equivalent size n=
umber for a social network or other *=
aaS product be? I think the answer is clearly the size of the platform&#39;=
s <em>users</em> table.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.=
6em;">Every web application, from the most embryonic <a href=3D"https://en.=
wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" style=3D"color: #08121A; text-de=
coration: underline;" target=3D"_blank">MVP</a> all the way up to Google, h=
as a table called <em>users</em> (very few apps might give it a different n=
ame) whose job it is to hold the information that lets users log into and u=
se the software &#x2014; email address or phone number and (encrypted) pass=
word are the basic rows you&#39;ll find in this table, but you also find a =
ton more proprietary data in there and in linked tables.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">Here&#x2019;s how important this one=
 table is: If you went around the right Silicon Valley neighborhood at 3 AM=
 on a Tuesday morning knocking on doors at random, every product owner you =

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law" style=3D"color: #08121A; te=

he more value it has to any one user, then A) the easier it is to attract n=

height: 1.6em;">So the <strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;">entire online at=

that different apps jealously guard and are constantly trying to grow.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">This being the case, t=
he size of this table is a direct measure of the size of a tech platform. I=
t&#39;s not a proxy measure, either. It&#39;s truly direct, because it&#39;=
s literally the same number that the platforms are using internally and tha=
t partners and investors are using externally.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1=

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">So if I were trying t=

 I&#39;d subpoena the integer result of this one query and go from there: <=

ble</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">In the presen=
t incarnation of the web, all these separate <em>users</em> tables enforce =
a specific kind of interoperability architecture even on apps that want to =
be fairly open with their own user data. Specifically, everyone&#39;s propr=
ietary user data sits behind an API that any third-party app has to call if=
 it wants access.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">=
The result is a decentralized network of siloed tables connected by access-=
controlled APIs. Depending on the relationship between any two nodes in tha=
t network, they&#x2019;ll have different kinds of access to each others&#x2=
019; data through this ad-hoc, decentralized system.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">For a practical look at what this means,=
 let&#39;s take the example of <a href=3D"https://linkedin.com/" style=3D"c=
olor: #08121A; text-decoration: underline;" target=3D"_blank">LinkedIn</a>.=
 If I have endorsements for JavaScript and WordPress, and I register with y=
our new website via a LinkedIn button, your site isn&#39;t automatically go=
ing to know that I have these endorsements. In order for me to learn about =
your LinkedIn endorsements, I have to hit a LinkedIn-hosted API to get that=
 information. (I&#x2019;m not sure if LinkedIn actually exposes this data v=
ia API, but that&#x2019;s beside the point.)</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5=
em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">This arrangement has a few key implications:</p>=
<ul style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 1.3em; =
padding-right: 1.5em; list-style: disc; max-width: 100%;"><li style=3D"marg=
in: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 0.3em; line-height: 1.6em;">I can only access th=
e user data that <strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;">LinkedIn elects to pub=
lish</strong> via its API.</li><li style=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: =
0.3em; line-height: 1.6em;">LinkedIn can <strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;=
">revoke API access</strong> for any data at any time, so it&#39;s not safe=
 for me to build a business that&#39;s premised on access to, say, LinkedIn=
 endorsement data.</li><li style=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 0.3em; l=
ine-height: 1.6em;">It&#39;s also not safe for me to <strong style=3D"font-=
weight: 700;">anger LinkedIn</strong> if I do go ahead and develop a critic=
al dependence on their endorsement data, because they may just revoke <em>m=
y</em> access to that data while leaving my competitors alone.</li><li styl=
e=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 0.3em; line-height: 1.6em;">If somethin=
g bad happens to LinkedIn, like maybe Google buys them and then <strong sty=
le=3D"font-weight: 700;">closes them down</strong> in typical Google fashio=
n, then that API and all the endorsements behind it are gone.</li><li style=
=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 0.3em; line-height: 1.6em;">I will never=
 be able to <strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;">write my own endorsements</=
strong> to LinkedIn&#x2019;s tables for others to see unless Linked gives m=
e write access to that table. And again, if it does then I can still lose t=
hat access because it was revoked (for everyone or just for me) or because =
LinkedIn is gone.</li></ul><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.=
6em;">The bottom line of the above points is: LinkedIn&#x2019;s ongoing con=
trol of its proprietary endorsement data gives that company <em>leverage</e=
m> over all users of that data, and it gives all users of that data <em>exp=
osure</em> to various LinkedIn-specific business risks.</p><p style=3D"marg=

s in ways that depend on data LinkedIn is curating.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">More generally speaking, the pervasive le=
verage/risk dynamics that swirl around the <em>users</em> tables of the tec=

rong> that gives shape to all the visible aspects of the Internet as we cur=
rently experience it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6e=

y to form what is, in effect, a public <em>users</em> table that operates a=
t Internet scale. But not only is this possible, it&#39;s already being don=
e. Maybe in a later post I can drill down on this.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">In place of a decentralized network of use=
r data silos connected by APIs, there&#x2019;s a single decentralized user =
data store accessible via an open protocol and a decentralized network of s=
torage nodes. So the identity-hosting blockchain represents decentralizatio=
n at the datastore implementation layer, and recentralization at the datast=
ore access layer.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">=
I&#x2019;ll use <a href=3D"https://bitclout.com/" style=3D"color: #08121A; =
text-decoration: underline;" target=3D"_blank">BitClout</a>&#x2019;s blockc=

hinking about it a lot lately for various reasons. But I could use others, =
as well.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">So with B=
itClout, <a href=3D"https://bitclout.com/u/jonstokes" style=3D"color: #0812=

n that blockchain that&#39;s publicly accessible to anyone running an open-=
source BitClout node. To continue with the example of LinkedIn, if they wer=
e to rebuild themselves on top of BitClout, and they were to write their en=
tire users table along with all its endorsements to the BitClout blockchain=
, then that data would be there for every other BitClout node to read or ap=
pend to.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">If anythi=
ng were to happen to LinkedIn or to its internal assessment of the value of=
 providing public endorsement data on-chain, the public would still have un=
fettered, permanent access to the old data. Furthermore, I could easily sta=
nd up a service that lets BitClout users (who are also LinkedIn users now) =
continue to endorse each other for various skills under my own identity, an=
d I could even add a new skill and endorsement options that others could re=
cognize (or ignore) alongside LinkedIn&#39;s.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.=
5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">Sure, LinkedIn could continue to keep its endor=
sement data off-chain behind a proprietary API even if its <em>users</em> t=
able was effectively the BitClout blockchain. But a decision to keep data s=
iloed this way is a decision to forego on-chain network effects for that da=
ta. My guess is that the temptation to take advantage of blockchain-sized n=
etwork effects will be so great, that <strong style=3D"font-weight: 700;">c=
ompanies will default to putting data on-chain</strong> rather than keeping=
 it siloed.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">This p=
oint about network effects is why people will build things using on-chain i=
dentities. It&#39;s so critical that I&#39;m going to blockquote what I jus=

uote><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">Imagine that Lin=
kedIn, Reddit, and Github all port their <em>users</em> tables (along with =
much of their proprietary data, like endorsements, karma, and activity hist=
ory) to BitClout. Immediately, here&#39;s what happens: every Github user i=
s <em>also</em> a Reddit user and a LinkedIn user and a BitClout user. Like=
wise, every Reddit user is <em>also</em> a Github user and a LinkedIn user =
and a BitClout user. I could go on, but you get the point.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">Every company that builds on the s=
ame virtual <em>users</em> table has immediate access to the network effect=
s of every other startup on that table. Every time an on-chain company onbo=
ards a new user, then your service has a new user, as well. (In a manner of=
 speaking. They may not be actively using your service yet, but they effect=
ively have an account on it.)</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-heig=

d investors reward them for.</li><li style=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left=
: 0.3em; line-height: 1.6em;">At some point, though, the blockchain <em>use=
rs</em> table (plus the ecosystem built on it) will grow to the size where =
incumbents can&#39;t compete on their own. When BitClout&#39;s virtual <em>=
users</em> table has surpassed, say, Twitter&#39;s proprietary <em>users</e=
m> table in size, then Twitter will either join the blockchain or get left =
behind. And likewise on up the size leaderboards until we get to Google and=
 Facebook.</li><li style=3D"margin: 0.5em 0; padding-left: 0.3em; line-heig=

tables and reconfigure their businesses around the chain, or they&#39;ll en=
ter a doom loop.</li></ol><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6=

the largest incumbent. There&#39;s no on-boarding or sign-up friction &#x20=
14; at least friction isn&#x2019;t mandatory as it is now (you <em>could</e=

has a seamless way to transact with you for money and digital goods.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">It will cost companies s=
ome money to reach their users and flip them from inactive to active for th=
eir particular service. I think there will definitely be paid inboxes on an=
y chain that&#39;s going to survive because otherwise SPAM will make the wh=

 can afford.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.6em;">If yo=

ties. For instance, if you accept my credential then maybe you have to acce=
pt marketing messages from me at some steep discount to your normal inbox r=
