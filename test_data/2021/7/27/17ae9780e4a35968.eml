Hiya!

Great question and good timing: here's that reel
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q8XwneoYCLD0hAlS0GIa16X7p4fuB_Zk/view> :)

If you have tape from other sources (talks, panels) we could possibly work
that in, but I think it's sounding nice just using Built for Change tape,
and it captures a nice range of Josh Kleinness.

Cheers,
Whitney

 I&#39;m working on a TV show pitch with Jaron Lanier, Chief Technology and=
 Officer Prime Unifying Scientist at Microsoft. I bet he&#39;d know exactly=
 who to talk to at Microsoft about pitching a Future of Work show, and may =
even be willing to endorse it. They don&#39;t have anything in this space s=
pecifically, but do have a pretty big department focused on the topic. I al=
so have Jordan Harbinger&#39;s agent who is tied into them so we could subm=
it through multiple angles at once. <br><br>2. I can go to the following co=
mpanies (all very large) if you can help me qualify any of them:<br>	Blackr=
ock<br>	HP<br>	Verizon<br>	Workday<br>	Google<br>	Mastercard<br>	Motorola<b=
r>	IDEO<br>	Walmart<br>	Amazon<br><br>3. Crunchbase has a list of ~1000 rec=
ently funded, Small-to-Medium sized businesses sortable by the size of thei=
r recent raise. We could use this to make a list to pull targets from to fu=
rther qualify for outreach:<br><br><a href=3D"https://www.crunchbase.com/hu=

hbase.com/hub/small-and-medium-businesses-startups</a><br><br>Let me know i=
f doing this sort of more scaled approach to targeting makes sense to you. =
In the meantime I am continuing to push W50. <br><br>Otherwise, it seems li=
ke we could start with a direct pitch for a Future of Work podcast pitch to=
 Microsoft via Jaron and Jordan, and then try to formalize a qualification =
process for the second and third options while it progresses so we&#39;re r=
eady to send a more bulk email when the show hits. Or none or some of those=
 options. What do you think?<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a c=
orporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all development (creative), =
research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production,=
 post-production and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the=

varies. However, I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work=
 together to build and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves=
 the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and wil=
l be given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. =
Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics,=
 including: development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booki=
ng, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<b=
r>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: F=
or our production services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#=
39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on a coupl=
e different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the cli=
ents put together a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize toge=
ther on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily c=
ompetitive, so it requires another budget for distribution and marketing. T=
hat said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s onl=
y distributed to members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super s=
imple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long story short, we are=
n&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented company. Might be =
good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times,=
 JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell W=
illiams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <=

&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad we spoke the other day - I think I have a really g=
ood lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former ed=
itor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;r=
e that group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; =
They recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#3=
9;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc.=
 etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leade=
rs from each group to create a series of insights to share across all the g=
roups and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of th=
ing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was much more practical than=
 what he had considered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts)=
.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a b=
ig restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to=
 media is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this interna=
lly, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk =
that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources. (Although I thin=
k this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitchin=
g to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pag=
er and Adam said that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m spea=
king to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked=
 closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<=
br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough prici=
ng (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and=
 some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<=

t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S.=
 Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work t=
hat would be required to interface with each group, decide on topics, coord=
inate with the representatives and members of each group to do interviews, =
etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I fla=
