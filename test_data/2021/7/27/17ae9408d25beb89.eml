One other quick thought; do you know if anyone at Discover is doing a
business podcast? I recently hosted a large general business podcast
("Built for Change") for Accenture and the NY Times and it strikes me that
the innovation you're doing over there might be well received!

Let me know if either that or Kate Manfred and interesting topics.

All best wishes,
Josh
