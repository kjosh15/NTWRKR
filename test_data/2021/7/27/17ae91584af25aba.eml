Thanks again for a fabulous dinner last week; it was super helpful to meet =
the whole team in person and got me even more excited about the potential f=
or this content!!<br>
<br>
Aside from shooting in a hot spring here in Iceland I was particularly inte=
rested in the potential for migrating this content to other media, such as =
video, cross-platform, etc.<br>
<br>
I also really appreciated your comments about the work that Accenture Labs =
are doing. Entirely separate from the podcast I&#39;ve been talking with Sa=
ideep Raj, your global Senior Managing Director for Innovation, who helped =
me get some insight into its breadth
 and potential impact. <br>
<br>
Are you available for a brief call in the next couple weeks to compare note=
s on some ideas? Ever since the dinner I&#39;ve been having &quot;Oh yeah, =
and we could...&quot; moments and I&#39;d love to get your take on what mig=
ht be actionable!<br>

All best,<br>
