Scott,

I've been loving the Icelandic startup scene during the pandemic and
recently ran across one looking for funding that I thought might be of
interest. Let me know either way so I can be sure not to send you anything
you're not after in future!

Short summary below, and one-pager attached. Let me know if you'd like an
intro!

All best,
Josh

Here is an ID from my friend Margret Juliana - a musician and many times
awarded entrepreneur/founder (Nordic EdTech Awards 2019 and one of 100
European female entrepreneurs recommended by Forbes in 2019). Margret is
currently raising funds for her new venture called Octavia - software
combined with a dynamic marketplace for online music tuition - a current
topic these days. Octavia is placed in a fast growing market, one that has
lagged for many years and now, due to Covid, moving forward at the speed of
light. Margret has gathered a team of experienced individuals in business
and software development and international digital marketing.
