Tinisha is reviewing one other vendor and will then pitch our platform to
the EC; the idea is that each EC member run a pilot with >50 employees to
prove that it can be used enterprise-wide.

If there is anyone in your team who I could speak to that might help lay
the groundwork or uncover additional opportunities to leverage the platform
I'd love to connect; we're seeing a lot of traction in a variety of areas,
and I know your team was looking at some other goals we might contribute to=
!

Thanks again for connecting me with Tinisha,
Josh
