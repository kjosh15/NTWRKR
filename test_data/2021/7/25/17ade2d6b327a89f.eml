Hey Josh!
I checked my iCloud account for the first time in months! I normally use it f=
or receiving ads etc =E2=80=94 but when I send a message on my phone I somet=
imes inadvertently use that account. So, thanks for this reply! Yes, it was a=
 cool project.

I=E2=80=99m sitting in my garden in Colorado listening to the crows calling o=
ut. It really pisses them off when I CAW back and they seem to swarm and swo=
op a bit more to get a look to find out what=E2=80=99s going on=E2=80=94 or m=
aybe they are just amused or interested.  It=E2=80=99s odd=E2=80=94- for the=
 last two summers there was not a big crow presence here.This year they are m=
aking a real racket. It has been a particularly favorable winter and spring,=
 making for an exceptionally beautiful, verdant summer=E2=80=94 wildflowers g=
alore. So I wonder if that has impacted the crows=E2=80=99 attraction to my g=
arden?

A friend recently visited Iceland and could not say enough wonderful things a=
bout the geography, the geology, the people. I=E2=80=99ll have to visit!=20

I=E2=80=99ll forward this same note from my aol account so next time we comm=
unicate you can use that one- nobody can believe I=E2=80=99ve held onto that=
 account.
