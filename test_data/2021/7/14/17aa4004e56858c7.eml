They=E2=80=99ve refused to provide email proximity info (the HR lead didn=
=E2=80=99t know
how she=E2=80=99d provide it, strangely) and have asked for:

=E2=80=9CCan you specify the two approaches and the financials attached to =
each and
also what would be required from a data perspective for each =E2=80=93 this=
 will
keep things moving=E2=80=9D

Do we have anything written on the data requirements I can include, and
what is your current thinking on pricing? Finally, for the two approaches I
think we should suggest either numerous smaller groups (focused on each
leader) or the email-proximity based grouping. Do you have an alternative
suggestion?
