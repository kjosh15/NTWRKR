Apparently I get a "startled look" whenever Hulda suggests we let Othinn do
something that didn't used to be appropriate for him. It's not that I
ultimately say no, just that I have to reorient myself that there's a new
reality and I happen to have missed it. :)

Parenting is loads of fun!!

xoxo,
Josh
