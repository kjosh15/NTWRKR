Was talking with some startup friends of mine this weekend and one said
he'd heard really good things about https://pipe.com - the idea being that
you can trade on your existing contracts to get more cash up front.
Probably not ideal for us right now (with so few large deals), but perhaps
sooner rather than later? Curious to get your take as someone with
professional banking experience.
