 Thanks for this, Richard! I'd read the semantics of fingers in this case a=
s structured around the crossing being owned by the fingers - so I guess I =
should have written in fingers' crossed, which also doesn't look correct. T=
hanks for the insight! Now if we could get people to stop using "loose" in =
place of "lose" I suspect we'd both be happier people...
I'll keep my eyes open for electric=C2=A0motorcycle companies. Harley is th=
e only one I've heard from recently, aside from the ugly one out of New Lab=
 that you didn't care for.=C2=A0
I'm very curious about these letters you send. Do you have any drafts or un=

 I don't often have the chance to appear the nerd in my business of words (=
as you do in tech), but because I'm corresponding with someone who seems in=
terested in plumbing the linguistic depths, I'll mention that crossing one'=
s fingers as a talisman of luck involves two fingers, thus the expression w=
ould be "fingers crossed," rather than "finger's crossed." Whenever you tir=

mething at the screen when we're on Zoom.=C2=A0 It was probably just a typo=

At the moment, my clients are the X2 already mentioned and Paradigm Corp, a=
 health care company that currently specializes in the gold standard of cat=

complex care through M&A, and thus wants to establish a new naming system f=
or their expanded product line.=C2=A0 Along with Mucho management, I have a=
 first meeting with JSX airline next week (I sent their CEO a provocative, =
personal letter about the future of short-haul, which prompted an appt.), a=
nd another with the management of Angel City Football Club the week after t=
hat.=C2=A0 That is a new soccer club in LA that will begin playing next yea=

, and management that I've heard of in the nascent phase of any professiona=

names behind Angel City.=C2=A0=C2=A0Mucho Barcelona has handled the marketi=
ng for many of the most famous teams/players in Europe. Thus the interest o=
n our side.=C2=A0
I'd like to pursue electric motorcycles and bicycles soon, so if you know a=
nybody in that world, let me know.=C2=A0=C2=A0
My personal letters, which are researched and written with language that ma=

Since I'm also still involved in creative writing - I leave for the Sewanee=

 I'll keep looking, but I think you're right - everyone knows this is a cri=

 It's similar language across the board; the difference is that Bamboo seem=
