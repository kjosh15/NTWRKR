Super hot area, crypto - and bitcoin specifically. I'd suggest it's more
about the Level 2 networks going up to facilitate faster transaction times
(I recently did some work on NFTs with the guy who's doing all the back-end
research for the Winklevoss twins) as well as the geopolitical soft power
that country-owned currencies provide!

In terms of rates, I was charging ~$25k for an in person speech before the
pandemic, but now - depending on location - I've cut prices down to $15-20.
Let me know if that fits with their appetite!

All best wishes,
Josh
