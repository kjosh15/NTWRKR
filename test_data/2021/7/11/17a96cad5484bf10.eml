I'm trying to finalize my tax setup; if I take a salary from Indigometrics
do you know if that would that be subject to taxes and withholding in the
UK?

Similarly, I realized I don't have any copies of our corporate formation
documents, articles of organization, share ledgers, etc. Can you put those
in the GDrive folder I made last week? Just crossing t's and dotting i's.

Finally, did you want to connect prior to talking to the patent attorney
Tuesday, or are you ok just using it as a meet-and-greet? He seemed
amenable to us front-loading with ideas around anything we felt was
patentable, but with ISO I'm assuming there's no room.
