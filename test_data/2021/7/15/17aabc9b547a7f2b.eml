Hi Josh,

Always interested in what you're up to but I doubt I can offer you much in
the way of collaboration. Our only previous conversation was me pointing
out that someone had edited your Wikipedia entry to give you some
impressive anatomical features.

Business:
Presently, I make very boring (tm) information systems software for a
laboratory services company. Lately, we are retrofitting our proprietary
systems to allow for white labelling and we will be onboarding some
partners very soon. That part of my work has been quite exciting. In my
spare time I am broadening my skillset by learning about distributed
systems and making related pet projects.

Pleasure:
If you're at all into video games, Phasmophobia is some of the best
innovation I've seen in a while and might be of interest to you. What makes
Phasmo new and interesting is the careful incorporation of sound queues and
you are required to talk to the game. This renders you susceptible to
feeling spooky and to jump scares. I feel that this qualifies as the sort
of big-picture thinking you specialize in. Very often, sound is a secondary
feature to a game but in Phasmophobia it's front and center. If you care to
try it with some randos, my pals and I play most Wednesdays at 9:30 EST.


Wishing you the best,
Robert
