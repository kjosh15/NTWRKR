Thanks so much for the offer, Ritamary! We=E2=80=99re in Iceland now, unfor=
tunately
- they ended up doing much better in the pandemic and gave my kids a much
safer/saner school year. Man we miss NYC though=E2=80=A6

So so glad to hear the Wild Bird Fund survived the pandemic; I speak of it
often and will press whatever contacts I may to consider funding. Let me
know if you come over to our part of the world in the meantime!

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
