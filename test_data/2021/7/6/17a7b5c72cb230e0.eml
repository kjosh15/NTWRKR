could start with a direct pitch for a Future of Work podcast pitch to Micro=

&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corporate podcast=
 like Accenture. This includes all development (creative), research, writin=
g, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production=
 and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the level we do.<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work process, it varies. However,=
 I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work together to bui=
ld and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the World 50 au=
dience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be given oppor=
tunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is =
a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, including: deve=
lopment (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, s=
hipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our productio=
n services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#39;t even track =
numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different vend=
ors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put togethe=
r a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize together on this and=
 help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive, so i=
t requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it sou=
nds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s only distributed to=
 members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It&#39;d =
be a private link essentially. So, long story short, we aren&#39;t a data-d=
riven company, we are a service oriented company. Might be good to include =
some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase=
, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Sch=
umer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rea=
lly glad we spoke the other day - I think I have a really good lead.<br>&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chief of=
 Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re that group I&#=
39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hu=
gely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re structured =
into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each gro=
up to create a series of insights to share across all the groups and he lov=
ed it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50 had=
 been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had con=
sidered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T=
here are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructuring=
, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to media is going =
forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, and there i=
s no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll=
 try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is unlike=
ly.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them more f=
ormally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said=
 that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new =
head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with hi=
m for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wha=
t do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing (based off th=
e Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # referenc=
es for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

t;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s bigg=
est concern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that would be req=
uired to interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with the r=
epresentatives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He also ask=
ed if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all this so yo=
u can keep it in mind for pricing!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
