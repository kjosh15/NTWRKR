Karl,

Just following up. I'll be in R.vik the morning of the 15th if you're
available / a meeting would be useful.

In the meantime it looks like there are a couple independent opps growing
that I'd love your feedback on:

1. Landsvirkjun has a big interest in building gigafarms (vertical) and I'm
connecting with a number of investors and experts in the area across the
U.S. I'm curious what you see as a best case outcome here so I can steer
towards best integration on the politics front.

2. We're making inroads around education; my wife is building the
beginnings of a campaign to position Iceland as a leader in children's
education equity, using a local school (which, not coincidentally, our
children attend) as a case study. This isn't sustainability, but it is a
chance to increase Iceland's exposure around a similarly big topic. Do you
have any thoughts?

3. I've been talking to some local landowners and firms around creating
land trusts to generate carbon negative premium housing for foreign owners.
This is highly contentious, but I think also has huge opportunity if we
link it to the right structure for feeding back benefits to Iceland. I'd
really like to get your take on this before pushing it any further.

All of this is independent of the four projects we discussed. I imagine
(hope?) you're on summer vacation, so let me know if you're around on the
15th and/or when you might be able to reconnect about the above!

All best,
Josh
