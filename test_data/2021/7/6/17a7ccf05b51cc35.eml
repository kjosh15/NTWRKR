Bill,

Thanks again for the conversation earlier today - as ever, your thinking
was incisive and super useful. Some follow-ups:

- Please do intro me to the CEO of Niyya; I'd love to see how we could help
each other,

- Ditto for your Blackstone contact; I think we could prove very valuable
as a recommended value-add for their investments,

- Send me your materials and I'll run them by some close CISO friends. If I
think I can reliably convert new members for you we can talk about
formalizing something - but let me prove it first.

All best,
Josh
