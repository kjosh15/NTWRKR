Welcome to summer!! Vaccines are increasingly abundant and the world is
changing.

I'm writing as I'm still seeing growth in requests for speaking
engagements, both in person and virtual. I wanted to make sure you had my
latest information (presskit attached), speeches (3 one-pagers attached),
and video clips (at www.josh.is).

A big bump in interest has come from my co-hosting the NY Times' and
Accenture's big new business podcast, Built for Change
<https://accntu.re/3ttSJek>. It's already #15 in Apple's Management
category of all-time and rising fast, and it's being featured heavily on
The Daily and across the NY Times' platforms.

At the same time, I'm getting a lot of requests for help understanding ESG
and HR Data, Cybersecurity, and Technology Disruption generally. I'd love
to expand my reach and to share content I've been developing for many of my
Fortune 500 clients around these topics!!

Let me know if I can provide any further info. We've seen a decade's worth
of technology adoption in a single year, the invention of literally dozens
of world-changing technologies, and a massive shift in the role businesses
are expected to play in society. Let's get into it!!

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
