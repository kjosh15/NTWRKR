So cool! I'm in Iceland - similar sane public policy and largely
COVID-free. We're at 90% of the public (over 16) vaccinated and expect to
get to >98% in the next couple of weeks. I'm heading back to NYC for a
visit and admit to some trepidation!!

The Whakaars sounds amazing; I'm a big proponent of the idea of leveraging
the public for this sort of thing. Let me know if I can be of any help!!

All best,
Josh
