Hey Josh!

How are you doing?  Hope all is well with you and the fam!

Sorry for the delay but please check out our current cut for the WORLD =
CHANGING sizzle below.  This is pretty far along but not finalized yet, =
so please let us know your thoughts.

WORLD CHANGING Sizzle - RC
https://f.io/P785XIMb <https://f.io/P785XIMb> (pw: josh)

We=E2=80=99re also working on the deck as we speak, and would love some =
input from you as far as the episode ideas we=E2=80=99ve been discussing =
- WHERE specifically would these questions / stories take us, and how =
would they fit together?

Basically, pretend we get a greenlight tomorrow and they network says, =
=E2=80=9CGreat!  What are the 8 episodes?=E2=80=9D - we have 8 questions =
/ overall themes listed out in the document and that we touch on in the =
tape, but let=E2=80=99s endeavor to flesh this out a bit so that they =
can visualize it even more in the pitch. =20

This doesn't need to be super detailed, especially since we don=E2=80=99t =
have a full research team like we would in series to really track this =
stuff down - but we should bullet point the 4-5 stories that make sense =
for each overarching question, and how they could / would tie together =
over the course of the episode =E2=80=94=20

FOR EXAMPLE - We go A location first and witness X problem / innovation, =
then go to B location next and talk to Y person, before continuing on to =
C location as we see how X and Y combine or interest to help person Z =
halfway around the globe - that sort=E2=80=99ve thing.

Take some time to put down some thoughts and we can connect and chat =
later this week if that works! =20

CC=E2=80=99ing Allie to schedule a time to catch up.

Thanks Josh!
