Thanks for the update. Curious how things are shaking out for you; let me
know if you need a sounding board!

We're in discussions with four big multinationals now, any one of which
might be a good fit - but you know what sales cycles are like for
enterprise. Happy to engage with anyone on your side that might be
interested, especially if it helps arm me earlier on in the process.
Getting a pilot running inside of KPMG seems like a good first step
either way!
