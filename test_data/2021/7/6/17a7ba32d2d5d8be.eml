<div>Thanks so much! Reg. Iceland, my biggest tip is to follow the weather =
- it changes continually and often, and it&#39;s worth going to where it&#3=

circles, as locals are very approachable
 when they&#39;re not being mobbed by visitors and will give you a good ins=
ight into the actual culture and country. Hit me with an idea of the kind o=
