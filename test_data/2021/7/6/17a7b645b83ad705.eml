Te Whakaara - that's the M=C4=81ori name, because we aim for partnership ac=
ross
government here. And yes, Iceland has done well too! Good place to ride out
a zombie apocalypse too, I figure. And 90%+ is superb vaccination. We've
lagged because we have let others more in need go first, I believe.

And yes, there are a lot of talking heads who will worry about intelligence
and its impact but no one really takes the effort to talk to the public
about it (which is a side-goal of The Hub). In Cleaver's limited research
she did ask people an interesting question: Comfort around govt. agencies
using cover. She found a good variety of opinions and comfort depending on
the task at hand. It's interesting to me because the public are clearly
well aware of social media, fake accounts, and what they want their
agencies to work in those spaces (not a great surprise but good to see
captured!). This contrasts with some of the shrill commentary I see from
academics and journalists.

Unsure how we'll publicize and work this in the New Zealand setting. We
will see.
