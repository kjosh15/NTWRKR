Good points, and very cool reg. Moon gallery! Do you have a website I can
share? (PDFs don't share well on social...)

Things on this end are going well. We're growing a company, so nothing too
radical to share.

I may be in R.vik the morning of the 15th, if you're around! Heading back
to NYC to clean out the remainder of our old apartment, do some meetings,
etc...
