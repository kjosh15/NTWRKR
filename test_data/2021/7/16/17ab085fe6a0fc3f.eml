Sweets,

Olifur seemed game for my "Business English/Icelandic Dinner Club" idea. Do
you think this is a possibility for this fall if we did it once a month
(meeting at a restaurant)? I'd like to use it as an excuse to start meeting
people now but don't want to suggest it at the expense of supporting you as
you start school.

xoxo,
Josh
