All best,

If you&#39;re at all into video games, Phasmophobia is some of the best inn=
ovation I&#39;ve seen in a while and might be of interest to you. What make=
s Phasmo new and interesting is the careful incorporation of sound queues a=
nd you are required to talk to the game. This renders you susceptible to fe=
eling spooky and to jump scares. I feel that this qualifies as the sort of =
big-picture thinking you specialize in. Very often, sound is a secondary fe=
ature to a game but in Phasmophobia it&#39;s front and center. If you care =
to try it with some randos, my pals and I play most Wednesdays at 9:30 EST.=
