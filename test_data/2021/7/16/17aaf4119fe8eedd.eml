*TL;DR: Do we have any choices other than a) build a huge customer service
organization, or b) partner with a huge consultancy?*
The topic that's been most on my mind these days for Indigometrics is based
on the fact that we are seeing solid, steady growth with larger and larger
clients, an extremely sticky platform, and longer and larger deployments.
But. We're also seeing increasing demand from our clients to tell them what
to do with our results.

Because we measure *behavior* in great detail our insights are unusually
impactful, which means customers are prioritizing them. We are not a
business consultancy, however, and are still super small - only 5 people! -
and an ever larger percent of our time is being consumed in hand-holding
customers through figuring out business solutions.

This means that in order to grow we will either need to find a way to
satisfy these business needs through external partnership or build capacity
ourselves.

Doing the latter would (we imagine) mean hiring a COO, raising significant
funds (>$25mm), and ballooning the organization. This is a path seen in
many other B2C SaaS platforms.

It is not, however, a company I particularly want to run. It also misses
what I think is the real value of the organization, which is in our
analytics of scaled, unique corporate data. Being able to measure and
evaluate multiple solutions, behavior sets, and industries with highly
specific data means we will eventually be able to create predictive models
unlike anything else that exists, and potentially radically evolve large
organizations for much better, more agile outcomes.

The only alternative I can see is to partner with a large business services
firm. We've already gotten a very positive response from EY, KPMG,
Accenture, McKinsey, and soon (we hope) Bain. Conversations are ongoing,
but SOOOOO SLOOOOOOOOOW. And with each of them, we'll likely have to start
with internal piloting, then small-scale partnerships, and (hopefully)
eventually reselling.

So what am I missing? How can we quickly get around having to develop our
own internal business solutions team so that we can focus on growth and
analytics? We'd optimally like to be a whitelabeled solution to multiple
resellers so we can create a bidding war into an M&A event, but that'll
never happen if we're stuck struggling to complete basic tasks like
deployment architecture due to client overhead.

As ever, any thoughts/advice is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Josh

P.S. Note that we're not betting the farm on a home run with a consultancy;
while we're testing that hypothesis I'm also beginning outreach to large
L&D firms to see if there is reseller potential there to accelerate sales,
but this won't solve our core challenge - most L&D firms are (no offense)
one-trick ponies when it comes to their solution set.

P.P.S. Similarly, I think there's a more remote (but also more enticing)
option in becoming a recommended metricing solution for Social in ESG. I'm
meeting this week with Blackrock and also Blackstone in NYC to see if
either would be willing to conduct a joint project to evaluate our data for
exactly this. If it works, we may be able to solve our inbound sales
process with a more defensible "we will sell you the data, but don't ask us
what to do with it" position.
