I wrote a draft about my Personal Board that I want to put on my site so we
can reference diversity for Indigometrics. Can you tell me how this reads?

#######

One of the things that's really carried me through the pandemic is my
personal advisory board. Recently I've been getting a number of questions
about it so I thought I'd do a quick writeup on why I made it, why I think
it works (for me), and what I'd suggest others keep in mind in making their
own.


# why I made it

A while back I got really interested in getting a board position. This is
something that's really tricky to do without being a large corporate
executive first, but it is possible. I'd had the good luck to do some work
with the NACD (National Association of Corporate Directors) and was able to
take their XYZ course.

What I learned was that I knew a heck of a lot less than I'd thought I did
about running companies, and that I could learn a heck of a lot more from
folks with more (and more diverse) experience than my own.

As an entrepreneur and itinerant trying-of-new-things I knew that the best
way to learn is from the mistakes of your betters. I'd also been lucky
enough to meet and make friends with a wide group of people from diverse
backgrounds, many of them leaders in a variety of industries I had an
interest in.

Eventually I worked up the courage to write down a few guidelines and asked
a couple people I really respect if they'd try it. My rules were:

1. I send one email summary every other week,
2. My invitation email includes an overview of my complete professional
goals (short, medium, and long term) long with my strategy to achieve them,
3. Annually I remind everyone on my board that they're free to exit any
time, for any reason,
4. If I can ever do anything to help any of my board members, I will.

# why I think it works (for me)

There are two elements of my board that have really paid off for me.

1. Diversity

I got really lucky in making my Personal Advisory Board because I built it
with diversity in mind. I'm a straight white educated male; I'm already
hugely steeped in privilege, and I knew that my own bias was going to be
one of my biggest hurdles.

I also knew myself; I compulsively try new things, in areas I have no
experience or expertise in, and I often do a pretty good job of bluffing my
way into them. Surrounding myself with people who are similar reinforces
this tendency and leads to me and reality parting ways far to early in the
process. I needed diverse viewpoints to force me to look at my ideas
*better*

To that end, my current board has three men and three woman, two people of
color, and an age range from mid-thirties to late fifties. It's hardly
winning awards for providing all perspectives, but when I talk to peers
about who they turn to for trusted advice I'm a little shocked at how
atypical this is.

It needs to be reiterated that this isn't my brilliant foresight; in many
ways the fact that I was able to construct my board in the first place is
an artifact of my privilege. Optimizing for diversity was, honestly, dumb
luck and the encouragement of my partner. But looking back I'd never do it
any other way.

2. Articulation

This one is more straightforward. Choosing one question you're really
struggling with which could make a high-impact difference in your overall
career goal every other week - and writing it to a group of people you
admire and respect - forces you to think carefully about what the hell
you're doing.

If I'm out with my running club I can throw crappy ideas out all day just
to entertain myself with how clever I sound. But the people on my board
are, frankly, all smarter than I am to begin with and certainly equally as
busy.

Knowing that I am enjoying the benefit of their time every other week
forces me to think really hard about how much context I need to provide in
order to ask for help, be it as tactical as introductions or as ambiguous
as advice.

It also makes me think through all the plates I have in the air to choose
the one single thing that matters the most and which I know the least about
answering. That's gold.

# what I'd suggest others keep in mind in making their own.

Over the course of a year I've learned that there are a few things that
really matter in asking people for advice, especially when you do it twice
a month:

1. TL;DR: In every email include a one liner summing up your question
succinctly.

2. You get to ask one question. These people are doing you a favor; see
above for why one question matters.

3. Add value in what you ask. This one is a little trickier, but one of my
advisers summed it up by explaining that while he didn't respond often, he
ENJOYED reading my emails. "You are interesting, your work is interesting,
and you have interesting problems" he said. "I work in the financial
services sector solely with large multinationals, and you do all kinds of
crazy stuff in fields I know little about. Considering what I'd recommend
for the problems you face keeps me nimble and entertained."

This isn't true for everyone on my board, but I think it's a pretty good
theme. I'm not writing entertainment, but I am usually trying to do
something new. When I write my board emails I try to include key
hypothesis, any references I'm leaning on, and any insights I think are
pertinent to the problem at hand.

# Summary

If you can, I strongly suggest making your own personal advisory board.
Especially if you're an entrepreneur! Beyond the tactical business impact
my board has provided, the process of constructing biweekly updates has had
a huge affect on the success of my existing ventures. More importantly,
holding myself accountable to - and making myself available to learn from -
the group has given me deeply meaningful friendships, challenged me to grow
as a person, and forced me to truly live up to my values.

At the end of the day, there's not much more we can ask of the people we
can spend time with than that.
