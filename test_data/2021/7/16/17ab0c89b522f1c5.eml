To whom it may concern,

I'm looking for a regular tax firm who can manage my accounts as residing
in Iceland, with an LLC for consulting based in Wyoming and a startup that
is about to start paying a salary in the UK. I've also got vested stock in
a couple startups, one of which is about to exit. Does that sound like the
sort of thing you can handle/advise on?

Many thanks!!
Josh

P.S. FWIW, you were strongly recommended on NYU's ITP Alumni list!
