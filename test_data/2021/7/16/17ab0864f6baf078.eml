Steve,

Do you have any ideas on how to goose the group to provide video footage of
their efforts? I think we've managed to attract primarily introverts but
would love to see more activity and support better results.

One idea I had was to ask for private submissions of video for a "pandemic
compilation" if we get enough footage. Another was to just ask if anyone
needs help/support. What do you think?

All best wishes,
Josh
