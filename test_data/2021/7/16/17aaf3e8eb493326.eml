Ron,

Thanks again for the call the other day - as ever, you gave me a lot to
think about. One thing stood out, which is that I don't know what the
status is on the Shortlist sale, and haven't exercised my stock options
yet! I'm concerned about taxes and don't want to step on any toes if it
isn't public knowledge yet. Do you have any insight into timing?

Very much obliged,
Josh
