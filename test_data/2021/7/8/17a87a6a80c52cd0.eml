 I don't often have the chance to appear the nerd in my business of words (=
as you do in tech), but because I'm corresponding with someone who seems in=
terested in plumbing the linguistic depths, I'll mention that crossing one'=

ould be "fingers crossed," rather than "finger's crossed." Whenever you tir=
e of my commentary on such things, tell me, and I'll stop, or just throw so=
mething at the screen when we're on Zoom.=C2=A0 It was probably just a typo=
, but I'll take it anyway, just to feel superior in an arcane field for a m=

At the moment, my clients are the X2 already mentioned and Paradigm Corp, a=
 health care company that currently specializes in the gold standard of cat=

hat.=C2=A0 That is a new soccer club in LA that will begin playing next yea=

names behind Angel City.=C2=A0=C2=A0Mucho Barcelona has handled the marketi=

 I'll keep looking, but I think you're right - everyone knows this is a cri=

that question with our product first...
We're at least getting in the room - I have conversations coming up w/ KPMG=

 It's similar language across the board; the difference is that Bamboo seem=
