Thanks so much for the intro, Nate! Very much obliged. (To bcc.)

Rori, always pleased to talk with very smart people! I've got a ton of
questions and would love to get your take on what I think might be a
potential collaboration opportunity for Accenture. Do you have time for a
call in the next few weeks?

Thanks, all!
Josh
