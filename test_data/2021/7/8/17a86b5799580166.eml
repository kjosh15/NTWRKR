Glad you=E2=80=99re happy with it!  Any thoughts on the content or any =
specific lines or anything you think we=E2=80=99re missing from your =
perspective?

And YES, let=E2=80=99s absolutely get together while you=E2=80=99re in =
town and get these lines in person.  No need to record VO ahead of time, =
we=E2=80=99ll get it all at once so everything looks and sounds =
consistent. =20

The 19th is best on our end, as we have Allie and our gear available =
that day.  The rest of the week we have a couple other productions so =
Monday would be best if you can swing it.

We=E2=80=99re looking into a location now, but will likely be in BK.   I =
would carve out about 3 hours to be safe - what timing works for you =
that day?

Thanks!
