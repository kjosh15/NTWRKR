Mallika,

Thanks again for the reconnect today; it was good to catch up and I
appreciate your taking the time to listen to the pitch for Indigometrics!

I've attached our overview deck and there's a brief overview video here
<http://indigometrics.com>, but it sounds like the best next step is to
schedule a time to actually walk through the platform with Tom Cain. As
mentioned, I'll be in NYC starting next week through the 23rd; when would
be a good time after that?

All best wishes,
Josh
