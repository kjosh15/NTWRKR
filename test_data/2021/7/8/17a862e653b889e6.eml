Just following up as my calendar is starting to fill up; as of now I could
do:

16th morning and/or afternoon
18th morning and/or afternoon
19th morning

If it's possible to come in on the 16th that'd be best, as it'll mean that
if we need more time I'll still have another couple slots to come by. Let
me know if that works!

All best,
Josh
