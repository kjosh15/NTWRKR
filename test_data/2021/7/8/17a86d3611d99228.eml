19th it is; starting in the morning would be best, but I'll be coming from
Queens (staying with some friends), so maybe 9am-ish If we can start first
thing that'd be handy as I have an appointment with some folks at Blackrock
for lunch!

In terms of content let me have another watch through; overall I LOVE the
direction, the background content, the edit... My only critique (if I had
to make something up) would be in sharpening the focus and bringing out how
I can drive the show; being in person ought to help with that, but in terms
of content do you feel like it's hitting the right notes in terms of "How
human struggles create innovations that then (can) change the world"?

Super excited, and crazy glad I was able to nail a last-minute ticket. I
think having good audio ought to be a big plus if nothing else!
