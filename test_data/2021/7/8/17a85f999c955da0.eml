Rajiv,

Thanks so much for the call earlier; it was a pleasure to catch up. I'm
excited about the potential to work together!

To that end, I've attached our overview deck, and you can see a short
overview video here <http://www.indigometrics.com>. As mentioned, we're
negotiating with several large multinationals now and are happy to put you
forward as an option for when they're looking to solve for the problems we
identify.

Similarly, do let us know if you think we could help support the consulting
work you're doing. As mentioned, we prefer to license our platform as a
whitelabeled solution, so if we could do a JV that would let us both test
the relationship.

Finally, please do send any info you have on your education platform.
That's super interesting, and definitely the way of the future!!

All best wishes,
Josh
