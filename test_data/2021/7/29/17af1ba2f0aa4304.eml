I hope things are going well; managing parent health is tough!! My dad
managed to shoot off a finger, get prostate cancer, and mismanage a major
investment all in one 6-month period a few years back... good times.

I'll email the list and see what we get; there's a fair number of lurkers
there - it'd be good to get some content sharing from them!

Rodion's doing well. His Magpie didn't come back but he's got some other
birds going. His neural net software sounds interesting but I'm in no
position to evaluate how viable it is.

Onwards!

P.S. You ever do anything w/ RVs? We're living in one over the summer (and
old one!) and I've been noticing some big improvements in the newer ones.
