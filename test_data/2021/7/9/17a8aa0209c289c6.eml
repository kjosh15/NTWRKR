Next week I'm traveling; can you grab a time here
<http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest something that works after the 22nd
GMT?

FWIW, I ended up doing a cheap-and-cheerful version of the outreach
platform we discussed using a munged version of my contact list from Google
Contacts + Mailshake (a cold email drop feed platform) to multivariate test
outreach over the last year, and it works great! I consistently get 2-3
"serendipitous" calls per week with very high open/response rates. I'm
looking to do a revised version over 2022. I'd be curious to get your take
on it!

All best,
Josh
