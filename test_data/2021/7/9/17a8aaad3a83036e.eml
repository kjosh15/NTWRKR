Thanks for this, Richard! I'd read the semantics of fingers in this case as
structured around the crossing being owned by the fingers - so I guess I
should have written in fingers' crossed, which also doesn't look correct.
Thanks for the insight! Now if we could get people to stop using "loose" in
place of "lose" I suspect we'd both be happier people...

I'll keep my eyes open for electric motorcycle companies. Harley is the
only one I've heard from recently, aside from the ugly one out of New Lab
that you didn't care for.

I'm very curious about these letters you send. Do you have any drafts or
unused ones I could take a look at? I'm a big believer in the power of
language and would be curious to see how you structure them!

All best,
Josh
