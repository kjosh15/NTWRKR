Yes yes and oh hell yes!! Thanks for sending this; I really appreciate the
chance to understand better some of the concerns you may have about going
to school and embracing your own drive. Our kids need to see both of us
pursuing our dreams, and both of us supporting the other in pursuing them!

If you=E2=80=99re comfortable with it I=E2=80=99d love to talk about this f=
urther; your OT
program is an awesome opportunity for us as a family, in many ways because
of what it will demand of us. I couldn=E2=80=99t be happier about that!

Xoxo,
Josh
