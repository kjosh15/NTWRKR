One topic I keep coming back to, when thinking about America=E2=80=99s soci=
al unrest, is Twitter. Not =E2=80=9Csocial media=E2=80=9D, not Facebook, bu=
t Twitter specifically. I believe that this one platform is qualitatively d=
ifferent from others, and is a far more important cause of our age of disco=
rd than people generally realize. Here are some posts I=E2=80=99ve written =

=2E I pointed out that one of the heroes=
 was a Republican army vet, while the=
 other was a liberal hippie type. I lamented that our current national poli=
tical discourse so often sets decent guys like this against each other, and=
 wished that liberals and conservatives could put aside their mutual suspic=
ions and unite at the political level to defend the country against white s=
upremacism, fascism, and the general madness brought on by the age of Trump=
=2E This thread was very well-received,=20=
getting about 2000 retweets, 3300 lik=
es, and numerous mostly favorable quote-tweets.Nevertheless, there were som=
e who were dissatisfied with the thread. A few dozen people on the left wro=
te to complain that I was engaging in "both-sides-ism", i.e. putting too li=
ttle of the blame for the country's woes on the average Republican voter. S=
ome accused me of being an apologist for racism and fascism. A smaller numb=
er of responders were alt-right types wrote that the stabber had been a lef=
tist, not a rightist. Some of these responses reached 100 likes.Seeing this=
, a thought suddenly occurred to me: the ratio of people who expressed supp=
ort for the thread to those who expressed annoyance with it was over 20 to =
1. But if you scrolled down the thread, the ratio of=C2=A0words=C2=A0devote=
d to support vs. words devoted to annoyance would be more like 1 to 100. Or=
 pixels, or square centimeters of screen space, or whatever. In other words=
, the "annoyed" group, though far far smaller than the "supportive" group, =
grabbed a vastly larger amount of attention.And this in turn got me thinkin=
g: All of social media is like that. Not for the first time, I started to w=
orry that social media technology is hurting our popular discourse and our =
national politics. But for the first time, I could connect my worry to an i=
dentifiable and plausible phenomenon with well-known causes.I call it the S=
houting Class.Who are the Shouting Class?Everyone has problems with somethi=
ng in society. And everyone sometimes complains about those problems, which=

SadMeQuyq5lOG2xdRR_gECF4sG]. But for many people, voice is contingent - as =
soon as the problems are satisfactorily resolved they stop complaining and =
go back to living their daily lives. But a subset of people will never stop=
 complaining. When a problem becomes less severe, they switch to a differen=
t problem. And they will always find some problem that they feel requires t=
heir vocal complaint. That subset - the people who will never stop complain=
ing and giving negative feedback - are the Shouting Class. (Of course, this=
 isn't really a binary distinction; there are shades of gray, as always.)Th=
ere are several reasons people may be part of the Shouting Class:Reason 1: =
Idealism. Some people feel an emotional need to feel like they're improving=
 the world. Since the world is never perfect, and fighting for a better wor=
ld is intrinsic to these people's motivation (and probably their identity),=
 they will always continue to speak up. Notice that there are many, many id=
ealists who are not part of the Shouting Class - some express their idealis=
m by building homes for the poor, or volunteering at an animal shelter, or =
working as a civil rights lawyer, or being a politician. Shouting Class ide=
alists are only those idealists who see shouting as a key way to bring abou=
t positive change.Reason 2: Personal Unhappiness.=C2=A0Research shows [http=

nline trolling. We also have good reason to believe that some people are ju=
st generally unhappy people - though life events make them relatively happi=
er or sadder, their baseline is a negative emotional state that changes onl=
y very slowly. In other words, some people join the Shouting Class because =
they are giving vent to the negative emotion that they are constantly exper=
iencing for reasons mostly unrelated to the problems they're complaining ab=
out.Reason 3: Sadism.=C2=A0Research shows [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c=

motivations for Shouting have applied to me at one time or another. I'm a f=
airly idealistic person. Like everyone, I was pretty unhappy in grad school=

al consequences.Twitter is obviously much more extreme than Facebook in the=
se regards. It's a lot easier to be pseudonymous. Posts can get shared much=
 more quickly. And you can talk to anyone you like, unless they block you. =
More importantly, you can talk to=C2=A0the followers=C2=A0of anyone you lik=
e - if I'm the first to reply to a Donald Trump tweet, most of the people w=
ho click on that tweet will see my reply as well. That's massive exposure.S=
o Twitter, especially, gives instant safe mass exposure to anyone who wants=
 to complain about anything. In practice, this gives an enormous bullhorn t=
o the Shouting Class, because they are defined as=C2=A0the people who want =
to use the bullhorn.Consider life before social media. If you wanted to com=
plain about something, you could do it in person, but you'd suffer reputati=
onal and other risks. You could write a letter to the editor, but it was su=
bject to editorial filtering, and you could only get letters published occa=
sionally. Same with calling in to radio shows. You could start your own med=
ia outlet and pass it around, but dominance of large newspapers, radio show=
s, and TV stations limited the circulation you could achieve. Even in the e=
arly age of the internet, shouting was a lot harder than it is now. You cou=
ld make a website, but because of the lack of social sharing, it would be r=
elatively hard to gain a large audience. Forums were highly fragmented and =
also lacked the sharing option.In other words, shouting just wasn't nearly =
as easy in 1987 or even 2007 as it is in 2017. Social media, especially Twi=

When NPR analyzed the number of people who left at least one comment in bot=
h June and July, the numbers showed an even more interesting pattern: Just =
4,300 users posted about 145 comments apiece, or 67 percent of all NPR.org =
comments for the two months. More than half of all comments in May, June an=
d July combined came from a mere 2,600 users. The conclusion: NPR's comment=

was something like 20 to 1. That's not as lopsided as the ratios for NPR co=

 benefits of the Shouting ClassIt would be unfair to paint the Shouting Cla=
ss as a purely negative phenomenon. Many of the Shouters are not Twitter Na=
zis or compulsive mansplainers or pissed-off PhD students. Many are simply =
idealists who are sincerely trying to change the world for the better.And s=
ometimes that works. "Voice", to use Hirschman's terminology, is sometimes =
effective. For example, the=C2=A0marriage equality movement [https://email.=

iage. That movement didn't rely very much on direct action, threats of viol=
ence, civil disobedience, foreign political pressure, etc. Instead, it was =
basically just a bunch of people speaking up. And in my opinion, they chang=
ed the world for the better in a significant way.Now, it's important to rea=
lize that most of the people in the marriage equality movement were not, th=
emselves, part of the Shouting Class. They were speaking up because of a sp=
ecific problem, and once that problem was solved, their use of "voice" dimi=
nished. In other words, they could be satisfied.But the members of the Shou=
ting Class who joined that movement brought a lot of important resources to=
 the table. They brought experience (which of course they had plenty of), e=
nergy, solidarity, time and money. Without them, it might have been much ha=
rder to win the marriage equality fight.I'm sure if you look throughout his=
tory you'll see plenty of movements like this, where the Shouting Class ser=
ved as the vanguard and the shock troops for a larger group of temporary ac=
tivists. Without the idealistic Shouters always looking for new problems to=
 be upset about, social progress might grind to a halt, and deep injustices=
 or inefficiencies remain undiscovered for decades or even centuries.Or it =
might not. Of course it's hard to know, since there's always a Shouting Cla=
ss, so we don't really know what the world would be like without them. Afte=
r social media has been around for a while, it'll be possible for political=
 scientists to find natural experiments to tell whether its amplifying effe=
ct sped up social progress or not. But until then, I'd say we have to at le=
ast acknowledge the distinct=C2=A0possibility=C2=A0that a subset of the Sho=
uting Class often does good for the world.The Shouting Class and excess neg=
ativityBut now I'd like to talk about some of the costs of the Shouting Cla=
ss and the bullhorn social media has given them. The most obvious cost is j=
ust negativity. People like it when other people agree with them and say ni=
ce things to them, and they dislike it when people disagree with them and s=
ay mean things to them. That's so obvious that I'm not even going to bother=
 looking up research to confirm it!So now consider how the Shouting Class c=
reates an asymmetry here. Suppose I say something on social media that 100 =
people agree with and 50 people disagree with. If everyone gave me explicit=
 feedback, I'd get 100 zaps of positive emotion and 50 zaps of negative emo=
tion. And assuming (for the sake of simplicity) that those zaps are of the =
same intensity, I'll come away feeling happy on balance.But the 100 agree-e=
rs are much less likely to be part of the Shouting Class than the 50 disagr=
ee-ers, because the Shouting Class goes around disagreeing with stuff. So t=
he agree-ers will simply click the "like" or "favorite" button, while the d=
isagree-ers will write an explicit response to explain why they disagree. T=
he way social media is set up means that the number of likes or favorites i=
s just a number, which I can click on to show a face or profile. But all th=
e disagreeing responses will be full, written-out things. The negative emot=
ional zap I get from each of those certainly outweighs the positive zap I g=
et from my favorite count going one higher.So I end up walking away feeling=
 bad, because I got 50 very powerful negative zaps from the Shouting Class,=
 and 100 very weak zaps from the majority who agreed with me.Oh, but it get=
s much much worse. Instead of thinking of just my one post, let's think abo=
ut 1000 people, each with their own post. It's here that we see the massive=
 emotional destructive power of the Shouting Class.The Shouting Class is al=
ways going around looking for something to shout at. This could mean they'r=
e likely to either follow more accounts, or read more posts, or both. If th=
at's the case, then their negative emotional impact is multiplied even furt=
her. Imagine each of the 1000 people writes one post, each of which gets a =
like or favorite from 100 people, each of whom only reads=C2=A0that one pos=
t. But imagine there are 50 Shouters who go around reading all 1000 posts, =
and leaving a disparaging comment with each one.In this extreme example, th=
e positive emotional feedback of 100,000 positive people is vastly outweigh=
ed by the negative emotional feedback of just 50 people!Now, that's an extr=
eme example. But it shows how the greater energy, zeal, and time commitment=
 of the Shouting Class, combined with the bullhorn of social media, tips th=
e balance of social media's emotional effect dramatically toward the negati=
ve.Much research has been done on the=C2=A0negative impact of Facebook [htt=

fered have involved excessive forced social comparison and isolation from r=
eal-world interaction. But I believe the impact of excessively negative dis=
cussions could also be a reason for the effect, and I suspect that it's muc=
h worse for Twitter.The Shouting Class and excessive social censureIf your =
social group is small - a handful of friends, a social club, etc. - there's=
 a good chance that everyone in it will like you. And there's a good chance=
 that if you only mildly annoy someone, the chance that they will complain =
openly to the group is low, because of the costs involved. They might take =
you aside and say something privately, or say nothing, but they'll only tak=
e it to the whole group if you've very egregiously offended the.But as your=
 social group increases in size, the number of people who might be annoyed,=
 offended, or upset by any given thing you do goes up. With a group of 5, t=
here's a high probability that any given thing you do or say will be inoffe=
nsive to all involved. With a group of 500, the probability of you being of=
fensive to someone is far=C2=A0larger, since A) 500 is a lot more than 5, a=
nd B) the 500 is going to be a less carefully selected set than the 5.In pa=
rticular, with 500 people rather than 5, your social group is much larger t=
o include at least one member of the Shouting Class, who by his or her natu=
re goes around looking for things to complain about, argue with, or be offe=
nded by.Social media expands social groups enormously. That has, pretty pre=
dictably, resulted in the development of what young people refer to as "cal=

 "called out" by a member of the Shouting Class. Some excerpts from his art=
icle:
Today, so many people are declaring so many things problematic on college c=
ampuses that the next controversy is almost impossible to predict; it is in=
creasingly common to have done something without any fear of giving offense=
 (say, urging a sushi night in the dining hall) only to subsequently read t=
hat the thing you=E2=80=99re on record having done is the object of a huge =
controversy elsewhere. Does the faraway story portend a future where you=E2=
=80=99ll be the one in the hot seat?=C2=A0
No wonder so many students are stressed out by this. And the risk-averse ha=
ve it especially hard. =E2=80=9CI probably hold back 90 percent of the thin=
gs that I want to say due to fear of being called out,=E2=80=9D another stu=
dent wrote. =E2=80=9CPeople won=E2=80=99t call you out because your opinion=
 is wrong. People will call you out for literally anything. On Twitter toda=
y I came across someone making fun a girl who made a video talking about ho=
w much she loved God and how she was praying for everyone. There were hundr=
eds of comments, rude comments, below the video. It was to the point that t=
hey weren=E2=80=99t even making fun of what she was standing for. They were=
 picking apart everything. Her eyebrows, the way her mouth moves, her voice=
, the way her hair was parted. Ridiculous. I am not the kind of person to b=
e able to brush off insults like that. Hence why I avoid any situation that=
 could put me in that position. And that=E2=80=99s sad.=E2=80=9D
This seems like much more of a Facebook problem than a Twitter one, given t=
hat Facebook represents offline social ties far more. It's never happened t=
o me, but I went to college before the Facebook age (yes, I'm that old). Bu=
t I know a lot of people seven or ten or fifteen years younger than me who =
all loudly bemoan "callout culture" in very similar terms to what Friedersd=
orf's article describes. Even though some of them engage in it themselves.I=
 should note that something like this=C2=A0can=C2=A0happen on Twitter too. =
On Twitter, people tend to form groups not by real-life friendships, but by=
 political affiliation. I'm a generally left-leaning kind of guy, so my fol=
lowers tend to be left-leaning folks as well. So when I write something tha=
t seems vaguely nice, conciliatory, or even non-condemnatory about any Repu=
blicans, it's highly likely I'll be "called out" by left-leaning people els=
ewhere in the Twitterverse. On Twitter, as in the Facebook-real life nexus,=
 many people respond to this ever-present threat by staying silent; others,=
 by trying to hunt down and shame anyone who calls them out. Fortunately fo=
r me, I don't much mind, but I think most people mind more than I do.Anyway=
, for centuries, humans have tended to have small, strongly tied inner soci=
al circles and larger, more weakly tied outer circles. We tend to respond s=
trongly to any vocal criticism within the inner circle. But social media ha=
s thrown this concentric pattern of social circles into disarray, by making=
 the inner circle just as "strong" as the outer one in some ways. So critic=
ism from someone in the outer circle now often carries the social weight an=
d destructive power that only the inner circle should really have. The Shou=
ting Class have thus gained inordinate power over who gets liked and who ge=
ts ostracized, and much of the result seems negative so far. I'd like to se=
e a lot more formal research on this, however, before we draw firm conclusi=

After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the=
 likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person=
's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual events, s=
uch as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, le=
ss sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For exampl=
e, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, peop=
le tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely because they can more re=
adily recall an example from memory. Moreover, unusual and vivid events lik=
e homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass me=
dia than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases.
Now apply this heuristic to social media and the Shouting Class. If you see=
 a bunch of people arguing and shouting about stuff, and you=C2=A0don't=C2=

u're probably going to think that society is a lot more discordant and divi=

at each other. In fact, because the Shouting Class' appetite for shouting i=
s infinite, they will shout at each other infinitely if they encounter each=
 other.Before social media, it was difficult for members of the Shouting Cl=
ass to find each other. I remember walking by a protest in October of 2001 =
and seeing pro-war and anti-war protesters shouting in each other's faces. =
I was stunned at the intensity of the discord. Today, I wouldn't even bat a=
n eye. Social media, especially Twitter, immediately puts shouters from all=
 over the world in contact with each other. The shouting is continuous.This=
 fuels the perception that society is irrevocably and deeply divided. Ameri=

ternal battles of the Shouting Class on both platforms. More than one write=

 a grain of truth to that description.The problem is not just that the Shou=

laining and fighting, they get the urge to join. If society is irrevocably =
divided, even people who aren't members of the Shouting Class feel the need=
 to fight for their side, or risk being overwhelmed by the enemy.But 2016 w=
on't be the last Twitter Election. Remember, because the Shouting Class' ap=
petite for shouting is insatiable, nothing that happens at the wider politi=
cal level will make them stop shouting. So there will always be a baseline =
level of discord and anger visible to everyone on social media, and there w=
ill always be the danger of that discord spreading like a contagious diseas=
e.The Shouting Class and the exhaustion of sympathyImagine that you are wal=
king through a city and a hungry homeless person comes up to you and asks f=
or money to buy food. You might give him money and walk away feeling good, =
imagining how now he won't go hungry. But now imagine that you walk past a =
row of 100 hungry homeless people, and you don't have nearly enough money t=
o give all of them. Even if you now feed 5 hungry people instead of just 1,=
 you'll probably walk away feeling bad, knowing that there are more hungry =
people out there than you can help.That's not a perfect analogy for the way=
 the Shouting Class overloads our empathy. Hunger and homelessness could be=
 completely solved if we had the social will to pony up the money. But the =
anguish of the Shouting Class is a hole that will never be filled.Most of t=
he Shouting Class, with the exception of those who are just there to manspl=
ain, blow off steam, or have a good argument, express deep dissatisfaction =
with society. But unlike those who join movements temporarily in order to g=
et concrete results, the Shouting Class' disaffection is not something that=
 can be fixed.Idealistic Shouters will continue to find something to crusad=
e for, but their ideals will differ, so they can't all be appeased at once.=
 Moving in the direction of a liberal idealist's vision will not diminish h=
is hunger for further social change, even as it drives conservative idealis=
ts to rage and despair.Unhappy Shouters will continue to have problems with=
 society because they are displacing negative emotion that really doesn't c=
ome from society at all. An angry, unhappy person can't be made happy by li=
ving in even the most utopian of feasible societies. What they need is not =
utopia but a hug, and possibly some therapy.Sadistic Shouters don't actuall=
y want social change, but merely to give people a hard time, troll them, or=
 "trigger" them. Sometimes they do this by pretending they have deep proble=
ms with society.So no matter how much we change society, or in what directi=
on, there will be a baseline level of publicly expressed social disaffectio=
n that we can't get below. With social media giving the Shouting Class a bu=
llhorn, that baseline level is far higher thanFor those of us who feel symp=
athy for victims of social injustice, this can be maddening. Most of us are=
 basically good folks - when we see someone who appears to be victimized by=
 society, we want to help them. We want to improve society, to make it bett=

R].So when nothing we accomplish can diminish the seeming anguish of the Sh=
outers, what are we to do? We can exert ourselves ever more mightily to cha=
nge society, but when we look at the past, and see that all our past succes=
ses have failed to diminish the shouting, we are liable to fall into despai=
r and a feeling of powerlessness.Which brings me to the final potential pro=
blem with the Shouting Class...What if it forces us to become callous?The c=
ost of immunity to the Shouting ClassUltimately, all of these problems - ne=
gativity, social censure, social discord, and empathy exhaustion - can be d=
ealt with by developing an immunity to shouting. In other words, by becomin=
g callous toward people's expression of approbation, dissatisfaction, angui=
sh, irritation, etc. In fact, people on social media say this all the time:=
 "Grow a thicker skin!"But what are the costs of having a thick-skinned soc=
iety? One potential cost is that elites and social institutions become unre=
sponsive to legitimate calls for social change.I saw this in action in coll=
ege, with the protest community. At one point I joined some protests demand=
ing higher wages for Stanford custodial workers. We marched, we yelled outs=
ide the president's office til he came out and talked to us. They raised th=
e workers' wages.But after that victory, I was astonished to see the protes=
t leaders sit down and immediately start planning their next campaign. I as=
ked them why they didn't intend to reward the establishment for giving grou=
nd on the wage issue. They just sort of gave me disparaging looks, except f=
or one guy who told me "Frankly, I go to protests to hook up with hot anarc=
hist chicks."The Shouting Class is mostly not looking to hook up. But like =
those protesters, social media's Shouting Class has adopted criticism, ange=
r, and disaffection as ways of life - not the means to an end, but the end =
in and of itself. Eventually, just as Stanford's administrators mostly stop=
ped paying heed to the protest community, the powers that be will learn to =
accept and ignore a very high baseline level of popular disaffection. And t=
hat will raise the bar for movements whose needs are more urgent and realis=
tic and capable of being satisfied - it'll be hard to tell real grievance f=
rom grievance-as-a-lifestyle.(I sort of think suspect something like this h=
appened with the Tea Party and Obama. The theory is that when Democrats saw=
 that nothing could possibly appease the Republicans, they stopped paying a=
ttention to them at all, which I think drove GOP voters to amp up the extre=
mism to levels previously unheard of, in the form of Trump.)I worry that th=
e costs of evolved callousness could go way beyond political protest moveme=
nts, though. When people shout "We are in pain! [https://email.mg2.substack=

 Jefferson, they mean much more than simply having the government get its h=

ot quite what we get. When Big Media's power was shattered, that power pass=

no return to Edward R. Murrow, and the big newspapers will probably continu=

ied defending Muslim women on a train. I pointed out that one of the heroes=
 was a Republican army vet, while the other was a liberal hippie type. I la=
mented that our current national political discourse so often sets decent g=
uys like this against each other, and wished that liberals and conservative=
s could put aside their mutual suspicions and unite at the political level =
to defend the country against white supremacism, fascism, and the general m=
adness brought on by the age of Trump. This thread was very well-received, =
getting about 2000 retweets, 3300 likes, and numerous mostly favorable quot=
e-tweets.<br><br>Nevertheless, there were some who were dissatisfied with t=
he thread. A few dozen people on the left wrote to complain that I was enga=
ging in "both-sides-ism", i.e. putting too little of the blame for the coun=
try's woes on the average Republican voter. Some accused me of being an apo=
logist for racism and fascism. A smaller number of responders were alt-righ=
t types wrote that the stabber had been a leftist, not a rightist. Some of =
these responses reached 100 likes.<br><br>Seeing this, a thought suddenly o=
ccurred to me: the ratio of people who expressed support for the thread to =
those who expressed annoyance with it was over 20 to 1. But if you scrolled=
 down the thread, the ratio of&nbsp;<em>words</em>&nbsp;devoted to support =
vs. words devoted to annoyance would be more like 1 to 100. Or pixels, or s=
quare centimeters of screen space, or whatever. In other words, the "annoye=
d" group, though far far smaller than the "supportive" group, grabbed a vas=
tly larger amount of attention.<br><br>And this in turn got me thinking: Al=
l of social media is like that. Not for the first time, I started to worry =
that social media technology is hurting our popular discourse and our natio=
nal politics. But for the first time, I could connect my worry to an identi=
fiable and plausible phenomenon with well-known causes.<br><br>I call it th=

e, voice is contingent - as soon as the problems are satisfactorily resolve=
d they stop complaining and go back to living their daily lives. But a subs=
et of people will never stop complaining. When a problem becomes less sever=
e, they switch to a different problem. And they will always find some probl=
em that they feel requires their vocal complaint. That subset - the people =
who will never stop complaining and giving negative feedback - are the Shou=
ting Class. (Of course, this isn't really a binary distinction; there are s=
hades of gray, as always.)<br><br>There are several reasons people may be p=
art of the Shouting Class:<br><br>Reason 1: Idealism. Some people feel an e=
motional need to feel like they're improving the world. Since the world is =
never perfect, and fighting for a better world is intrinsic to these people=
's motivation (and probably their identity), they will always continue to s=
peak up. Notice that there are many, many idealists who are not part of the=
 Shouting Class - some express their idealism by building homes for the poo=
r, or volunteering at an animal shelter, or working as a civil rights lawye=
r, or being a politician. Shouting Class idealists are only those idealists=
 who see shouting as a key way to bring about positive change.<br><br>Reaso=

otivations for Shouting have applied to me at one time or another. I'm a fa=
irly idealistic person. Like everyone, I was pretty unhappy in grad school,=
 which I think had a lot to do with why I started blogging and tweeting. As=
 a teenager, I delighted in flustering people in anonymous internet forums.=
 And many people tell me that I am an argumentative guy. :-)<br><br>Althoug=
h I feel a lot less of a desire to complain, criticize, and confront people=
 online than I used to - I am not as much of a Shouter as before - I doubt =
this desire will ever completely go away. But when I look at my friends and=
 family, very few are like me in this regard. They occasionally vent about =
their problems to people they know, but going on social media and giving pe=
ople a hard time about things just isn't something they do.<br><br><br><str=

/a>, there are no reputational consequences.<br><br>Twitter is obviously mu=
ch more extreme than Facebook in these regards. It's a lot easier to be pse=
udonymous. Posts can get shared much more quickly. And you can talk to anyo=
ne you like, unless they block you. More importantly, you can talk to&nbsp;=
<em>the followers</em>&nbsp;of anyone you like - if I'm the first to reply =
to a Donald Trump tweet, most of the people who click on that tweet will se=
e my reply as well. That's massive exposure.<br><br>So Twitter, especially,=
 gives instant safe mass exposure to anyone who wants to complain about any=
thing. In practice, this gives an enormous bullhorn to the Shouting Class, =
because they are defined as&nbsp;<em>the people who want to use the bullhor=
n</em>.<br><br>Consider life before social media. If you wanted to complain=
 about something, you could do it in person, but you'd suffer reputational =
and other risks. You could write a letter to the editor, but it was subject=
 to editorial filtering, and you could only get letters published occasiona=
lly. Same with calling in to radio shows. You could start your own media ou=
tlet and pass it around, but dominance of large newspapers, radio shows, an=
d TV stations limited the circulation you could achieve. Even in the early =
age of the internet, shouting was a lot harder than it is now. You could ma=
ke a website, but because of the lack of social sharing, it would be relati=
vely hard to gain a large audience. Forums were highly fragmented and also =
lacked the sharing option.<br><br>In other words, shouting just wasn't near=
ly as easy in 1987 or even 2007 as it is in 2017. Social media, especially =
Twitter, has changed the game entirely.<br><br><br><strong>The Shouting Cla=
ss looks larger than it really is</strong><br><br>It's important to realize=
 that the Shouting Class isn't really that large. Most of the people out th=
ere in the world are&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>the kind of people you see comm=

ple's minds about gay marriage. That movement didn't rely very much on dire=
ct action, threats of violence, civil disobedience, foreign political press=
ure, etc. Instead, it was basically just a bunch of people speaking up. And=
 in my opinion, they changed the world for the better in a significant way.=
<br><br>Now, it's important to realize that most of the people in the marri=
age equality movement were not, themselves, part of the Shouting Class. The=
y were speaking up because of a specific problem, and once that problem was=
 solved, their use of "voice" diminished. In other words, they could be sat=
isfied.<br><br>But the members of the Shouting Class who joined that moveme=
nt brought a lot of important resources to the table. They brought experien=
ce (which of course they had plenty of), energy, solidarity, time and money=
=2E Without them, it might have been muc=
h harder to win the marriage equality=
 fight.<br><br>I'm sure if you look throughout history you'll see plenty of=
 movements like this, where the Shouting Class served as the vanguard and t=
he shock troops for a larger group of temporary activists. Without the idea=
listic Shouters always looking for new problems to be upset about, social p=
rogress might grind to a halt, and deep injustices or inefficiencies remain=
 undiscovered for decades or even centuries.<br><br>Or it might not. Of cou=
rse it's hard to know, since there's always a Shouting Class, so we don't r=
eally know what the world would be like without them. After social media ha=
s been around for a while, it'll be possible for political scientists to fi=
nd natural experiments to tell whether its amplifying effect sped up social=
 progress or not. But until then, I'd say we have to at least acknowledge t=
he distinct&nbsp;<em>possibility</em>&nbsp;that a subset of the Shouting Cl=
ass often does good for the world.<br><br><br><strong>The Shouting Class an=
d excess negativity</strong><br><br>But now I'd like to talk about some of =
the costs of the Shouting Class and the bullhorn social media has given the=
m. The most obvious cost is just negativity. People like it when other peop=
le agree with them and say nice things to them, and they dislike it when pe=
ople disagree with them and say mean things to them. That's so obvious that=
 I'm not even going to bother looking up research to confirm it!<br><br>So =
now consider how the Shouting Class creates an asymmetry here. Suppose I sa=
y something on social media that 100 people agree with and 50 people disagr=
ee with. If everyone gave me explicit feedback, I'd get 100 zaps of positiv=
e emotion and 50 zaps of negative emotion. And assuming (for the sake of si=
mplicity) that those zaps are of the same intensity, I'll come away feeling=
 happy on balance.<br><br>But the 100 agree-ers are much less likely to be =
part of the Shouting Class than the 50 disagree-ers, because the Shouting C=
lass goes around disagreeing with stuff. So the agree-ers will simply click=
 the "like" or "favorite" button, while the disagree-ers will write an expl=
icit response to explain why they disagree. The way social media is set up =
means that the number of likes or favorites is just a number, which I can c=
lick on to show a face or profile. But all the disagreeing responses will b=
e full, written-out things. The negative emotional zap I get from each of t=
hose certainly outweighs the positive zap I get from my favorite count goin=
g one higher.<br><br>So I end up walking away feeling bad, because I got 50=
 very powerful negative zaps from the Shouting Class, and 100 very weak zap=
s from the majority who agreed with me.<br><br>Oh, but it gets much much wo=
rse. Instead of thinking of just my one post, let's think about 1000 people=
, each with their own post. It's here that we see the massive emotional des=
tructive power of the Shouting Class.<br><br>The Shouting Class is always g=
oing around looking for something to shout at. This could mean they're like=
ly to either follow more accounts, or read more posts, or both. If that's t=
he case, then their negative emotional impact is multiplied even further. I=
magine each of the 1000 people writes one post, each of which gets a like o=
r favorite from 100 people, each of whom only reads&nbsp;<em>that one post<=
/em>. But imagine there are 50 Shouters who go around reading all 1000 post=
s, and leaving a disparaging comment with each one.<br><br>In this extreme =
example, the positive emotional feedback of 100,000 positive people is vast=
ly outweighed by the negative emotional feedback of just 50 people!<br><br>=
Now, that's an extreme example. But it shows how the greater energy, zeal, =
and time commitment of the Shouting Class, combined with the bullhorn of so=
cial media, tips the balance of social media's emotional effect dramaticall=
y toward the negative.<br><br>Much research has been done on the&nbsp;<a hr=

roblematic on college campuses that the next controversy is almost impossib=

 fear of giving offense (say, urging a sushi night in the dining hall) only=
 to subsequently read that the thing you&#8217;re on record having done is =
the object of a huge controversy elsewhere. Does the faraway story portend =
a future where you&#8217;ll be the one in the hot seat?&nbsp;</p><p style=

our opinion is wrong. People will call you out for literally anything. On T=

 were hundreds of comments, rude comments, below the video. It was to the p=

They were picking apart everything. Her eyebrows, the way her mouth moves, =
her voice, the way her hair was parted. Ridiculous. I am not the kind of pe=

blockquote><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; =
margin: 0 0 1em 0;">This seems like much more of a Facebook problem than a =
Twitter one, given that Facebook represents offline social ties far more. I=
t's never happened to me, but I went to college before the Facebook age (ye=
s, I'm that old). But I know a lot of people seven or ten or fifteen years =
younger than me who all loudly bemoan "callout culture" in very similar ter=
ms to what Friedersdorf's article describes. Even though some of them engag=
e in it themselves.<br><br>I should note that something like this&nbsp;<em>=
can</em>&nbsp;happen on Twitter too. On Twitter, people tend to form groups=
 not by real-life friendships, but by political affiliation. I'm a generall=
y left-leaning kind of guy, so my followers tend to be left-leaning folks a=
s well. So when I write something that seems vaguely nice, conciliatory, or=
 even non-condemnatory about any Republicans, it's highly likely I'll be "c=
alled out" by left-leaning people elsewhere in the Twitterverse. On Twitter=
, as in the Facebook-real life nexus, many people respond to this ever-pres=
ent threat by staying silent; others, by trying to hunt down and shame anyo=
ne who calls them out. Fortunately for me, I don't much mind, but I think m=
ost people mind more than I do.<br><br>Anyway, for centuries, humans have t=
ended to have small, strongly tied inner social circles and larger, more we=
akly tied outer circles. We tend to respond strongly to any vocal criticism=
 within the inner circle. But social media has thrown this concentric patte=
rn of social circles into disarray, by making the inner circle just as "str=
ong" as the outer one in some ways. So criticism from someone in the outer =
circle now often carries the social weight and destructive power that only =
the inner circle should really have. The Shouting Class have thus gained in=
ordinate power over who gets liked and who gets ostracized, and much of the=
 result seems negative so far. I'd like to see a lot more formal research o=
n this, however, before we draw firm conclusions.<br><br><br><strong>The Sh=

 has not dissipated during Trump's presidency, and it would not have dissip=

helmed by the enemy.<br><br>But 2016 won't be the last Twitter Election. Re=
member, because the Shouting Class' appetite for shouting is insatiable, no=
thing that happens at the wider political level will make them stop shoutin=
g. So there will always be a baseline level of discord and anger visible to=
 everyone on social media, and there will always be the danger of that disc=
ord spreading like a contagious disease.<br><br><br><strong>The Shouting Cl=
ass and the exhaustion of sympathy</strong><br><br>Imagine that you are wal=
king through a city and a hungry homeless person comes up to you and asks f=
or money to buy food. You might give him money and walk away feeling good, =
imagining how now he won't go hungry. But now imagine that you walk past a =
row of 100 hungry homeless people, and you don't have nearly enough money t=
o give all of them. Even if you now feed 5 hungry people instead of just 1,=
 you'll probably walk away feeling bad, knowing that there are more hungry =
people out there than you can help.<br><br>That's not a perfect analogy for=
 the way the Shouting Class overloads our empathy. Hunger and homelessness =
could be completely solved if we had the social will to pony up the money. =
But the anguish of the Shouting Class is a hole that will never be filled.<=
br><br>Most of the Shouting Class, with the exception of those who are just=
 there to mansplain, blow off steam, or have a good argument, express deep =
dissatisfaction with society. But unlike those who join movements temporari=
ly in order to get concrete results, the Shouting Class' disaffection is no=
t something that can be fixed.<br><br>Idealistic Shouters will continue to =
find something to crusade for, but their ideals will differ, so they can't =
all be appeased at once. Moving in the direction of a liberal idealist's vi=
sion will not diminish his hunger for further social change, even as it dri=
ves conservative idealists to rage and despair.<br><br>Unhappy Shouters wil=
l continue to have problems with society because they are displacing negati=
ve emotion that really doesn't come from society at all. An angry, unhappy =
person can't be made happy by living in even the most utopian of feasible s=
ocieties. What they need is not utopia but a hug, and possibly some therapy=
=2E<br><br>Sadistic Shouters don't actua=

 give people a hard time, troll them, or "trigger" them. Sometimes they do =
this by pretending they have deep problems with society.<br><br>So no matte=

do? We can exert ourselves ever more mightily to change society, but when w=

nish the shouting, we are liable to fall into despair and a feeling of powe=

houting Class...What if it forces us to become callous?<br><br><br><strong>=
The cost of immunity to the Shouting Class</strong><br><br>Ultimately, all =
of these problems - negativity, social censure, social discord, and empathy=
 exhaustion - can be dealt with by developing an immunity to shouting. In o=
ther words, by becoming callous toward people's expression of approbation, =
dissatisfaction, anguish, irritation, etc. In fact, people on social media =
say this all the time: "Grow a thicker skin!"<br><br>But what are the costs=
 of having a thick-skinned society? One potential cost is that elites and s=
ocial institutions become unresponsive to legitimate calls for social chang=
e.<br><br>I saw this in action in college, with the protest community. At o=
ne point I joined some protests demanding higher wages for Stanford custodi=
al workers. We marched, we yelled outside the president's office til he cam=
e out and talked to us. They raised the workers' wages.<br><br>But after th=
at victory, I was astonished to see the protest leaders sit down and immedi=
ately start planning their next campaign. I asked them why they didn't inte=
nd to reward the establishment for giving ground on the wage issue. They ju=
st sort of gave me disparaging looks, except for one guy who told me "Frank=
ly, I go to protests to hook up with hot anarchist chicks."<br><br>The Shou=
ting Class is mostly not looking to hook up. But like those protesters, soc=
ial media's Shouting Class has adopted criticism, anger, and disaffection a=
s ways of life - not the means to an end, but the end in and of itself. Eve=
ntually, just as Stanford's administrators mostly stopped paying heed to th=
e protest community, the powers that be will learn to accept and ignore a v=
ery high baseline level of popular disaffection. And that will raise the ba=
r for movements whose needs are more urgent and realistic and capable of be=
ing satisfied - it'll be hard to tell real grievance from grievance-as-a-li=
festyle.<br><br>(I sort of think suspect something like this happened with =
the Tea Party and Obama. The theory is that when Democrats saw that nothing=
 could possibly appease the Republicans, they stopped paying attention to t=
hem at all, which I think drove GOP voters to amp up the extremism to level=
s previously unheard of, in the form of Trump.)<br><br>I worry that the cos=
ts of evolved callousness could go way beyond political protest movements, =
though. When people shout "<a href=3D"https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwl=
