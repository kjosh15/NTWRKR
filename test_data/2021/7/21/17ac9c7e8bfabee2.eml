Good Morning Team,

Just wanted to say THANK YOU again for a wonderful evening. That was long
overdue and it was great to finally meet the full team in person! Truly
believe we have created something very special together - which is just a
testament to all of you. Accenture & UM, I know we keep saying it...but
it's true...it has been so refreshing being able to work with such
collaborative and *understanding* partners. Looking forward to all of the
great work ahead and happy to be on this journey with all of you!

@Josh Klein <josh@josh.is>  , thank you for being a part of this project  -
I felt like I was meeting a celebrity last night after hearing your voice
for so many hours now!

@Appel, Marc <m.appel@accenture.com> (and any other Burger lovers) - these
are def in top 5 burgers in Manhattan Raoul's Review
<https://ny.eater.com/2015/8/31/9204733/raouls-burger-review> (they are
making more during the pandemic and it's easier to get. They also serve it
brunch). Virginia's Review
<https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/virginias>. The Bar
Sardine burger is now at Fairfax <https://www.fairfax.nyc/menus/>. But
there's so many more, like we said it really depends on what you are in the
mood for...but these never disappoint! Couple others to note... Pizza Loves
Emily, Joseph Leonard, Pastis, Au Cheval, 4 Charles and Due West

Cheers to "Built For Change" and a special night!
Kyle
