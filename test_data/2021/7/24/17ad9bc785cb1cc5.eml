Unfortunately Yvonne is required to have a business page for
her....business. So I set up a 1-page site (like the rest of the agents in
our business) that is connected to her personal page (but somehow
separate). I can't see that anyone not logged in as an administrator can
see how many "likes" there are, but it's disturbing. And I don't know what
it means. None of the likes has left any feedback, messages, or tried to
post anything. I'll ask Shanti, he has to have an internet connection for
his business.  Thanks anyway honey.
