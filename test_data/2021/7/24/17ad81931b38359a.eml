Not sure what to advise here; Facebook is mostly spammers/bots, so this is
hardly surprising, but I'm not clear on if it's a negative or not. Can
other people see who is following you? it could be you're just caught in
the drift of some bot which is trying to get credentialed as having
relationships in CA - I.e., it might not be a net negative to you.

xoxo,
Josh
