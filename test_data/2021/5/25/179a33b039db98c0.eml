Hey Rosey, just looping back around to see where you're at on the NFT
project. The space is shaking out in all kinds of interesting ways; I
recently held a clubhouse session for a group of CMOs who are pitching a
Prediction NFT to a group of 10k senior executives, so corporate interest
is definitely growing. Let me know if you have any more concrete plans in
place and/or if I can be of any help!

All best,
Josh
