Joaquin,

I wanted to introduce you to Jeff at Carve Systems (cc'd). They're one of
the best firms around for the type of work you need done, and I've already
had a conversation with Jeff to confirm availability and to outline the
needs of the project.

I also took the liberty of asking for a referral from one of their clients
in S. America; please feel free to contact Felipe Schiappacasse, Lead
Offensive Security Engineer at Cornershop (shapa@cornershopapp.com)
regarding.

Please coordinate with Jeff directly to set up a time to review the
project; I'm happy to sit in on the call if you think it's useful, or let
me know if I can be helpful in any other way.

Apologies for the long lead time on this - it's been a crazy time for tech
these last few months!!

- J
