Thank you for the introduction Josh, and nice to meet you Joaquin. If
possible, I would love to grab a few minutes on your calendar to get a
better idea of your information security program as it currently exists and
how we might be able to help. I have availability 9-11 am and 2-3 pm MST
Wednesday and Thursday this week and 12-4pm MST Friday. Does anything in
that range work for you?
