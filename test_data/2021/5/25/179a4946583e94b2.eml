Hi Josh - these days I'm a reporter at Grist - a climate focused magazine.
But the pandemic has left me struggling to maintain interest and focus in
big abstract things like journalism - and I've been taking refuge in the
small and concrete - I've become something of a neighborhood handyman,
really enjoying working in the physical world, fixing things with my hands.
Enough so that I'm exploring an electrical apprenticeship.

So happy to chat! My initial thought is that my interest in physical/local
makes collaboration difficult, but on the other hand, I'm in a state of
searching right now.

Best
Nate
