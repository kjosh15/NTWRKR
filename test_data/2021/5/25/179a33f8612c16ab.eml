Andrew,

Two quick questions:

Firstly, an L&D reseller of ours is being bought by EY, who audit our
mutual customer (35k employees). This is going to leave them in the lurch
for L&D resources to integrate with our platform; do you have any materials
aimed specifically at large clients like this which can address leadership
coaching specifically?

Secondly, is it possible to get an intro to Josh Bersin? We did an event
together way back when Michel Koopman was at GetAbstract but have lost
touch. I'd like to get his take on Deloitte and to learn more about Bersin
Academy.

All best,
Josh
