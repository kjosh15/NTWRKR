Maille,

Great talking to you earlier today; it was really refreshing to chat with
an executive who has such a firm grip on the role, requirements, and
potential impact of different kinds of innovation!!

If you're game, I'd love to learn more about your new regulatory / controls
project. I'm especially curious about its potential as an exportable
framework for the burgeoning wave of (esp. crypto) fintech startups.

Finally, as requested I've attached a deck about my own platform
<http://www.indigometrics.com>, aimed at measuring and managing employee
behavior algorithmically. It's outside of my remit as an advisor for W50
but feel free to grab me at josh@indigometrics.com with any questions.

Sincerely,
Josh
