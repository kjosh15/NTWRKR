Jaron,

No new news on the TV front yet, but in the meantime I've got another
question I thought you might find intriguing.

I've built a platform <http://www.indigometrics.com> using peer-to-peer
surveys to create statistical models of behavior organized around core
corporate values. We're starting to get data at scale (three companies with
>35k employees) and it's producing interesting second-order effects.

If you're game, I'd love to compare notes, especially from an
ethical/developmental perspective. As much as we've built the platform to
serve employees first (we do a lot of I&D), we're seeing increasing ways to
change their behavior. KPMG and now EY is starting to express interest, so
if we're going to make substantive changes now is the time.

Let me know if you think a conversation would be interesting!

All best,
Josh
