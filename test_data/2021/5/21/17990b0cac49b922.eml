Spoke with a friend who's doing some pretty deep crypto stuff for some of
the bigger players in the US. He pointed out that China is already putting
pressure on foreign transactions by forbidding certain wallets from
validating from certain IP address blocks - i.e., EU wallets are getting
more expensive to maintain if they need to transact with US accounts as the
majority of bitcoin validators are in China (i.e., it becomes more
expensive to process transactions to the US than to Asia).

It's essentially forced, selective inflation. It'll eventually be worked
around, but in the short term it's an excellent example of surreptitious
pricing pressure... and it isn't a particularly elegant one, either.
Welcome to the future we predicted...
