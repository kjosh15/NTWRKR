OK, here's the bad news: NiftyGateway isn't going to help us as they're
hyper-focused on their current roster.

The good news is we may well be on to something. There are already
blockchains tied into prediction markets - https://numer.ai/ (prediction
markets for the stock market) is an example. But nobody has used NFTs to
create a general NFT prediction statement with inheritable value.

In terms of platform, we could do it anywhere, but I was pointed at
https://foundation.app. I'd suggest we enable a purchasing pool (if we can
find a way to make it easy) so that novice buyers can go in on a "W50
member prediction purchase" to mitigate risk.

Do we want to mess with working with foundation.app to make something
slightly new (including profit split to all members of the original
clubhouse + a potential group buy), or just go bravely forward with the
platforms you've already identified as a regular NFT?

Onward!
