Michel,

So good catching up yesterday; I'm delighted to see such concurrence in
where we're both working. Firstly, thanks for the intro to Bob yesterday!
Looking forward to learning more about Bond.

Separately, you mentioned several potential introductions. I did some
digging and wanted to follow up on:

- Pilot.coach: I'd love to talk to Ven Brooks if you are comfortable
connecting us; it seems like there's great synergies here. I've included a
short intro paragraph below.

- Ditto on www.udemy.com and degreed.com; these both look like great
matches, if possible.

Finally, let's set a time to talk again about how you could help
Indigometrics following my call w/ Bob reg. Bond.

Stoked!
Josh

###

Josh co-founded Indigometrics after fifteen years doing emerging tech
development for everyone from the CIA to Verizon to Merck. The platform
uses peer-to-peer measurement and management to connect core corporate
values to desired changes in behavior, and from behavior to personalized
options for improvement. Their clients' biggest ask is for L&D material
that can take advantage of the data-driven personalization our platform
provides, and they're looking for partners.
