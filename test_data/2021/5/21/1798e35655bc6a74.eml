Grace, thanks so much for the intro! And as ever, so glad the trip to NYC
yielded such dividends... (To bcc.)

Michael, pleased to meet you. I'd be happy to connect; let me know if any
times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or suggest something that
works for you GMT. Looking forward to it!

All best,
Josh
