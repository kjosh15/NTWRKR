FWIW, one of our side projects locally is looking at establishing a land
trust on which we can put carbon-negative housing paired with a 6-month
visa in case of emergency (natural disaster or war). You want in? ;)

On a more serious note, this is the third time I've been asked about why we
don't just take a loan. Do you have time to help me understand what kind of
a loan we'd want to take? My expertise on what's currently available is
limited and the internets are specializing in obfuscation on this ATM.
