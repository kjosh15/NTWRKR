Thanks so much for this!! I couldn't find that article when searching for
help on the site, I'm sorry - what should I have searched for to locate it?

Separately, I'm assuming I need to unpause the campaigns after I schedule
them? I went ahead and did so, trusting they wouldn't start sending before
the scheduled date. Can you confirm?

Thanks!
Josh
