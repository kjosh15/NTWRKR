Yeah, no problem. I do want to make a master troubleshooting chart. I think
after we fix Elizabeth's case we'll know what to do. I can't tell from her
description whether she has "misbehaving servo syndrome" or "brownout". I
think her Arduino may be resetting on her. If she provides a video we will
know more.

Fuck, I don't know what's up with the servos from China this past couple of
years. I have some more expensive Japanese servos here (Futaba) and they
are amazing. They cost around $20 or $25 each, though. I'm also not 100%
sure they fit this version of the Crowbox, I'd have to look at them in my
CAD program. I ran some prototypes on them, I know that for sure.

If Elizabeth ends up with a fucked servo, we're going to probably have to
change the recommendation, which will raise the kit cost. What a bummer.

by the way- LOL at that picture of the raccoon stealing from that guy's
crowbox (on the Crowbox Google Group)
