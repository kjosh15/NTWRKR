Joshua,

In light of the summary: =E2=80=9Cthey don=E2=80=99t know=E2=80=9D, I think w=
e just go and wing it. We will take the info for the place we canceled and, i=
f we are open to choose, call them and rebook. Or, I=E2=80=99m sure we will n=
ot be the only ones in limbo, so I would think there will be assistance avai=
lable to find a place.

I haven=E2=80=99t winged it like this in forever - I=E2=80=99ve almost alway=
s been a belt and suspenders sort of traveler - except when we took you and D=
evon to Europe. And that was a lot of fun.=20

Love,
DAD
