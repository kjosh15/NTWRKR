Pursuant our call earlier today:

https://www.ft.com/content/88f47c48-97fe-4df3-854e-0d404a3a5f9a

This is pretty one-sided IMHO; it=E2=80=99s taking the view of regulators an=
d banks as paramount and discounting the many disrupter platforms (NFTs, for=
 ex.) and rogue actors (if you can call the GameStop debacle a rogue actor..=
.)

However, it does a pretty good job of suggesting how soft power imperatives a=
re likely to drive a proliferation of platforms and niche services across th=
e spectrum of smart contracts and smaller markets - which is what I was tryi=
ng to intimate in our call today.=20
