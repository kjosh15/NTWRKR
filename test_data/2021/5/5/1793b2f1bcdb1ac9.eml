Very interesting! Sounds like we could try:


The authors suggest when toddlers disobey, parents wait five seconds before
clearly repeating the request. If another five seconds go by without
compliance parents can ask if they need help. If another five seconds pass,
parents should then calmly and gently guide the compliance. If at any point
along the way the child does listen and obey, parents should
enthusiastically thank them for listening.


Xoxo,

Josh
