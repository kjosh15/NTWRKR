Interesting read!!

I agree with a lot of what was said here reg. the rate and scope of change,
but wonder at the accuracy of specific predictions. In my experience it=E2=
=80=99s
hard to predict specifically how tech-driven markets will evolve; NFTs are
a good example. Still, an excellent framing of some major drivers. I=E2=80=
=99m
curious how they generate their analysis!!

Thanks much for sending,
- J

> fees/allocations likely would experience lower returns because Alkeon
> charges different management fee rates for different classes of investors
> and may waive or reduce the advisory and incentive fees/allocations for
> some investors and thus the results shown reflect "blended" advisory fees
> and incentive fees/allocations. The results also reflect the reinvestment
> of dividends and income and a fund's profits or losses from new issues. A=
ll

re
> detailed historical performance information for a particular fund please

>
> Gross and Net Exposure. Gross exposure equals long exposure plus the
> absolute value of short exposure. For example, for 100 USD of capital, if=
 a
> fund is 150 USD long and 50 USD short, it means that gross exposure is 15=
0
> + 50 =3D 200 USD or 200%. Gross exposure is calculated using each positio=
n's
> gross market value as a percentage of the fund's total gross market value=
.
> Net exposure is the exposure level of the fund to the market at the prese=
nt
> time. It is calculated by subtracting the short percentage from the long
> percentage. For example, if a fund is 100% long and 25% short, then the n=
et
> exposure is 75%. Net exposure is calculated using each position's
> delta-adjusted exposure with currency positions excluded. A position's
> delta-adjusted exposure represents its market value times delta (the
> measure of the sensitivity between an option or derivative price and the
> underlying stock price).
>
> Comparisons to Indices. Alkeon believes that, although the Alkeon Funds
> are not benchmarked to any index, comparisons to certain indices may be
> useful in evaluating the performance of the Alkeon Funds. The MSCI World
> Index captures large and mid cap representation across 23 developed marke=
ts
> countries. With 1,586 constituents, the index covers approximately 85% of
> the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country. The MSCI A=
C
> World Index captures large and mid cap representation across 23 developed
> markets and 27 emerging markets countries. With 2,978 constituents, the
> index covers approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunit=
y
> set. The Alkeon Funds' portfolios contain equity securities and may consi=
st
> of securities issued by companies in different countries with varying
> capitalizations and fixed income and non-equity investments, including
> short sales of securities and margin trading, and are not as diversified =
as
> the securities (when aggregated) that comprise the MSCI World Index or th=
e
> MSCI AC World Index. Unlike the performance of the Alkeon Funds, the
> performance of the MSCI World Index and MSCI AC World Index do not reflec=
t
> the impact of fees or expenses. The index performance shown is on a price
> return basis only - it does not reflect dividends, the reinvestment of
> dividends or other income. Any such comparison between the performance
> results of the Alkeon Funds and the MSCI World Index and MSCI AC World
> Index should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future resul=
ts.
>
> Differing Investments and Investment Environments. Future investments wil=
l
> be made under different economic conditions and will include different
> portfolio securities. Members of Alkeon's investment team have changed an=
d
> may change in future. As a result, potential investors should not assume
> that they will experience investment performance comparable to that set
> forth herein.
>
> No Assurance of Investment Return. There can be no assurance that any
> fund's investment objective will be achieved or that an investor will
> receive any return on its investment in a fund. A fund's performance may =
be
> volatile. An investment should only be considered by persons who can affo=
rd
> a loss of their entire investment. Notwithstanding a fund's use of market
> hedges, the investment return and principal value of an investment in a
> fund will fluctuate and may lose money.

 this message is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to sel=

 of an investment in any fund managed by Alkeon or its affiliates (the &quo=

<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"></p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">An investment in the Al=
keon Funds involves substantial risks. No guarantee or representation is ma=
de that the investment program of the Alkeon Funds will be successful. An i=
nvestment in the Alkeon Funds should be considered speculative. It is possi=
ble that
 an investor may lose some or all of his or her investment. Past performanc=
e is no guarantee of future results.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">The performance results=
 for all funds shown above are net of fees and expenses. Those results may =
not correspond to the results of the other funds that Alkeon manages using =
similar strategies due to differences in, for example, the timing of invest=
or cash
 flows, different levels of management fees or performance-based fees and e=
ach fund&#39;s other expenses.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">References to strategy =
performance data (the &quot;Alkeon Growth Strategy&quot; or &quot;AGS&quot;=
) is from another investment vehicle which runs pari-passu to Alkeon Growth=
 Partners, LP (&quot;AGP&quot;) and follows substantially the same investme=
nt strategy as AGP. The other investment
 vehicle&#39;s performance represents the longest track record available fo=
r the Alkeon Growth Strategy with an inception date of January 5, 1998 (MSC=
I data is as of January 1, 1998) and reflects the deduction of the vehicle&=
#39;s actual fees and expenses during the
 period shown, including the deduction of a 20% incentive fee and a 1% mana=
gement fee charged to investors prior to March 1, 2004, a 1.5% management f=
ee charged to new investors beginning March 1, 2004 and a 1.75% management =
fee charged to all investors beginning
 July 1, 2011. AGP commenced operations in January 2003, and it is subject =
to a 20% incentive fee and management fees ranging from 1.25% to 2% dependi=
ng on the series of interests. AGS performance referenced above may have be=
en lower during certain periods
 had it been subject to similar fees as AGP.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">FactSet provided forwar=
d year EV/EBITDA for securities and indices. Only EV/EBITDA numbers that Al=
keon believes to be reasonable were used in calculations.
</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">Calculation of Estimate=
d Performance. The estimated performance results above for recent period en=
ds were prepared by Alkeon and have not been compiled, reviewed or audited =
by an independent accountant. Alkeon based the performance results for prio=
r years
 on audited financial statements for those years, but the information for r=
ecent, unaudited periods has not been audited and actual final results coul=
d vary materially. The performance results reflect each fund&#39;s returns =
as a whole (rather than the returns
 of a particular investor), and, for recent period ends, reflect estimates =
of that fund&#39;s advisory fees, incentive fees/allocations and expenses. =
An investor that is charged the highest level of management and incentive f=
ees/allocations likely would experience
 lower returns because Alkeon charges different management fee rates for di=
fferent classes of investors and may waive or reduce the advisory and incen=
tive fees/allocations for some investors and thus the results shown reflect=
 &quot;blended&quot; advisory fees and incentive
 fees/allocations. The results also reflect the reinvestment of dividends a=
nd income and a fund&#39;s profits or losses from new issues. All investors=
 may not be eligible to be allocated such profits/losses. For more detailed=
 historical performance information
 for a particular fund please contact Alkeon (212-716-6840 or <a href=3D"ma=
ilto:alkeon-info@alkeoncapital.com" target=3D"_blank" style=3D"font-family:=
Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">alkeon-info@alkeoncapital.com</a>). THE INFORMA=
TION PROVIDED IS HISTORICAL AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF FUT=
URE PERFORMANCE. The information contained herein has been obtained by sour=
ces
 believed to be accurate, but Alkeon makes no guarantee as to the accuracy =
or completeness thereof.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">Gross and Net Exposure.=
 Gross exposure equals long exposure plus the absolute value of short expos=
ure. For example, for 100 USD of capital, if a fund is 150 USD long and 50 =
USD short, it means that gross exposure is 150 + 50 =3D 200 USD or 200%. Gr=
oss exposure
 is calculated using each position&#39;s gross market value as a percentage=
 of the fund&#39;s total gross market value. Net exposure is the exposure l=
evel of the fund to the market at the present time. It is calculated by sub=
tracting the short percentage from the long
 percentage. For example, if a fund is 100% long and 25% short, then the ne=
t exposure is 75%. Net exposure is calculated using each position&#39;s del=
ta-adjusted exposure with currency positions excluded. A position&#39;s del=
ta-adjusted exposure represents its market
 value times delta (the measure of the sensitivity between an option or der=
ivative price and the underlying stock price).</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">Comparisons to Indices.=
 Alkeon believes that, although the Alkeon Funds are not benchmarked to any=
 index, comparisons to certain indices may be useful in evaluating the perf=
ormance of the Alkeon Funds. The MSCI World Index captures large and mid ca=
p representation
 across 23 developed markets countries. With 1,586 constituents, the index =
covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization i=
n each country. The MSCI AC World Index captures large and mid cap represen=
tation across 23 developed markets
 and 27 emerging markets countries. With 2,978 constituents, the index cove=
rs approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunity set. The A=
lkeon Funds&#39; portfolios contain equity securities and may consist of se=
curities issued by companies in different
 countries with varying capitalizations and fixed income and non-equity inv=
estments, including short sales of securities and margin trading, and are n=
ot as diversified as the securities (when aggregated) that comprise the MSC=
I World Index or the MSCI AC World
 Index. Unlike the performance of the Alkeon Funds, the performance of the =
MSCI World Index and MSCI AC World Index do not reflect the impact of fees =
or expenses. The index performance shown is on a price return basis only - =
it does not reflect dividends, the
 reinvestment of dividends or other income. Any such comparison between the=
 performance results of the Alkeon Funds and the MSCI World Index and MSCI =
AC World Index should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of futur=
e results.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">Differing Investments a=
nd Investment Environments. Future investments will be made under different=
 economic conditions and will include different portfolio securities. Membe=
rs of Alkeon&#39;s investment team have changed and may change in future. A=
s a result,
 potential investors should not assume that they will experience investment=
 performance comparable to that set forth herein.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">No Assurance of Investm=
ent Return. There can be no assurance that any fund&#39;s investment object=
ive will be achieved or that an investor will receive any return on its inv=
estment in a fund. A fund&#39;s performance may be volatile. An investment =
should only be
 considered by persons who can afford a loss of their entire investment. No=
twithstanding a fund&#39;s use of market hedges, the investment return and =
principal value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate and may lose mone=
y.</p>
