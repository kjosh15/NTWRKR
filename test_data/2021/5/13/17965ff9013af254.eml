Sure! Do you have an audio recording I could use to pull out a clip, or did
you have one in mind? Not sure if I or someone else hypothesized a future
outcome (I think I suggested that using NFTs for ransoming dox was going to
be a thing) but that could be a fun clip to NFT as it's a hedge against it
coming true - in which case you have proof that you heard/said it first.
Just an idea!
