ello, this is Rodion. I wrote to you in the summer about crows, remember? S=
orry for not writing for a long time, I was very busy with the project.<br>=
While I went back to the city to study, the birds went through the second s=
tage of training, they took peanuts from the device. Thanks, your advice he=
lped.<br><br>Now I&#39;m working on a neural network, I already have a netw=
ork that detects butts and opens the device, but this is only a demo versio=
n. I also began to make a model of my own device for training on cigarette =
butts. This is really very interesting. Recently I put the device back in t=
he city, and I am waiting for the crows to come again. What is your lot?<br=
><br>I recently came across another person who teaches corvids. You may hav=
e heard of him, this is Hans Forsberg (<a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/c=
hannel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA" rel=3D"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" t=
arget=3D"_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA</=
a>). He managed to train forty to assemble metal lids. And I think he also =
wants to start collecting cigarette butts. Have you seen him?<br><br>If you=
&#39;re interested, here&#39;s my neural network video - <a href=3D"https:/=
/fb.watch/4N1Uptgr84/" rel=3D"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer" target=3D"_=
blank">https://fb.watch/4N1Uptgr84/</a>. It is in Russian, but part of the =
video on the neural network can be understood without words)<br><br>Seen yo=
ur latest YouTube videos, it&#39;s great.<br><br>Respectfully yours, Rodion=
