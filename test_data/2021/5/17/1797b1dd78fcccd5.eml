If you wanted to make a proposal of 4-5 ideas we could execute for them,
here's what was in my notes after our conversations this weekend:


Legislation that lets you zone a certain number of summer houses per area
for residence as long as it=E2=80=99s made carbon negative.

Then bolster that with strict distance limits for summer houses

OR

Buy area for carbon neg self-sustaining houses along with 6-month visa in
emergency for as long as they=E2=80=99re maintained carbon negative.

Pitch to dev company and sell in beforehand


xoxo,
Josh
