TL;DR: Just keeping in your inbox; let me know when you'd have time to chat=
.

On our end things are progressing quickly; we're getting shedloads of
really, really, really interesting data (esp. across orgs) and are starting
on a project with Wharton to do some more analytics. Also, we've been
talking with a NYC-based firm on agile/innovation training being done with
w/ an I&D slant that you might be interested in. Let me know when you're
available to connect!

All best,
Josh
