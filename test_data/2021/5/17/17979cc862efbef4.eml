Not sure what "unlimited text and data" means, but 256kb is awful. That
said, it'll keep you from being lost and able to make calls (via Signal,
anyway), I think. My concern is that "unlimited" means "unlimited at
$2.00/minute foreign calling rates."

An alternative is to pick up a local SIM (Vodafone has a plan called
Frelsi) that's about $20 and covers unlimited talk/txt and 5GB data using
an icelandic #.

My suggestion is to try Magenta Max and if it doesn't work well (or if you
see crazy charges on your account) pick up a Frelsi SIM.

We'll call the hotel later today and let you know what we find out.

Love,
Josh
