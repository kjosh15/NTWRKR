Randy,

Thanks again for the conversation the other day - it was HUGELY helpful to
get a better idea of what family offices might look for / have to offer to
Indigometrics.

If we're looking to scale the company quickly and sell to a partner who can
afford us access to a large customer base of data (to allow us to focus on
feature development) it sounds as though we'd want to find a single family
office who was interested in our area of emphasis: algorithmically
measuring and managing behaviors within organizations.

To that end, I've attached our recent pitch deck and would suggest that our
website's short video <http://www.indigometrics.com> is probably the best
introduction. We see ourselves as "The Google Analytics of Culture" and
given the changes COVID has wrought are looking to scale fast and create a
new market category.

Let me know if you think it's worth a follow-up call, and as ever please do
let me know how I can be of help in return!

Very much obliged,
Josh
