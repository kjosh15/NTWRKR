Mike,

Good to finally connect; as mentioned in the World 50 Engage Call earlier
I've seen you on a number of similar events.

I spent a bunch of time talking with Padma about Takeda before she left as
CHRO and was curious to catch up with you on your take on ESG / I&D from a
data side. Let me know when you might have time for a brief call in the
next few weeks (I'm GMT); looking forward to it!

All best,
Josh
