Hey Grace, do you know Jeffrey Burrell (Director of Karma / Social Impact
and Executive Director of Riot Social Impact Fund)? I ask as I know Riot
Games has been having some big problems with I&D, and I thought they might
be a potential client for Indigometrics.

Otherwise what else is new on your end? Have had you in mind lately and am
curious where you're headed ATM!!
