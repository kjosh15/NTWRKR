Thanks, Valerie! Spotted that, it's great stuff!

Is there anyone internally who might want to talk about quantifying I&D /
employee behavior? I'm sitting on some pretty crazy tech (that
algorithmically monitors and helps shift employee behaviors at scale) and I
think Walmart would be a great fit.

Many thanks,
Josh
