Hi Josh, Yes, I do as I'm advising their team on some ethics work. He's in
+ out of the office the next two weeks, and let me check with him when he's
back. They run really lean and are in the midst of some internal org
structure transitions.

Also, the investor I told you about is Michael Kantor. He seems like the
kind of person who makes it his business to connect with people - meaning
he might be worth asking explicitly for intros or consider as investor
(maybe around $1M range). Do you want me to email connect you two in case
he's still in your neighborhood this week? And remember that he's not a
close personal friend, so this is only if it's remotely helpful to you.

Still chewing on ESG front. I took a look at your website right now, and
I'm wondering if it may be more effective to position the company directly
to where risks exists for a business or what the problem is that you can
solve- that might help drive urgency (solving an immediate problem) vs.
being seen as a nice to have.

And.. flew back to LA last night and will be here for a few days! Grace
