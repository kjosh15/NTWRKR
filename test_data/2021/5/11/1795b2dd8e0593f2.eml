This is excellent!! I'm due to speak to the CTO of Motorola soon; this
seems directly in line with the changes he's been making company-wide.
Would you prefer I pass this doc to him, or ask if he'd like to talk
directly?

On a different note, we're looking to get Indigometrics connected with
Workday. We're seeing a TON of consulting and integration work come out of
our platform that could be a powerful driver for them and are trying to get
positioned to talk about partnership.

Finally, in terms of our staffing needs, we're only 5 people so EVERYONE is
senior at this point. We're looking at publishing a couple big pieces (one
Wharton White Paper, one HBR article) in the next couple months and are in
serious discussions with four large multinationals, so hopefully we'll have
the capital in place for expansion soon. If you know anyone who is strongly
motivated by pioneering a data-led I&D approach with large organizations -
especially if they're strongly cloud development and/or data fluent - I'd
love to have an initial conversation to begin vetting.

Glad to hear you're busy with growth; it's exciting times in this space!!

- J
