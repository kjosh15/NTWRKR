Good seeing you on the I50 Summit call yesterday! I'd been meaning to get
ahold of you; if you recall, we had dinner in NYC at a cooking school event
W50 held some time ago. We had a spirited discussion around algorithmic
behavior change, and you really challenged my thinking - which has resulted
in some pretty interesting results on my platform
<http://www.indigometrics.com> around scaled, algorithmic measurement and
management of employee behavior.

We've got an HBR article underway and Wharton is working on a whitepaper,
but I get the feeling you might be able to poke some useful holes. Are you
game for a brief discussion regarding?

All best wishes,
Josh
