Hey Loren, just saw your article "No matter how grown-up you are..." and
loved it. It was the genesis of a great conversation with my kids about the
importance of play. Thanks!

I've been meaning to connect about measuring (and managing) culture and
behavior algorithmically as I've been working on some pretty interesting
tech in the space. Do you have time for a quick chat?

All best,
Josh
