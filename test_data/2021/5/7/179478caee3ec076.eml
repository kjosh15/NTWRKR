Mark,

I've got a platform <http://www.indigometrics.com> that's heading towards
hockey-stick growth from Fortune 400's looking to craft executive decisions
out of a ton of ongoing, industry-unique data, mostly under ESG initiatives
but also around innovation, distributed workforce, safety, etc. We're
looking for partners who can satisfy the consulting demand while we
continue to grow the data analytics.

HBR is about to publish a case study and Wharton's People Analytics' Team
is working on a whitepaper. KPMG has reached out to me and I'm already
speaking to Accenture's executive team, but I haven't worked with either of
their management teams before. I have worked with yours.

The byline is that we're the only solution in the market that measures (and
manages) employee behavior - not feelings - at scale, both autonomously and
algorithmically. Does this fit with Capgemini (or F212's) growth path? Let
me know if it's worth a discussion!

All best,
Josh
