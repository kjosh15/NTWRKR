Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple Support. We do apologize for the confusion. It seems that you added users to your services which result in a charge. Now the way this services works is, if its done within the billing cycle, it will credit the previous charges (which will be the credits you see on the bill) then it will charge for the services again accordingly with the new number of users (the month to month charge on bill). As for accounts added different days in the billing cycle credit was prorated for dates used.

I do hope this information is helpful, but If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this support request, by calling us at 310-841-5500, or by opening a chat in the AccountCenter. We are here 24/7 to assist you.
