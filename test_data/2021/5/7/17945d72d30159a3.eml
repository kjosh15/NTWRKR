*TL;DR: Three Questions: *

1. Know anyone who needs a test market (Iceland) w/ rabid gov't support *or*
a corporate podcast?
2. Have any advice on building a bidding war (between KPMG and Accenture)?
3. Can you help me sell the Serendipity Engine, my CGM project, and/or an
AI-led TV series?

*(see below for more details on all of these.)*

Please let me know if you have any ideas or are curious in connecting
regarding!

All best,
Josh

#######

I'm trying something different here to see if it makes more sense / is more
interesting to you as an advisor while still helping me articulate what's
on my plate. Here are my three main buckets:

1. *Immediate Capital:*

   - Accenture's Built for Change podcast is debating doing another four
   episodes,
   - I'm pitching a podcast series to World 50,
   - There's the potential for a US Intelligence agency retainer contract,
   - My "big name artist" friend who wanted to do an NFT is "working on it"
   - I've also been talking to Business Iceland, an Icelandic Gov't
   initiative to bring foreign capital to Iceland - my pitch to them is that
   Iceland is a great test bed for corporations to trial new markets (such as
   autonomous vehicles, distributed greenhouses, etc.)


2. *Indigometrics:*

Our new employees are providing a huge boost to our ability to meet
customer demand, and we're learning a ton from our three multinationals.
We're talking to four more large multinationals who are interested (and
will help us validate a better pricing model), and I'm about to do a bunch
of outreach off the back of a World 50 Summit.

Most interestingly, I had a call w/ the head of KPMG's R&D lab (thanks,
Serendipity Engine!) and he almost fell out of his seat when I explained
what Indigometrics did. He's very, very keen to get us working with them,
and his parting words were to warn me that KPMG was likely to try to buy
us.

I like smoke up my ass as much as the next person, but it's still great
validation that the consulting market, at least, represents a potentially
very good partner for Indigometrics. Now I need to use my relationship with
Accenture (given that I've met most of their executive team via the
podcast) to get a friendly bidding war in place... And secure more
customers!

3. *Fun and games*:

I'm looking to clear a few projects off my plate that I've been trying to
minimize my investment in as Indigometrics grows. Do you know anyone who'd
be keen on:

- The Serendipity Engine: this is the automated emailing system I put in
place to multivariate test who I've ever met that might be interesting to
talk to now. Joel Stein (award winning columnist) is looking to do an
article on it with me for HBR, but I don't know what to do with it beyond
that. I've got a ton of data, a methodology, and some rough platform
integration... I'm also talking to my book agent to see if this is a
potential thing. Do you have any ideas on where to take it next?

- CGM Project: this
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=sharing>
is the idea; unless I find someone who wants to run with this I'm planning
to send out some emails and see if it happens to get serious interest from
any of a handful of big corporates I know (J&J, Sutter Health, Abbott,
etc.) If so I'll have to find a way to staff up for the execution, but as
all of the actual work would be done by a couple primary partners I think
that's manageable. Again, do you know of a different/better route to
validation?

- C-Side TV Series: I developed a TV series hosted by GPT-3 (Microsoft's
biggest language model bot) to allow it to learn how to argue about
contentious issues with US citizens, on both sides of each issue. Then the
host will cherry-pick the most interesting ones to give Americans a
narrative for how to engage with ourselves. Jaron Lanier from Microsoft has
been very helpful with questions and may be keen to go forward as an
Executive Producer, but it's taking too long. Do you know anyone who might
want to run with this?

Very, very much obliged!!
- J
