llo, this is Rodion. I wrote to you in the summer about crows, remember? So=
rry for not writing for a long time, I was very busy with the project.<br>W=
hile I went back to the city to study, the birds went through the second st=
age of training, they took peanuts from the device. Thanks, your advice hel=
ped.<br><br>Now I&#39;m working on a neural network, I already have a netwo=
rk that detects butts and opens the device, but this is only a demo version=
. I also began to make a model of my own device for training on cigarette b=
utts. This is really very interesting. Recently I put the device back in th=
e city, and I am waiting for the crows to come again. What is your lot?<br>=
<br>I recently came across another person who teaches corvids. You may have=
 heard of him, this is Hans Forsberg (<a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/ch=

ank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA</a>). He mana=
ged to train forty to assemble metal lids. And I think he also wants to sta=
rt collecting cigarette butts. Have you seen him?<br><br>If you&#39;re inte=
rested, here&#39;s my neural network video - <a href=3D"https://fb.watch/4N=

work can be understood without words)<br><br>Seen your latest YouTube video=
s, it&#39;s great.<br><br>Respectfully yours, Rodion.<br></div>
