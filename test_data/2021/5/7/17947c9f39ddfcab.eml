=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Supply Chain 50x gathered yesterday for candid d=
ialogue with trusted peers.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09We hope these h=
ighlights continue to spark the insights and perspectives you need

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09S=
angeet Paul Choudary

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Founder, Platform Thin=
king Labs

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Sangeet Paul Choudary sparked a p=
rovocative conversation about how to adapt for a modern age that is challen=
ging conventional value chain strategies.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09L=
isten to the conversation ::

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/H-2021-Sa=
ngeetPaulChoudary-mp3/hdx3gs/796716187?h=3D9odmzBVwr7od3hmIrTR9SJQ51H-Ljhp8=
jvA1pgytqSY

Aggregating consumption and standardizing production :: Ac=
cording to Choudary, there are two factors that allow the shift of economic=
 activity away from traditional linear pipelines and toward more flexible, =
more agile platforms:=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Platforms aggrega=
te consumption. Companies that operate this way subsidize one portion of th=
e business in order to aggregate both data and consumption.=20

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09They also standardize production. =E2=80=9CThey embed =
themselves in different parts of the production value chain, and they stand=
ardize how production happens.=E2=80=9D In doing so=E2=80=94in pushing out =
third-party involvement=E2=80=94these platforms can =E2=80=9Ccreate an unde=
rlying industry-level infrastructure.=E2=80=9D=20

And, once it=E2=80=
=99s commenced, this is evidently a self-propelling cycle. =E2=80=9CThe rea=
son aggregation becomes valuable is because of data. =E2=80=A6 The more [a =
company] aggregates users, the more it is able to understand and manipulate=
 or inform their decisions.=E2=80=9D And the more those consumers are influ=
enced, =E2=80=9Cthe more suppliers and producers want to be a part of that.=
=E2=80=9D=20

Create an ecosystem :: In answer to a member=E2=80=99s ques=
tion about how consumer packaged goods companies can remain relevant and pi=
vot to platform-based operations, Choudary was sanguine that this particula=
r sector has a rare chance to leverage its position in the market. =
=E2=80=9CTo a large extent,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CCPGs have this uniqu=
e opportunity of extending their brand from being a product-driven experien=
ce to an ecosystem-driven experience.=E2=80=9D Incorporating technology tha=
t feeds into the customer journey allows for a more seamless transition int=
o the creation of an ecosystem.=20

Ripe for the platform economy :: =
=E2=80=9CThere are a variety of factors that determine when an industry is =
ripe for the platform economy,=E2=80=9D said Choudary. He listed these key =
considerations:=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Information is a core d=
river of value. He emphasized that industries where information cannot only=
 be commoditized but where it=E2=80=99s fully digitized are often the quick=
est and easiest to transform. =E2=80=9CThis is why media and content compan=
ies were the first to be impacted.=E2=80=9D=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09There is a high degree of openness and a low amount of regulation. =
=E2=80=9COpenness starts allowing the movement toward a platform economy.=
=E2=80=9D=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The key value-creating proces=
ses are digitized. New flows of data, increased innovation and optimized pr=
ocesses are best facilitated by cloud-based interactions within an enterpri=
se.=20

Unbundling and rebundling :: For a while, there was a trend towar=
d what Choudary called an =E2=80=9Cunbundling=E2=80=9D of services. In the =
financial industry, for example, banks were being =E2=80=9Cattacked=
=E2=80=9D by smaller fintech entities, which provided niche services that p=
icked apart traditional offerings proffered by large institutions. =
=E2=80=9CBut unbundling doesn=E2=80=99t create new business value in the ec=
onomy.=E2=80=9D Rather, real value is generated when companies =E2=80=9Ctak=
e these unbundled components and rebundle them around customer problems.=
=E2=80=9D=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Joyce Chang

=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Managing Director and Chair of Global Research, JPMorgan Chase=


=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Joyce Chang shared insights into the macro=
economic trends that business leaders should focus on in the years to come =
and how to find sure footing in today=E2=80=99s volatile economic climate.=


=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Listen to the conversation ::

=3D9odmzBVwr7od3hmIrTR9SJQ51H-Ljhp8jvA1pgytqSY

Cryptocurrency, the nex=
t subprime mortgage crisis :: Looking at the sheer size of the cryptocurren=
cy exchange, a striking parallel emerges for Chang: =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s $=
2 trillion. That=E2=80=99s exactly what subprime was right before the globa=
l financial crisis.=E2=80=9D Unlike the lending bubble, however, cryptocurr=
encies aren=E2=80=99t widely owned. Still, though the risk is heavily conce=
ntrated in one area of the market, she said, =E2=80=9Cthere has to be more =
concern, given the pace of acceleration we=E2=80=99ve seen and also because=
 it=E2=80=99s unregulated.=E2=80=9D Because there=E2=80=99s no FDIC supervi=
sion or guarantee and because there=E2=80=99s such an excess of liquidity f=
loating around, it=E2=80=99s incredibly difficult to discern fair valuation=
. Even comparing it to gold as a standard, there=E2=80=99s no real way to p=
in it down precisely, though JPMorgan Chase estimates that it hovers around=
 $37,000=E2=80=94well below where others place it. That estimate, of course=
, ignores the outsized influence of Elon Musk=E2=80=99s cryptic tweets. Cha=
ng joked that while the =E2=80=9Ctweets are always very interesting and do =
drive sentiment =E2=80=A6 we=E2=80=99re relying on different data.=E2=80=
=9D

A boom through 2022? :: With the U.S. government pouring $7 trilli=
on into the economy, roughly 30% of GDP, over the course of two years, the =
question on economists=E2=80=99 minds is: =E2=80=9CIs there going to be a s=
oft landing for this?=E2=80=9D This level of spending raises issues in the =
long term, Chang said, but for now, it signals a continuation of the curren=
t boom for at least the next 12 to 18 months. Certainly, =E2=80=9Cit=
=E2=80=99s not just one or two quarters, just at the pace at which spending=
 is going.=E2=80=9D Given the amount of stimulus pumped into the market, =
=E2=80=9Cbusiness should be looking pretty good.=E2=80=9D=20

The next co=
mmodity supercycle :: =E2=80=9CWith concerns about inflation, commodities a=
re the hedge you should do right now,=E2=80=9D Chang said. That being said,=
 there=E2=80=99s been a fierce debate among experts about whether the curre=
nt climate constitutes a commodity supercycle. While equity analysts are =
=E2=80=9Cmore bullish=E2=80=9D on the topic=E2=80=94leaning toward the idea=
 that, yes, it is a supercycle=E2=80=94fixed-income analysts argue that it=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Can outbreak from where we were.=E2=80=9D On the whole, =
the view is, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re probably in a cycle that does have furt=
her to go.=E2=80=9D=20

Some bright spots in a dark world :: Though she e=
xpressed concern about a wide range of issues=E2=80=94from the growing defi=
cit to bitcoin=E2=80=94she remained hopeful about the overall global econom=
y for a few reasons:

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09This is not a synch=
ronized recovery. China has already righted its ship; the U.S. is not far b=
ehind, and Europe will follow suit soon. =E2=80=9CIf this were a truly sync=
hronized global recovery, the fears of an asset bubble and rising bond yiel=
ds would be a lot higher.=E2=80=9D=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Ther=
e=E2=80=99s no deleveraging. =E2=80=9CThe corporate balance sheet for the S=
&amp;P 500 was estimated to be $2 trillion. A year ago, it was at $540 bill=
ion, so you don=E2=80=99t have that deleveraging that took place after the =
global financial crisis.=E2=80=9D =20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Unem=
ployment is far lower than expected. The unemployment rate, which spiked at=
 the onset of the pandemic in the U.S., is expected to be around 4.5% by th=
e end of the year. Consumer debt is also at a 40-year low.=20

Though the=
re was the =E2=80=9Csharpest move down ever in many ways, there=E2=80=99s n=
ow the sharpest move up ever.=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Jasm=
ine Crowe

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Founder and CEO, Goodr

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09In conversation with members, Jasmine Crowe delved =
into implementing, leveraging and monetizing blockchain with an eye for how=
 it will impact supply networks in the next decade and beyond.

Accountability culture :: Whereas so=
me may view the younger generations=E2=80=99 insistence on social justice t=
o be emblematic of =E2=80=9Ccancel culture,=E2=80=9D Crowe sees it more as =
=E2=80=9Caccountability culture,=E2=80=9D and she=E2=80=99s inspired by it.=
 As the CEO of a company that provides food to those who need it most, she =
draws energy from young, passionate employees who care about making the wor=
ld a better place. She sees Gen Z and millennial workers as holding busines=
s leaders to account for the claims they make. =E2=80=9CThey make sure that=
 businesses are not just making these one-time donations, not making these =
one-time statements,=E2=80=9D that =E2=80=9Cthere=E2=80=99s empirical data =
to back up what it is [companies] say they=E2=80=99re doing.=E2=80=9D Those=
 talented young people want to know: =E2=80=9CWhat are the causes you=
=E2=80=99re supporting? How do you value women? How do you value people of =
color? What do you think about the environment?=E2=80=9D As the leaders of =
corporations, in order to attract that talent, =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=99ve got =
to be doing the right things.=E2=80=9D=20

Meaningful work :: Because she=
 works toward trying to eliminate the pervasive problem of hunger, Crowe co=
uld easily find herself despairing that there are still millions who go to =
bed with rumbling stomachs every night. Instead, she finds hope and solace =
in the letters and emails she receives from those she=E2=80=99s able to hel=
p. =E2=80=9CDo I feel like we have a lot more work to do? Absolutely. =
=E2=80=A6 But when I read these cards and these emails, I can only be hopef=
ul that I could do this for more people.=E2=80=9D Of her team at Goodr, she=
 said, =E2=80=9CWe really do give people hope in their darkest hours, and i=
t=E2=80=99s an incredible feeling to do this work every day.=E2=80=9D=20

Be aspirational and authentic :: As employees across the globe conti=
nue to be mired in the realities of living through a pandemic, Williams sai=
d, =E2=80=9COne of the most important things is to show up authentically to=
 your team and let them know that they=E2=80=99re not the only ones who are=
 feeling stress and challenges.=E2=80=9D When their workplace is also their=
 home, =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s easy for people to seek refuge [in work] and n=
eglect their other responsibilities,=E2=80=9D such as taking care of their =
physical and emotional well-being. It=E2=80=99s incumbent on leaders to dem=
onstrate the kind of healthy behaviors they=E2=80=99d like to see their tea=
ms exhibiting.

Speak plainly and directly :: In the context of a crisi=
s, Williams said, leaders must =E2=80=9Ctalk to their organizations in plai=
n English.=E2=80=9D Among those who flounder, there is a tendency to rely o=
n =E2=80=9Cgobbledygook,=E2=80=9D which may stave off discomfort for a whil=
e, but it inevitably maddens employees who can see through it quite easily.=
 Delivering bad news is undeniably difficult, he conceded, but =E2=80=9Cit=
=E2=80=99s how you communicate with people directly=E2=80=94and, frankly, i=
n a way that makes them feel like you are concerned with them=E2=80=9D that=
 makes all the difference.

Combating cultural entropy :: The longer of=
fice workers are away from the physical office, the more the cultural glue =
that held them together =E2=80=9Cmelts away slowly.=E2=80=9D To fight again=
st this, Williams suggested that members come up with =E2=80=9Cways to rein=
vent the watercooler in this virtual world.=E2=80=9D He encouraged them to =
spend the first five to 10 minutes of each conversation reestablishing pers=
onal connections. =E2=80=9CBuilding up that personal connection causes peop=
le to really believe they are not an instrument of execution of work; that =
yes, there=E2=80=99s work to be done, but they=E2=80=99re part of a team th=

From functionalists to generalists :: =
=E2=80=9CGeneralists are better at leading businesses,=E2=80=9D Williams sa=
id, when asked what qualities are most sought after in a CEO. Therefore, as=
 a functionalist in the supply chain realm, =E2=80=9Cyou have to back-solve=
 for the skills and competencies that the CEO has to have.=E2=80=9D In orde=
r to get to that point, =E2=80=9Cyou need to think about taking assignments=
 outside of your lane.=E2=80=9D Another possible route to the top involves =
seeking out openings at companies =E2=80=9Cwhere the core competency of the=
 business is supply, and where your knowledge is, in essence, the general m=
anagement skill required in that business.=E2=80=9D

<b=

<em>Stewart Butterfield joined members for a conversation about the fu=
ture of work and relationships, how to lead a digital-first workplace, and =
rethinking communication, collaboration and culture for the future.&nbsp;</=

<p><stro=
ng>Fostering alignment ::</strong>&nbsp;The thing that had the biggest impa=
ct on his business, Butterfield said, was the =E2=80=9Cenormous rush for pe=
ople to create Slack accounts =E2=80=A6 so, the employees were as motivated=
 as they could possibly get.=E2=80=9D This, in turn, created a great sense =
of alignment throughout the company; however, not many other companies were=
 lucky enough to fare this well. Butterfield shared that in order to foster=
 this type of environment, executives should encourage their workforce to c=
ollectively focus their energy on a specific task, rather than multiple pro=
jects at once. =E2=80=9CEven if you=E2=80=99re not pointed in exactly the r=
ight direction =E2=80=A6 at least you=E2=80=99re moving.=E2=80=9D But, he s=
tressed that members should be cautious of their workforce performing hyper=
-realistically to the point where productivity rapidly declines.</p>

<=
p><strong>Asynchronous alternatives ::</strong>&nbsp;The fundamental challe=
nge of virtual meetings, Butterfield said, comes down to human nature, and =
despite losing the hourlong commutes, many employees are beyond their capac=
ity of dedicated time. He offered members two asynchronous alternatives tha=
t Slack is developing to help alleviate this pressure.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>=

=09<li><strong>Huddles:</strong>&nbsp;Similar to social media audio spac=
es, these are always-on audio channels that encourage spontaneous interacti=
on and keep employees updated about meeting topics.&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><st=
rong>Containers:</strong>&nbsp;Over the course of a few days, employees can=
 upload their slides, videos and documents for others to view on their own =
time. This allows individuals to mull over topics and formulate fleshed-out=
 responses by the time the meeting is held.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In=
novation requires risk-taking ::&nbsp;</strong>=E2=80=9CBy default, the way=
 organizations get structured =E2=80=A6 there=E2=80=99s not a lot of reward=
 for risk,=E2=80=9D Butterfield said. This stems mainly from how employees =
believe they will be assessed in their performance reviews and the belief t=
hat they have to be right on their first try. He stressed that this way of =
thinking is not conducive to innovation, and it will only stunt a corporati=
on=E2=80=99s growth. =E2=80=9CThe process of product development and things=
 that are going to lead to innovation requires giving ourselves space=
=E2=80=9D to experiment and take risks without the fear of penalty. &nbsp;<=

<p><strong>Space sustainability =
is critical ::</strong>&nbsp;Even with the vast amount of data collected fr=
om space, Stricklan stressed that there are still coverage gaps, which pose=
 a great deal of threat for satellite collision. This has led to many space=
 operatives having to make blind decisions due to their not having access t=
o an accurate picture of their domain and where their assets are in relatio=
n to others. To mitigate this issue, Sticklan and Godwin=E2=80=99s team are=
 developing technologies to ensure space remains a safe and secure gateway.=
 =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s imperative that they know where their orbital object=
s are,=E2=80=9D said Stricklan, because when =E2=80=9Cthings crash in orbit=
, they don=E2=80=99t fall down =E2=80=A6 they stay up there, and they cause=
 other crashes, and it=E2=80=99s irreversible. =E2=80=A6 That=E2=80=99s why=
 space sustainability is so critical.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Re=
gulating Earth=E2=80=99s orbit ::</strong>&nbsp;The emergence of Starlink=
=E2=80=94an internet constellation consisting of thousands of small satelli=
tes=E2=80=94has led many members to wonder if there will ever be a governin=
g body that regulates what enters Earth=E2=80=99s orbit. Stricklan shared t=
hat some regulation already exists, but the extent of it depends on the orb=
ital domain. For instance, lower Earth orbit, where most human spaceflight =
takes place, isn=E2=80=99t as regulated as geostationary Earth orbit, where=
 it=E2=80=99s required to buy real estate to place communication satellites=
. =E2=80=9CBut, there is not one entity right now other than the U.S. Space=
 Force that helps with space tracker management.=E2=80=9D Congress, however=
, has put out guidance that the Department of Commerce may assume that mant=
le, =E2=80=9Cbut no one has formally stood up and said, =E2=80=98I am takin=
g this. This is how we=E2=80=99re going to do it, and
this is when we=
=E2=80=99re going to do it.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Avo=
id handcuffing the space economy ::</strong>&nbsp;In a discussion about pot=
entially clearing the surplus of satellite debris, Stricklan said there are=
 initiatives currently working toward this, such as the U.S. debris mitigat=
ion plan and Astrascale=E2=80=99s debris-removing prototypes. While these p=
lans do sound promising, there are regulations stating that countries are o=
nly allowed to clean up their own debris. =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve got to wor=
k on the regulatory environment, but we don=E2=80=99t want to work so hard =
=E2=80=A6 that we handcuff the space economy,=E2=80=9D said Stricklan. The =
GPS system, internet connectivity and card transactions are many of the ess=
ential, everyday things that rely on the network of communication satellite=
s, and the last thing anyone wants is for those to be disrupted.&nbsp;</p>=

<p><strong>Setting the scene ::</strong>&nbsp;Beachler is =
well-versed in building both mundane and fantasy worlds for the films she w=
orks on, and she shared that she doesn=E2=80=99t approach them differently.=
 Instead, she approaches each setting with a thorough amount of research ab=
out the location, its history and its people. From there, she allows the st=
ory to speak to her and guide her in a direction not weighed by her own wan=
ts. =E2=80=9CI always remember that you have a Woody Allen New York, and yo=
u have a Martin Scorsese New York,=E2=80=9D said Beachler. =E2=80=9CThey=
=E2=80=99re both New York, but they=E2=80=99re coming from two very differe=
nt people. So, you have to approach the place in that manner depending on w=
hat the story wants.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reenergizing creati=
vity ::</strong>&nbsp;Recalling how she navigated her career through the CO=
VID-19 pandemic, Beachler shared an important lesson she learned: =E2=80=
=9CEvery experience has to be a learning experience, whether it=E2=80=99s g=
ood or bad.=E2=80=9D So, to create more positive energy and motivation, she=
 took to self-care at home and found creative outlets for herself that gave=
 her something that she felt had been stripped from her. More importantly, =
she had to learn how to give herself grace in order to be the most creative=
 she can be. Said Beachler, =E2=80=9COnce I figured out how to reenergize m=
y creativity on my own and not just going into another situation where I=
=E2=80=99m going 1,000 miles an hour, I realized I=E2=80=99m more creative =
and imaginative.=E2=80=9D This, in turn, allowed her to be more graceful wi=
th her team and helped them reenergize their own creativity.&nbsp;</p>
=

<p><strong>Getting the resources ::</strong>&nbsp;Beachler offered membe=
rs three successful tricks she=E2=80=99s used to help acquire the necessary=
 resources for a project:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
=09<li><strong>Farming:&nbs=
p;</strong>Instead of asking for resources outright, drop seeds of ideas ar=
ound the office and let them grow. Eventually, some peers may bring it up i=
n a meeting, and the probability of approval may be much higher.&nbsp;</li>=

=09<li><strong>Building excitement:&nbsp;</strong>Show enthusiasm about =
the idea and help build the bigger picture for them. The only way for other=
s to believe it is if the one proposing it shows that they believe it, too.=
&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><strong>Horse trading:</strong>&nbsp;At the end of the=
 day, it all comes down to compromise. =E2=80=9CSometimes you have to give =
up your babies. Sometimes you have to be able to edit and pivot,=E2=80=
=9D and the quicker it=E2=80=99s done, the better.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

=
<p><strong>Taking a nonlinear point of view ::</strong>&nbsp;After leaving =
her corporate job of five years, Beachler discovered that she works best in=
 a nonlinear work environment. To put it in perspective, she said, =
=E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t shoot a script from the first scene to the last s=
cene. We shoot from the middle, the end and all over the place.=E2=80=9D An=
d while this may seem like a crooked approach in the corporate world, it al=
lows leaders to see different perspectives at different times, and it allow=
s teams to stretch their ideas beyond the business=E2=80=99s traditional bo=
undaries. Said Beachler, =E2=80=9CView everything in a nonlinear way when y=
ou go into the world =E2=80=A6 and see what that does for you creatively.=

p><strong>Facing the fear of failure ::</strong>&nbsp;Executives charged wi=
th innovation face an array of challenges, but the most daunting of them al=
l is the fear of failure, which, in turn, reduces the amount of risk they=
=E2=80=99re willing to take. And while reducing risk may appear to raise th=
e probability of success, Khosla said it=E2=80=99s futile, because =
=E2=80=9Cthe consequences of success are mostly inconsequential.=E2=80=
=9D Instead, members should embrace risk-taking, regardless of if failure i=
s more likely, because it will continue to drive innovation. Otherwise, bus=
inesses may remain mining for silver without knowing that gold sits right n=
ext to them.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding marginal innovations ::</strong>&=
nbsp;With many older companies having already survived pivotal shifts and i=
ndustry disruptions, they are often more reluctant to adopt new methods of =
innovation. Khosla stated that there are two future paths businesses can ta=
ke when stuck at this crossroad: =E2=80=9CYou can extrapolate the past with=
 minor innovations =E2=80=A6 or you can invent the future you want.=
=E2=80=9D But, he encouraged members to choose the latter and not rely on o=
lder precedents for future guidance. The reason? He believes some major bus=
inesses that choose to extrapolate their past tend to pick up marginal inno=
vations. =E2=80=9CAnd there is a role for that in society, but there=
=E2=80=99s a much larger business opportunity=E2=80=9D for taking greater r=
isks to drive success.&nbsp;</p>

=E2=80=9CKessler Syndrome,=E2=80=9D which is a worst-case scenario and one =
of the reasons it is very important to have responsible behavior in space a=
nd manageable navigation around potential issues.</li>
=09<li>There is a =
big focus for us as leaders to have 50% back in the office by July 1. I am =
calling this season =E2=80=9Cthe transitional tension season.=E2=80=9D It's=
 everywhere in our lives.</li>
=09<li>In the U.S., we are currently allow=
ing 25% capacity in our office locations, but we are actually running at le=
ss than10%. We are learning what the concerns and barriers are to returning=
 to work that we need to resolve.</li>
=09<li>Our manufacturing units pra=
ctically worked throughout the pandemic globally. While our R&amp;D center =
in the U.S. is averaging close to 40% on any given day, our R&amp;D center =
in Shanghai has been running at 98%-plus for more than 10 months now.&nbsp;=
</li>
=09<li>Asynchronous collaboration is our answer to greater innovati=
on and fewer meetings.</li>
=09<li>The "hide self-view" feature on Zoom m=
akes your meetings more intimate and lessens the mental stress.</li>
=09<=
li>We need to be thoughtful before we launch collaboration. Write down in a=
dvance the problems you think need to be solved and bold innovations you th=
ink could be created and crunchy issues you think will come up. Then have e=
veryone comment, and then you can create a better meeting agenda.</li>
=
=09<li>We can even record our daily standups, and people can weigh in after=
 them around the world and not have to find a single time for a global meet=
ing.</li>
=09<li>We have measured statistically within our large project =
teams that were formed and working before lockdown that productivity actual=
ly improved by 5-10% when they were forced to work from home. But, those pr=
oject teams that were formed during lockdown were 40% less productive. This=
 was very repeatable across multiple projects.</li>
=09<li>The problem is=
 not virtual; it=E2=80=99s not doing purposeful bonding and connection work=
 while virtual.</li>
=09<li>It is clear that the teams that had relations=
hips and bonds were very effective when they became virtual=E2=80=94at leas=
t in the beginning. It has deteriorated somewhat over the last 18 months. T=
he teams that were formed in the virtual environment on day one had a reall=
y difficult time developing similar relationships, especially trustfulness =
in each other. Trust is critical.</li>
=09<li>Human connection used to ha=
ppen serendipitously, and people didn't recognize that it=E2=80=99s worth i=
t to do purposefully. Simple practice is to start a meeting with everyone b=
y just asking them to add in chat what their energy levels are, or a quick =
check-in of something you are struggling with personally or professionally.=
 Accelerated vulnerability in small doses.</li>
=09<li>These trust connec=
tions were subliminal when teams worked together=E2=80=94physically togethe=
r=E2=80=94every day. In the virtual workplace, they are becoming stretched =
and strained, even in teams that know each other very well. For those who d=
on=E2=80=99t know each other, it=E2=80=99s really nonexistent.</li>
=09<l=
i>We are evaluating incentives that balance "learn fast,=E2=80=9D as well a=
s ways to put in mechanisms to encourage lifelong learning at all levels, i=
n addition to traditional ROI measures.</li>
=09<li>Personally, I don=
=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s a binary innovation choice between large, inc=
umbent companies versus small startups. It=E2=80=99s a spectrum on the inno=
vation ecosystem.</li>
=09<li>No =E2=80=9Cnew=E2=80=9D materials or chemi=
