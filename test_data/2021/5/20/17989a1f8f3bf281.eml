A couple weeks won't lose anything, but a couple months would - that's the
piece I was missing. I'll give it some more time and look to talk w/
Jennifer R. as a follow up; this is super helpful!!!

Separately, are you following what Jeremy is working up for the NFT
project? I'm pushing for a connection to the Winklevii and am planning to
drop the W50 name as an audience. It could be quite a thing if we minted
the first NFT prediction - prediction markets have been around and seeking
traction for ages! (OTOH, based on recent market results for crypto, this
could be quite a nothing...!)

All best,
Josh
