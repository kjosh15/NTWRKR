Hello dear Josh,

I shared a little bit about Michael Kantor (my guy William's friend). He's
back from Iceland, and I thought it might be meaningful for you two to
connect.

Michael, Josh is a dear friend of many years. Once upon a time, a friend
and I produced the first prototypes of the now TEDx model, Josh was a
presenter. It was thanks to Josh's invitation to NYC that I met someone who
was incredibly influential to my life. Josh, did we talk about that?
Wendell and Anthony were part of the founding team of Ethereum. It was
Wendell who believed in me and connected me to transformative ideas and
opportunities.

Josh is working on some really interesting and meaningful projects, so
perhaps there'll be some cross over.

Happy Connecting!
Grace
