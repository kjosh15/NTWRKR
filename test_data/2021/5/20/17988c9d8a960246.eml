*TL;DR: **Know anyone at McKinsey, PwC, Deloitte, or EY? KPMG just went
gaga over Indigometrics and I'd love advice/connections in setting up a
bidding war.*


The long version:

Indigometrics is "doing the work"; building infrastructure, preparing media
properties, conducting outreach to potential partners, resellers, and
customers, etc. KPMG's R&D division is super excited (they say) and is
pushing hard to examine our platform, which has prompted us to refocus on
partnering with potential resellers. If you can think of anyone, please
connect us!

Personally, I recently got an invitation to discuss hosting a video series
for Microsoft, and am pushing another podcast series to pay the bills until
Indigo starts paying me a salary.

Entirely separately, we've been doing some work with Business Iceland, a
gov't marketing arm that's trying to attract foreign investment in
environmental initiatives in Iceland. If you know anyone who wants to try
out a fast-adopting test market with flexible legislation, let me know!

How about you? Anything I can do to help?

All best wishes,
Josh
