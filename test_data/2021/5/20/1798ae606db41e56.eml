Definitely thinking org-wide but primarily at (though not limited to) =
tech focused enterprises. Healthy engineering and product culture should =
be something that all staff-members feel apart of in every org despite =
their role. We=E2=80=99ve been leading a lot of programs helping both =
non-technical and technical team members enhance their work in these =
settings through practical immersion and leadership development =
workshops. To-date we=E2=80=99ve done programs that have been team =
specific for up to 20-30 folks at a time, but we can easily scale our =
programs and structure the content in ways that can be done org-wide. =
For example, we're working on content for all-staff workshops on topics =
like Design Thinking, Engineering Culture, and Technical Leadership to =
offer growing orgs in our network, but this is definitely the type of =
learning that could reach/impact more people especially at =
larger/established firms. Definitely think it would be interesting to =
understand more of how your platform helps companies identify the =
specific areas in which non-technical and technical members of their org =
may need more support and perhaps we can work together to offer tailored =
programming in our capacity based on the insights/recommendations your =
org provides your client-partners.

Appreciate the warm reply and hope you=E2=80=99re enjoying your day!

My best,

a potential talent pipeline to some tech jobs for his company and some =
others. I'm not sure if Floreo is actively doing bootcamps, but wanted =
to introduce you two nonetheless!

primarily at (though not limited to) tech focused enterprises. Healthy =
engineering and product culture should be something that all =
staff-members feel apart of in every org despite their role. We=E2=80=99ve=
 been leading a lot of programs helping both non-technical and technical =
team members enhance their work in these settings through practical =
immersion and leadership development workshops. To-date we=E2=80=99ve =
done programs that have been team specific for up to 20-30 folks at a =
time, but we can easily scale our programs and structure the content in =
ways that can be done org-wide. For example, we're working on content =
for all-staff workshops on topics like Design Thinking, Engineering =
Culture, and Technical Leadership to offer growing orgs in our network, =
but this is definitely the type of learning that could reach/impact more =
people especially at larger/established firms. Definitely think it would =
be interesting to understand more of how your platform helps companies =
identify the specific areas in which non-technical and technical members =
of their org may need more support and perhaps we can work together to =
offer tailored programming in our capacity based on the =
insights/recommendations your org provides your =
client-partners.</div><div dir=3D"auto" class=3D""><br =
