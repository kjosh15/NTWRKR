Joshua,

Just a quick note;  You may have trouble comprehending this - your mother aw=
oke shortly after 6:00 this morning and (instead of her more usual, =E2=80=9C=
don=E2=80=99t talk to me, I want to go back to sleep =E2=80=9C) said, =E2=80=
=9Clet=E2=80=99s get going =E2=80=9C. I was surprised but enjoyed an early m=
orning conversation, a bit of individual =E2=80=99Net surfing and we are wel=
l into starting our new day=E2=80=99s adventures. At 7:30 AM!

Love,
DAD
