Looping back around to see if this sparked any interest. We're starting to
get some attention from other parties even before the HBR article or
Wharton White paper, and have been approached by KPMG, Refinitive, and a
couple others. It feels like the time to put our foot on the gas is fast
approaching!

As ever - let me know if I can be of any help, and thanks again for the
consideration.

All best wishes,
Josh
