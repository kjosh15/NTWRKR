This is a loan - it's got good terms, b/c it's disaster relief, but it's
still a loan. Am I right in thinking we don't need the hassle (esp. given
that we live abroad and recently moved business addresses to Wyoming,
meaning there'd be a fair amount of research needed to make sure we're even
eligible?)

Dear Applicant,

Our records indicate that you have not responded to our invitation to apply
for your SBA Targeted EIDL Advance. This step is necessary to be considered
for the full Advance of $10,000, or the difference up to $10,000 if you
previously received the EIDL Advance last year. The smallest and hardest
hit businesses may also be eligible for an additional $5,000 Supplemental
Targeted Advance, see details below. *If you don't apply soon, you may be
missing out on an opportunity to receive as much as $15,000 in grant
assistance for your business that you do not have to repay.*

We understand the challenges your business is facing due to the massive
disruption caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and want to
provide you with funds to help with your recovery needs.

As we stated in our previous email, if your business is in a low-income
community, suffered greater than 30 percent economic loss and has 300 or
fewer employees, you are eligible to receive the Targeted EIDL Advance of
$10,000, or the difference up to $10,000 if you received a partial EIDL
Advance last year.

*Best chance to qualify:* The address we have on file for your business
meets the low-income community eligibility criteria, which means you are
among the most likely business applicants to qualify for the Targeted EIDL
Advance if you also meet the other eligibility criteria above for economic
loss and number of employees. SBA has provided a mapping tool to check to
see if your business address is in an eligible low-income community at
https://sbaeidl.policymap.com/app

*Additional $5,000 but act quickly:* If your business suffered greater than
50 percent economic loss and has 10 or fewer employees, you may also be
eligible for the Supplemental Targeted Advance of $5,000. The maximum
amount for all Advances combined, including the EIDL Advance, Targeted EIDL
Advance and Supplemental Targeted Advance, will not exceed $15,000. As a
reminder, the Advance funds do not have to be repaid and you do not have to
be approved for or accept a loan to qualify for the Targeted EIDL Advance
or the Supplemental Targeted Advance.

*What you need to do:* Our previous email to you contained a link to our
application portal that is unique to your business. That email may have
been overlooked or routed to a =E2=80=9CSpam=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CJunk=E2=
=80=9D folder. Please search your
Inbox, Spam or Junk folders for an email sent February 1, 2021 or later
from an account ending in =E2=80=9C@sba.gov=E2=80=9D. Once you find the ema=
il, use the link
to submit your application for the Targeted EIDL Advance.
