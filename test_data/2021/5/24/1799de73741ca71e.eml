Thanks Cam! We typically need groups of 50+ employees, and need to operate
for 3-6 months to establish baselines and produce strong trendlines... so
we're very much a longer-term engagement for a customer. That said, if
they're serious about making systemic change company-wide, you could have
ongoing insight into where/how to invest time with who to make an impact.
We've got a pretty good video here <http://www.indigometrics.com>, or happy
to talk further if you think we could work together!

All best,
Josh
