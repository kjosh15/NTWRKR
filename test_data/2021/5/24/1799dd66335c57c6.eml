+1 on the racoon. Epic.

I get the impression a lot of folks have the crowbox as a side-
side-project, which is ok (I guess) as long as they're still pursuing it.
Hell, we know it works (given the videos we're seeing from other creators)
- it'd be nice to see it on our hardware, though!!

I hear you on the servo issue. Not sure what else can be done, but it seems
pretty likely we're going to have more problems like this as the global
supply chain universe goes through its reshuffling after the last year. :/
