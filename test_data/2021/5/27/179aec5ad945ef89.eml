Hi Josh!

Great to hear from you! Sorry about my late response =E2=80=93 I've been of=
f the
grid for a little bit as I've been relocating to New York from SF during
the past week. I took some time off to recharge in Upstate New York before
setting up the new home in the city. I am currently working (remotely) at
Curology as Product designer =E2=80=93 our mission is to make skincare (and
prescription level acne treatment) accessible for everyone, and I've been
really enjoying my time here!

How are things with you? Glad to hear that you are still working on
Indigometrics, I like the new deck that you've put together since the last
time, and the other projects you are working on sound fascinating as well!
Are you still in New York? Would be happy to jump on a call or grab coffee
on one of the days if you are around!

Best,
Marre
