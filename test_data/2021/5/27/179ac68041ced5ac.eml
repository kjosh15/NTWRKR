What do I have to say about Swartz' death? Well, maybe a little bit, since =
Swartz is said to have suffered from=C2=A0clinical depression [https://emai=

pUP7pYVUGHaLbTh4rtD17Ahns]. I do know a little bit about this topic, since =
I myself have struggled with depression for over a decade. Mine was first t=
riggered by the sudden death of my mother in 1999, although I also have a f=
amily history of depression on my mom's side (the Swartz side, ironically, =
though I don't think Aaron and I were related).=C2=A0
Obviously, everyone's experience of depression is different, so I don't int=
end these thoughts to be a universal guide or general theory. Also, bipolar=
 disorder, or "manic depression", is another thing entirely. But that said,=
 here are my thoughts on depression.
1.=C2=A0Depression is not sadness.=C2=A0During the most intense part of a m=
ajor-depressive episode, what I've felt is nothing at all like sadness. Mos=
tly, it's a kind of numbness, and utter lack of desire and will. Underneath=
 that numbness, there's the sense that something awful is happening - there=
's a very small voice screaming in the back of your mind, but you hear it o=
nly faintly. There's an uncomfortable=C2=A0wrongness=C2=A0to everything, li=
ke the world is twisted and broken in some terrible but unidentifiable way.=
 You feel numb, but it's an incredibly bad sort of numbness. This is accomp=
anied by a strange lack of volition - if a genie popped out and offered me =
three wishes at the depth of my depression, my first wish would be for him =
to go away and not bother me about the other two. Looking back on this expe=
rience, I've conjectured that part of depression might be like some kind of=
 mental "fire sprinkler system" - the brain just floods the building comple=
tely to keep it from burning down.
Depressed people often remark that it's impossible to remember what depress=
ion is like after it's over, and impossible to imagine feeling any other wa=
y when you're in the middle of it. Therefore, most of what I'm saying here =
comes from things I wrote when I was in the middle of major depressive epis=
odes. I think my most colorful description was that depression was like "be=
ing staked out in the middle of a burning desert with a spear through your =
chest pinning you to the ground, with your eyelids cut off, staring up at t=
he burning sun...forever."=C2=A0
2.=C2=A0Coming out of depression is the most dangerous time.=C2=A0Coming ou=
t of depression, I've found, is like having your emotional system turned ba=
ck on. But when it's turning back on, it sputters and backfires. You feel i=
ncredibly raw. You have days where you feel elated, like you're walking on =
air. And you have days when you feel black despair, rage, hysterical sadnes=
s. These latter are the only times that I've seriously thought about harmin=
g myself. And I've done a few...unwise things during these periods.
One of the most common negative episodes, for me, is what I've heard people=
 call the "spiral" - a flood of negative emotions makes you feel like you'r=
e bringing down the people around you, which triggers more negative emotion=
s, etc. I often experience this when coming out of depression. It comes on =
very rapidly. If you see this happening to a depressed person, get them awa=
y from large groups of people and high-energy social situations, as fast as=
 possible.
3.=C2=A0Depressed people don't need good listeners, a sympathetic ear, or a=
 shoulder to cry on.=C2=A0Most of the time, when our friends are having lif=
e problems, what they need is a sympathetic ear. They need someone to liste=
n to their problems, to understand and accept the validity of their feeling=
s, and to empathize. So when our friends have depression, the natural urge =
is to sit there and listen, and ask "What's it like?", and "Why do you feel=
 that way?", and to nod, and make a concerned face, and tell them you under=
stand (even though you don't), and to give them a hug. This is a good impul=
se, but when the person is depressed rather than sad, it's a completely mis=
placed impulse. This is=C2=A0not=C2=A0what depressed people need, and altho=
ugh it doesn't hurt them, in my experience it doesn't do them any good at a=
ll. One reason is that depressed people tend not to think that anyone can r=
eally understand what they're going through (and in fact it's very hard for=
 a non-depressed person to understand, thank God). Another is that, while f=
or a normal sad person, getting negative thoughts out in the open helps exp=
unge them, for depressed people airing the negative thoughts just forces th=
em to=C2=A0think=C2=A0their negative thoughts, without expunging them. Anot=
her is that the emotional disconnection that I mentioned in point 1 tends t=
o short-circuit the warm, good feeling that usually comes from someone bein=
g sympathetic and friendly toward you.
4.=C2=A0Depressed people=C2=A0do=C2=A0need human company.=C2=A0For some rea=
son, human company helps. In fact, it is the single thing that helps the mo=
st. But not the kind of company a sad person needs. What a depressed person=
 needs is simply to talk to people,=C2=A0not=C2=A0about their problems or t=
heir negative thoughts or their depression, but about anything else - music=
, animals, science. The most helpful topic of conversation, I've found, is =
absurdity - just talking about utterly ridiculous things, gross things, vul=
gar offensive things, bizarre things. Shared activities, like going on a hi=
ke or playing sports, are OK, but talking is much, much more important. I r=
eally have never figured out why this works, but it does.And of course, rel=
ationships are very, very important. Friends, I think, are the most importa=
nt, because friends offer opportunity for understanding and positive intera=
ction without much feeling of obligation or shame (see point 6). Family and=
 lovers are important, but really, the friendship component of these relati=
onships has to dominate, so the depressed person doesn't constantly think n=
egative thoughts about how they've let you down. Essentially, to help a dep=
ressed person, friends need to become a bit more like family, and family a =
bit more like friends. Also, you should realize that just because your depr=
essed friend or family member is unresponsive, that doesn't mean that you a=
ren't doing him or her a lot of good.
5.=C2=A0Cognitive behavioral therapy really works.=C2=A0I've taken one anti=
depressant drug (Lexapro), but it did nothing perceptible for me. (This is =
not to say that antidepressants in general don't work; for that, ask PubMed=
=2E This is just about my personal exper=
ience.) What has worked for me is cog=
nitive behavioral therapy. The "cognitive part" is the most important. Basi=
cally, depressed people have negative thoughts that they can't get out of t=
heir head; cognitive therapy teaches you to habitually identify, examine, a=
nd correct these negative thoughts. That really helps; once those negative =
thoughts aren't always racing unnoticed through the back of your mind, your=
 brain has a much easier time repairing the damage done by a depressive epi=
sode. Also, "behavioral" therapies can be important for improving your life=
style.=C2=A0
Cognitive behavioral therapy is best done by a counseling therapist, and th=
ere are many good therapists, but also many crappy ones. It is easy to see =
who is good and who is crappy, but since depressed people have low volition=
, sometimes they need a push to ditch a bad therapist and keep looking for =
a good one.
6.=C2=A0Depressed people may need a new "narrative".=C2=A0I've also called =
this a "new perspective", but I think the word "narrative" fits better. I'v=
e discussed my "narrative theory of depression" at length with psychotherap=
ists. Keep in mind that this theory of mine might be wrong, and even if it'=
s right, it might only be right for a subset of depressed people!
Basically, I think that the most important repetitive negative thought that=
 afflicts depressed people is=C2=A0negative self-evaluation. You think, in =
a very detached, dissociated way, "The person who I call 'me' is a worthles=
s person." And I think that the main criterion that we use to evaluate peop=
le is the=C2=A0narrative; a story that seems to unify and make sense of a p=
erson's life. Obviously, this is not a realistic or accurate method; human =
beings are not consistent, we are not simple, and we don't make sense. The =
narratives that we construct for ourselves are mostly bullshit. We construc=
t them out of a need to make sense of the world, not as rational scientific=
 theories that best fit the available data.=C2=A0
I feel like most people construct a narrative of their life that is basical=
ly positive. People tend to think that they are good, and also talented and=
 special, and that their life is progressing toward some purpose. We are ea=
ch the protagonist in our own story. This narrative gives them motivation, =
and also the overconfidence they need to take risks and exert effort (Ha! I=
 managed to slip in a behavioral econ reference after all!). People also st=
rive to fit their positive narratives. The part of people that conducts sel=
f-evaluations - the "internal performance review" component of the psyche, =
if you will - observes how well the person is living up to the positive nar=
rative, and tries to correct deviations.
But sometimes, for some reason, people become fixated on a negative persona=
l narrative. Instead of the protagonist or hero of the story of your life, =
you become the villain, or the tragedic failure. Instead of Luke Skywalker,=
 you become Oedipus. And because we construct our narratives to have false =
consistency, the negative narrative starts to color absolutely everything y=
ou do. You start to see every action you take as backed by bad motives, or =
as doomed to failure. You perceive every emotion as base and reprehensible.=
 The "internal performance review" part of yourself, whose task it usually =
to keep you toeing the line of the positive narrative, begins to throw up i=
ts hands and wish that it could just get rid of you completely.
Obviously, this could lead to some very bad things.
I believe that many depressed people are constantly afflicted by the crushi=
ng negative feedback of a negative personal narrative. And I've found that =
the biggest single thing that helps people out of depression is the scrappi=
ng of the negative narrative and its replacement with a positive alternativ=
e narrative. This is usually possible, because narratives are mostly constr=
ucted out of bullshit - replace the bad bullshit with good bullshit, and yo=
u win. But that is=C2=A0much=C2=A0easier said than done.
If you have depressed friends, you can, in theory, help them construct a ne=
w, positive narrative for themselves. But this is a very difficult thing to=
 do, because a coherent, believable narrative is a rare thing, and you neve=
r quite know what will stick and what will be rejected. The good news is, i=
f you try and fail, your depressed friend will be no worse off. Remember, d=
epressed people are weak-willed, they have low volition and little initiati=
ve; to help your depressed friend construct a new narrative, you have to be=
 pro-active. You've got to spontaneously volunteer positive perspectives on=
 his or her life, without being asked to do so.=C2=A0
This goes against our social instincts, since with a normal, non-depressed =
sad friend, doing this is kind of a mean thing to do; the friend just needs=
 you to listen and understand, not to contradict, reinterpret, and dismiss =
their pain. But a depressed person is not sad, and what they need is very d=
ifferent from what a non-depressed sad friend needs. I'm not saying you sho=
uld be an aggressive jerk, and berate your friends for thinking negative th=
oughts. Nor am I saying you should project fake sunny optimism about your f=
riend's life. It takes a lot more honesty than that, not to mention finesse=
 and creativity and careful guesswork about the nature of your friend's "ne=
gative narrative". So go slowly and carefully.
As for what=C2=A0kind=C2=A0of positive narrative to help your depressed fri=
end construct...well, this will be very different for each person, and it w=
ill depend on what kind of=C2=A0negative=C2=A0narrative they've constructed=
 for themselves. In general, though, I'd say that it's good to reinterpret =
past "failures" as necessary steps on the road to future successes. And it'=
s important to emphasize how much potential the depressed person still has =
in their future - like in the movie City Slickers, when Billy Crystal convi=
nces his depressed friend that he gets to have a "do-over" in life. In gene=
ral, if you can help a depressed person visualize a different and positive =
future, he or she will entertain the notion that his or her past "mistakes"=
 might have just been "Act Two" in a three-act romance, instead of the fina=
l act in a Greek tragedy.
Now, I am not saying that construction of this "new narrative" is a cure fo=
r depression. It is a complement to things like cognitive behavioral therap=
y, constant low-pressure human interaction, a healthy lifestyle, etc.
7.=C2=A0Depressed people always need to be vigilant against a relapse.=C2=
=A0Depression is like cancer - once you have it, it remits, possibly foreve=
r, but you are never "cured". Relapses are not certain, but the danger will=
 always be there. Therefore, after recovering from a depressive episode, a =
depressed person must change his or her life completely and permanently. Th=
e things that you did to get out of depression, you must=C2=A0never stop do=
ing=C2=A0for the rest of your life. You must permanently place a greater em=
phasis on human contact and on meaningful, positive, healthy relationships =
of all kinds. You must constantly think about what makes you happy and how =
to get it, and you must constantly take steps toward a positive future that=
 you envision for yourself. If you allow yourself to coast, or get stuck in=
 a rut, you will fall back into the pit and have to start all over again. A=
nd if therapy helped you, keep going to therapy forever. What's more, if yo=
u get out of depression, do lots of things to remind you about what got you=
 out of it. Turn it into a story of personal triumph, and repeat that story=
 to yourself. And never forget to solidify, cement, embellish, and elaborat=
e a positive narrative of your life.
Anyway, that's the short version of my thoughts on depression. The long ver=
sion could fill books. Maybe someday it will. In the meantime, remember, de=
pression is real. It's among the worst things that can happen to you. But i=
t is beatable.

about this topic, since I myself have struggled with depression for over a =
decade. Mine was first triggered by the sudden death of my mother in 1999, =
although I also have a family history of depression on my mom's side (the S=
wartz side, ironically, though I don't think Aaron and I were related).&nbs=

n: 0 0 1em 0;">Obviously, everyone's experience of depression is different,=
 so I don't intend these thoughts to be a universal guide or general theory=
=2E Also, bipolar disorder, or "manic de=
pression", is another thing entirely.=
 But that said, here are my thoughts on depression.</p><p style=3D"color: #=
1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">1.&nbsp;<st=
rong>Depression is not sadness.</strong>&nbsp;During the most intense part =
of a major-depressive episode, what I've felt is nothing at all like sadnes=
s. Mostly, it's a kind of numbness, and utter lack of desire and will. Unde=
rneath that numbness, there's the sense that something awful is happening -=
 there's a very small voice screaming in the back of your mind, but you hea=
r it only faintly. There's an uncomfortable&nbsp;<em>wrongness</em>&nbsp;to=
 everything, like the world is twisted and broken in some terrible but unid=
entifiable way. You feel numb, but it's an incredibly bad sort of numbness.=
 This is accompanied by a strange lack of volition - if a genie popped out =
and offered me three wishes at the depth of my depression, my first wish wo=
uld be for him to go away and not bother me about the other two. Looking ba=
ck on this experience, I've conjectured that part of depression might be li=
ke some kind of mental "fire sprinkler system" - the brain just floods the =
building completely to keep it from burning down.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a=
1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Depressed peo=
ple often remark that it's impossible to remember what depression is like a=
fter it's over, and impossible to imagine feeling any other way when you're=
 in the middle of it. Therefore, most of what I'm saying here comes from th=
ings I wrote when I was in the middle of major depressive episodes. I think=
 my most colorful description was that depression was like "being staked ou=

 the most dangerous time.</strong>&nbsp;Coming out of depression, I've foun=
d, is like having your emotional system turned back on. But when it's turni=
ng back on, it sputters and backfires. You feel incredibly raw. You have da=
ys where you feel elated, like you're walking on air. And you have days whe=
n you feel black despair, rage, hysterical sadness. These latter are the on=
ly times that I've seriously thought about harming myself. And I've done a =
few...unwise things during these periods.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; fo=
nt-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">One of the most commo=
n negative episodes, for me, is what I've heard people call the "spiral" - =
a flood of negative emotions makes you feel like you're bringing down the p=
eople around you, which triggers more negative emotions, etc. I often exper=
ience this when coming out of depression. It comes on very rapidly. If you =
see this happening to a depressed person, get them away from large groups o=
f people and high-energy social situations, as fast as possible.</p><p styl=

">3.&nbsp;<strong>Depressed people don't need good listeners, a sympathetic=
 ear, or a shoulder to cry on.</strong>&nbsp;Most of the time, when our fri=
ends are having life problems, what they need is a sympathetic ear. They ne=
ed someone to listen to their problems, to understand and accept the validi=
ty of their feelings, and to empathize. So when our friends have depression=
, the natural urge is to sit there and listen, and ask "What's it like?", a=
nd "Why do you feel that way?", and to nod, and make a concerned face, and =
tell them you understand (even though you don't), and to give them a hug. T=
his is a good impulse, but when the person is depressed rather than sad, it=
's a completely misplaced impulse. This is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;what depr=
essed people need, and although it doesn't hurt them, in my experience it d=
oesn't do them any good at all. One reason is that depressed people tend no=
t to think that anyone can really understand what they're going through (an=
d in fact it's very hard for a non-depressed person to understand, thank Go=
d). Another is that, while for a normal sad person, getting negative though=
ts out in the open helps expunge them, for depressed people airing the nega=
tive thoughts just forces them to<em>&nbsp;think</em>&nbsp;their negative t=
houghts, without expunging them. Another is that the emotional disconnectio=
n that I mentioned in point 1 tends to short-circuit the warm, good feeling=
 that usually comes from someone being sympathetic and friendly toward you.=
</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin:=

/strong></em><strong>&nbsp;need human company.</strong>&nbsp;For some reaso=
n, human company helps. In fact, it is the single thing that helps the most=
=2E But not the kind of company a sad pe=
rson needs. What a depressed person n=
eeds is simply to talk to people,&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>about their proble=
ms or their negative thoughts or their depression, but about anything else =
- music, animals, science. The most helpful topic of conversation, I've fou=
nd, is absurdity - just talking about utterly ridiculous things, gross thin=
gs, vulgar offensive things, bizarre things. Shared activities, like going =
on a hike or playing sports, are OK, but talking is much, much more importa=
nt. I really have never figured out why this works, but it does.<br><br>And=
 of course, relationships are very, very important. Friends, I think, are t=
he most important, because friends offer opportunity for understanding and =
positive interaction without much feeling of obligation or shame (see point=
 6). Family and lovers are important, but really, the friendship component =
of these relationships has to dominate, so the depressed person doesn't con=
stantly think negative thoughts about how they've let you down. Essentially=
, to help a depressed person, friends need to become a bit more like family=
, and family a bit more like friends. Also, you should realize that just be=
cause your depressed friend or family member is unresponsive, that doesn't =
mean that you aren't doing him or her a lot of good.</p><p style=3D"color: =
#1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">5.&nbsp;<s=
trong>Cognitive behavioral therapy really works.</strong>&nbsp;I've taken o=
ne antidepressant drug (Lexapro), but it did nothing perceptible for me. (T=
his is not to say that antidepressants in general don't work; for that, ask=
 PubMed. This is just about my personal experience.) What has worked for me=
 is cognitive behavioral therapy. The "cognitive part" is the most importan=
t. Basically, depressed people have negative thoughts that they can't get o=
ut of their head; cognitive therapy teaches you to habitually identify, exa=
mine, and correct these negative thoughts. That really helps; once those ne=
gative thoughts aren't always racing unnoticed through the back of your min=
d, your brain has a much easier time repairing the damage done by a depress=
ive episode. Also, "behavioral" therapies can be important for improving yo=
ur lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-he=
ight: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Cognitive behavioral therapy is best done b=
y a counseling therapist, and there are many good therapists, but also many=
 crappy ones. It is easy to see who is good and who is crappy, but since de=
pressed people have low volition, sometimes they need a push to ditch a bad=
 therapist and keep looking for a good one.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; =
font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">6.&nbsp;<strong>Dep=
ressed people may need a new "narrative".</strong>&nbsp;I've also called th=
is a "new perspective", but I think the word "narrative" fits better. I've =
discussed my "narrative theory of depression" at length with psychotherapis=
ts. Keep in mind that this theory of mine might be wrong, and even if it's =
right, it might only be right for a subset of depressed people!</p><p style=
=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;"=
>Basically, I think that the most important repetitive negative thought tha=
t afflicts depressed people is&nbsp;<em>negative self-evaluation</em>. You =
think, in a very detached, dissociated way, "The person who I call 'me' is =
a worthless person." And I think that the main criterion that we use to eva=
luate people is the&nbsp;<em>narrative</em>; a story that seems to unify an=
d make sense of a person's life. Obviously, this is not a realistic or accu=
rate method; human beings are not consistent, we are not simple, and we don=
't make sense. The narratives that we construct for ourselves are mostly bu=
llshit. We construct them out of a need to make sense of the world, not as =
rational scientific theories that best fit the available data.&nbsp;</p><p =
style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1e=
m 0;">I feel like most people construct a narrative of their life that is b=
asically positive. People tend to think that they are good, and also talent=
ed and special, and that their life is progressing toward some purpose. We =
are each the protagonist in our own story. This narrative gives them motiva=
tion, and also the overconfidence they need to take risks and exert effort =
(Ha! I managed to slip in a behavioral econ reference after all!). People a=
lso strive to fit their positive narratives. The part of people that conduc=
ts self-evaluations - the "internal performance review" component of the ps=
yche, if you will - observes how well the person is living up to the positi=
ve narrative, and tries to correct deviations.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1=
a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">But sometimes, f=
or some reason, people become fixated on a negative personal narrative. Ins=
tead of the protagonist or hero of the story of your life, you become the v=
illain, or the tragedic failure. Instead of Luke Skywalker, you become Oedi=
pus. And because we construct our narratives to have false consistency, the=
 negative narrative starts to color absolutely everything you do. You start=
 to see every action you take as backed by bad motives, or as doomed to fai=
lure. You perceive every emotion as base and reprehensible. The "internal p=
erformance review" part of yourself, whose task it usually to keep you toei=
ng the line of the positive narrative, begins to throw up its hands and wis=
h that it could just get rid of you completely.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a=
1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Obviously, this=
 could lead to some very bad things.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-si=
ze: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">I believe that many depres=
sed people are constantly afflicted by the crushing negative feedback of a =
negative personal narrative. And I've found that the biggest single thing t=
hat helps people out of depression is the scrapping of the negative narrati=
ve and its replacement with a positive alternative narrative. This is usual=
ly possible, because narratives are mostly constructed out of bullshit - re=
place the bad bullshit with good bullshit, and you win. But that is&nbsp;<e=
m>much</em>&nbsp;easier said than done.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font=
-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">If you have depressed f=
riends, you can, in theory, help them construct a new, positive narrative f=
or themselves. But this is a very difficult thing to do, because a coherent=
, believable narrative is a rare thing, and you never quite know what will =
stick and what will be rejected. The good news is, if you try and fail, you=
r depressed friend will be no worse off. Remember, depressed people are wea=
k-willed, they have low volition and little initiative; to help your depres=
sed friend construct a new narrative, you have to be pro-active. You've got=
 to spontaneously volunteer positive perspectives on his or her life, witho=
ut being asked to do so.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16=
px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">This goes against our social ins=
tincts, since with a normal, non-depressed sad friend, doing this is kind o=
f a mean thing to do; the friend just needs you to listen and understand, n=
ot to contradict, reinterpret, and dismiss their pain. But a depressed pers=
on is not sad, and what they need is very different from what a non-depress=
ed sad friend needs. I'm not saying you should be an aggressive jerk, and b=
erate your friends for thinking negative thoughts. Nor am I saying you shou=
ld project fake sunny optimism about your friend's life. It takes a lot mor=
e honesty than that, not to mention finesse and creativity and careful gues=
swork about the nature of your friend's "negative narrative". So go slowly =
and carefully.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height:=
 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">As for what&nbsp;<em>kind</em>&nbsp;of positive =
narrative to help your depressed friend construct...well, this will be very=
 different for each person, and it will depend on what kind of&nbsp;<em>neg=
ative</em>&nbsp;narrative they've constructed for themselves. In general, t=
hough, I'd say that it's good to reinterpret past "failures" as necessary s=
teps on the road to future successes. And it's important to emphasize how m=
uch potential the depressed person still has in their future - like in the =
movie City Slickers, when Billy Crystal convinces his depressed friend that=
 he gets to have a "do-over" in life. In general, if you can help a depress=
ed person visualize a different and positive future, he or she will enterta=
in the notion that his or her past "mistakes" might have just been "Act Two=
" in a three-act romance, instead of the final act in a Greek tragedy.</p><=
p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 =
1em 0;">Now, I am not saying that construction of this "new narrative" is a=
 cure for depression. It is a complement to things like cognitive behaviora=
l therapy, constant low-pressure human interaction, a healthy lifestyle, et=
c.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margi=
n: 0 0 1em 0;">7.&nbsp;<strong>Depressed people always need to be vigilant =
against a relapse.</strong>&nbsp;Depression is like cancer - once you have =
it, it remits, possibly forever, but you are never "cured". Relapses are no=
t certain, but the danger will always be there. Therefore, after recovering=
 from a depressive episode, a depressed person must change his or her life =
completely and permanently. The things that you did to get out of depressio=
n, you must&nbsp;<em>never stop doing</em>&nbsp;for the rest of your life. =
You must permanently place a greater emphasis on human contact and on meani=
ngful, positive, healthy relationships of all kinds. You must constantly th=
ink about what makes you happy and how to get it, and you must constantly t=
ake steps toward a positive future that you envision for yourself. If you a=
llow yourself to coast, or get stuck in a rut, you will fall back into the =
pit and have to start all over again. And if therapy helped you, keep going=
 to therapy forever. What's more, if you get out of depression, do lots of =
things to remind you about what got you out of it. Turn it into a story of =
personal triumph, and repeat that story to yourself. And never forget to so=
lidify, cement, embellish, and elaborate a positive narrative of your life.=
</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin:=

 The long version could fill books. Maybe someday it will. In the meantime,=
 remember, depression is real. It's among the worst things that can happen =
to you. But it is beatable.</p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px; line-height: =
