Laura,

We were doing some opportunity analysis and realised that there may be a
potential student project / whitepaper here.

One of the things we see a lot of in existing qualitative measurement
systems is an attempt to use self-assessment to quantify bias. Do you think
your Fellows could determine a way to flow back a peer assessment of bias
from our data?

Let me know if it's worth bringing this into the discussion alongside the
gender paper suggestion in our meeting next week.

All best,
Josh
