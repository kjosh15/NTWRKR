Whatever platform you're using should have an option to sell as a drop
and/or auction, so start there. Beyond that, it should be as simple as
passing a link around where people can put in a credit card and put a hold
on an auction price.

After that it's just marketing - and you know how to do that, I'm sure!
Who/how are you planning to get this in front of people?
