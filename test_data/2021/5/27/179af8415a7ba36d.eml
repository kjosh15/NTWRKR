Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their networks in a =
newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. We've =
been in touch in the past so I wanted to invite you to reconnect to see if =
we could help each other - now more than ever helping lift up good people =
has become a priority!
=20
Below are a few of my current projects; let me =
know if any strike your interest, or just hit me with an update on what =
you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!
=20
All best wishes,
Josh
