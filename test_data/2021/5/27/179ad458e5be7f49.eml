Thanks, Randy. I don't want to waste your time and don't have anything more
strategic to offer other than that we're in an increasingly advantageous
position long term... with the same short-term cash flow challenges. If
there's a family office with a strong interest in our space and a desire to
help us scale quickly towards a sale I'd love to connect, but otherwise
will revisit when I have something new to add!

As ever, if I can return the favor or be helpful in any way please let me
know - thanks for the consideration!

All the best,
Josh
