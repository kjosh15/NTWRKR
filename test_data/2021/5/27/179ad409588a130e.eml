Hey Lynn! Happy to chat, but we're in the middle of pushing through an ISO
certification and are a little underwater. I know it's not in the next few
days, but let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work,
or suggest something that works for you GMT. Alternatively, if you can give
me any updates via email or Signal I'll try to respond more quickly
asynchronously.

Looking forward to it,
Josh
