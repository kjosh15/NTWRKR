How=E2=80=99s this:

=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94-
It=E2=80=99s been a minute! Some of us are in new geographies, but all of u=
s are in
a new place. We wanted to give the original Ella Baker crew a chance to
reconnect and ground their friendships in all the changes of the last year.

So yes, it=E2=80=99s another zoom party, but hopefully one that=E2=80=99s f=
un and
worthwhile! Let us know if your kid can connect with us at:

9am PST
Noon EST
4pm GMT

On May X, 2021. If you=E2=80=99re available we=E2=80=99ll send an invite! W=
e=E2=80=99ll have a game
they can play if they choose, but otherwise the only ask is that everyone
have a something unique about where they live to share.

Looking forward to seeing all those smiling faces again,
Othinn (and Josh and Hulda)

=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94-

Xoxo,
Josh
