I cannot find my original email on this topic anywhere!! Here's what I'm
thinking now:

# Othinn:
1 section Khan Academy
1 page report (on any topic he likes)

# Haakon:
1 Epic book
20m Khan Academy on phone

Then they can together do 20m of Education Edition Minecraft and 20m smart
games on phone.

That adds up to about an hour on devices a day, which isn't ideal, but it
does cover some pretty important basics.

Do you have any alternative ideas for the 1 page report for Othinn (which I
think would be a hard sell)? Also, what was the math game Othinn played so
much - think that could be good for Haakon?

Would really like to get this together to discuss with the boys before the
end of the school year.

xoxo,
Josh
