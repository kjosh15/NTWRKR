Ken,

*TL;DR: We are building out our advisory board and I was curious if you'd
be interested in learning more.*

Many years ago now I gave a presentation on innovation and technology to
yourself and your executive team. It proved to be transformational for me
as I walked away from it realizing that for all my knowledge of tech, I
wasn't focusing on the people in the organizations I was consulting to
*first*, and that they were key.

Since that time I've developed a platform <http://www.indigometrics.com>
that creates reliable metrics on employee *behaviors* (not feelings), as
well as a means to automatically improve alignment around core corporate
values. Again, this came directly from our conversation that day.

Over the course of the last year we're gotten a huge amount of interest in
using our platform for Inclusion and Diversity. We're developing an HBR
article with one of larger clients (55k employees) who've used it for this
purpose, Wharton's People Analytics team is doing a whitepaper, and we're
facing a pipeline which at last count had 14 large multinational clients.

Given your recent announcement about retirement I recognize this is surely
a busy time, but it may also be a time of transition in which you're
looking for something new and interesting to explore. I'm hopeful we may be
one of those things.

Let me know if you're available for a quick call to learn more!

Sincerely,
Josh
