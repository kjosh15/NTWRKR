Geir,

Thank you for your kind assistance in this matter. In reviewing the referenc=
es you forwarded to us we have, a- learned we cannot pre-register until 72 h=
ours prior to departure and, b- cannot see part 2 of the pre-registration fo=
rm (so that we might be sure to have needed information at hand). Further, i=
n our review of the materials and references you have provided, we cannot fi=
nd how we request/reserve a quarantine hotel for Mrs. Klein and myself, whic=
h we understand can/will be provided for us.=20

To summarize, we have learned from our family members in Iceland that, =E2=80=
=9CYou can get a free night at a quarantine hotel=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D (per our=
 son, Joshua Klein in conversation with his father-in-law, Emil Bj=C3=B6rnss=
on).  =E2=80=9CCall =E2=80=A6 an Icelandic consulate =E2=80=A6 +1 on calling=
. Regulations are changing, and they=E2=80=99ll put you up in a free hotel, b=
ut it=E2=80=99s not clear how.=E2=80=9D

As you are likely aware, we arrive early (6:10 AM on Icelandair=E2=80=99s BO=
S-KEF flight) and, after our Covid test we pick up our rental car and would -=
 very much - like to know where we are supposed to go to wait the up-to 24 h=
ours for test results.=20

To clarify our further plans, from the Reykjavik area we plan to head to our=
 family about 20 minutes north of Akureryi (Joshua Klein and family; Vidifel=
l, 607 Akureyri; 354-655-3925 or Hulda Emilsdottir; 354-821-4329). We plan o=
n traveling through the West Fjords on our way there, taking a couple of day=
s en route.

We look forward your clarification of this matter and will anxiously await y=
our response.=20

Thank you, again, for your assistance in this matter.=20
