Great chatting with you as well!! I really appreciated your perspective -
and it was so good to talk with someone who gets large corporate BS as its
own class of problem...

We've got plenty of system engineering challenges here, but fortunately
calendering isn't one of them (yet). I've got it on mine to reach out again
in a month or so, but please feel free to pre-empt me especially if things
change on your end. When do you anticipate wrapping up the Google Data
Analyst course?
