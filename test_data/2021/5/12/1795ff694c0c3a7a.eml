Elana,

Thanks so much for your very thoughtful comments on the W50 session
yesterday (I'm a special advisor to W50, focusing on technology). I
followed with interest your remarks around metricing, specifically in terms
of employee behavior and ESG/I&D initiatives. Do you have time for a
short call regarding?

Sincerely,
Josh
