Hello,
I have bad news. In our town for this week enter restrictions due to
covid-19 and so, holding a conference in May canceled. Now a conference is
planed in September, but I don't have an accurate date, when I know the
date, i will inform. Hopefully, you can join with us in September by online
video. Thank you very much for you support.

electronics, which could be useful for people. Contact with such project as=
 yours, give an inspiration for guys like me to create and invent new proje=
cts. Honestly, we want to invite you to Zoom or Skype, to discuss the idea =
of interaction between crows and people with you.<br>In May there will be a=
 conference of makers in my town. The idea of this conference is smart and =
clean city. If we could contact you by Zoom or Skype during this conference=
 that would be delightfully. You could realize the idea with crows in life,=
 in my opinion it=E2=80=99s very difficult world-class project, I think, yo=
u will produce a big effect for each conference participant. So, I would li=
ke to suggest you to join us this forum in May 14 after noon for 10-15 minu=
tes, to communicate and talk with my friends about your project, we will be=
 very grateful, if you find a time for us.<br></div><br><div class=3D"gmail=
