Excellent points, Grace. If you're game, I'd love to set a time to dig in a
little more - given that we've been both educating and identifying product
fit for 6+ years it's hard to get clarity on what problem it is that we're
solving, esp. b/c the problem is often different in type (but identical in
means). I.e., Company X may have a culture problem with apathy, and Company
Z has a culture problem with aggression, but they both have culture
problems. That's not yet well understood as a metricable and functionally
addressable problem.

Would be delighted to talk to Michael Kantor, thanks!! Always glad to chat
with new folks.

If Jeffrey's interested, we'd love to talk to him. We're starting to
specialize in companies that have toxic internal problems as our tool is a)
highly effective, b) built on real data (not politics, sentiment, or
theories), and c) longitudinal (and thereby evolutionary). Thank you so
much for being willing to check with him!!

How's LA?? Curious about your globe travelling, future plans, and world
changing efforts. Let me know if you're around in the next couple weeks for
a chat!

P.S. I LOVE this <https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game>
article. Posits that the Internet gamifies life with much more
effective/inclusive/accellerated parameters, and that crypto is bolstering
that. FWIW. :)
