Hey Scott! Haven't heard from you in quite some time; I wanted to check in,
firstly just to make sure you're alive and well, and secondly to ask if
you'd mind if I took you off my Personal Advisory Board list. I'm trying to
keep it quite small, and (assuming all is well!) you're clearly full-on
with other projects.

Let me know if you mind, and otherwise I hope to get the chance to
collaborate with you again in future!!

All best wishes,
Josh
