Hulda reminded me that I'm notoriously bad about notifying family (or
anyone, really) when I do something public facing, and so for the last
couple weeks we've had a bunch of friends calling, texting, and emailing to
say "Hey, did I hear Josh on [whatever podcast they heard it advertised
on]?"

So, apologies for not letting you know earlier: I cohost a podcast for
Accenture, they're advertising it heavily via the NY Times and their
related properties, and you can listen to it here
<https://accntu.re/3ttSJek> if you'd like an earful of large corporate
business strategy.

Love you all,
Josh
