Hey Adam! Had a good couple conversations with Jennifer about the podcast -
in the meantime wanted to follow up with a link to the podcast
<https://accntu.re/3ttSJek> I cohosted with Gilded as producers for
Accenture (in conjunction w/ the NY Times). If nothing else it's a pretty
good reference point for higher-end content. I'd be curious what you
thought!

All best,
Josh
