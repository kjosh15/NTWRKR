OK, J=C3=B6rg, here's the story:

A friend (the one who helped me get my Icelandic citizenship) got breast
cancer. When she was starting her treatment she was in a record store and
decided to ask about the music they were playing in the background. As she
approached the desk, someone ahead of her asked the older gentleman at the
desk, who explained that he'd been diagnosed with cancer and discovered the
music while in Norway, and listened to it throughout his entire treatment
and was now cancer free. She did the same thing, and is now cancer free.

All of which is to say, it's pretty good music!
