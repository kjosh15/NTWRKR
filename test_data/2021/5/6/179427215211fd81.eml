Are you going to be near a used electronics shop where you could pick up a
cheap USB keyboard? I'm realizing I'm spending a huge amount of time typing
during meetings with my laptop on a stand, and it's killing my wrists.
Don't want to spend on a new keyboard (plus shipping) - if one is handy can
you throw it in your bag?

xoxo,
Josh
