Good points. That said, "a self- organizing system geared to optimize
around those metrics" is exactly what DAO's are supposed to be - the
suposedly-ultimate promise of blockchain smart contracts. I agree with you
that the human element makes that exceedingly unlikely as it's the most
dynamic and disruptive factor... as well as the one that distinguishes us
from the ants.

That's getting much closer to where I see some far-off real potential for
Indigometrics; if we can provide statistical representation of behavior in
a way that supports and allows for emergent *new* behavior and values, is
that a strong enough (and adaptive enough) metric to coordinate
human participants with a DAO-like set of contracts?

Note that the above is separate from ESG: as much as ESG is driving a lot
of activity right now I think you're right that it's a subset of required
corporate behaviors. I'm still curious about it as a potentially efficient
entrant for a behavior metricing platform, however!
