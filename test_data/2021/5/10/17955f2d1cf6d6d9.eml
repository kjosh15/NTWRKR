eresting. Recently I put the device back in the city, and I am waiting for =
the crows to come again. What is your lot?<br><br>I recently came across an=
other person who teaches corvids. You may have heard of him, this is Hans F=
orsberg (<a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBg=
A" rel=3D"noreferrer noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.youtube.com/=
channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA</a>). He managed to train forty to assembl=
e metal lids. And I think he also wants to start collecting cigarette butts=
. Have you seen him?<br><br>If you&#39;re interested, here&#39;s my neural =
network video - <a href=3D"https://fb.watch/4N1Uptgr84/" rel=3D"noreferrer =
