Mattias,

You introduced me to Sean Glass way back in 2009, but now seems the right
time to reconnect: you've just launched Moonfire and I have a startup based
in Iceland/UK/Barcelona that's creating the Google Analytics for corporate
culture.

We have 21 customers (including 3 large multinationals) with 4 more large
multinationals in discussion. We're about to publish an HBR article case
study and a Wharton Whitepaper, and are looking at raising a seed round to
accelerate growth.

I've attached our overview deck, and our site <http://www.indigometrics.com=
>
has a brief overview video. Let me know if it's worth reconnecting!

All best,
Josh
