John,

We had lunch in 2009 in NYC. Afterwards, you wrote:

"It was my pleasure! Until beer! That is all."

And then it was, until now. Because I have co-developed a tv series using
GPT-3 (Microsoft's enormous AI chat engine, or "language model") to allow
the citizens of the United States to talk to themselves through technology.

But we need an EP (and host) who can give voice to the Internet. And that
person should be you.

Let me know if you're interested; I'd be lovely to catch up regardless and
see how the wringer of COVID-19 has compressed time and space for you.
Also, I'm in Iceland now, if you'd like to come for that beer.

All best,
Josh <http://www.josh.is>

P.S. Treatment attached.
