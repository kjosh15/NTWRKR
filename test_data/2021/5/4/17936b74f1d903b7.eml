Simon,

Long time no speak! No lambs here, but the foals are racing back and forth
across the field outside as I speak.

Came across this <https://etherisc.com/files/etherisc_onepager_1.0_en.pdf>
and thought of you.

I've a friend getting involved. Nothing new other than the (surprisingly
quick) growth of my culture metric company <http://www.indigometrics.com>;
life here in Iceland is pretty stellar in terms of time with kids,
especially in the pandemic. I hope you're doing as well or better - hit me
with an update when you get a chance!

All best wishes,
Josh
