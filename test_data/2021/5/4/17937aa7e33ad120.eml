Kes,

Pleasure chatting with you earlier - I've just sent my wife the
artofproblemsolving.com and brilliant.org links!

Pursuant KPMG, please find attached our overview deck. A short video is
available on our site <http://www.indigometrics.com>, and you can kick the
tires in our sandbox here:

http://reviews.indigometrics.com/

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$


Please let me know if this looks like the kind of thing KPMG can use today,
and if so let's set up another call to talk about how it's extensible and
integratable.

Looking forward to it,
Josh

connect to see if we could help each other in the future.</p>=20

any strike your interest, or just hit me with an update on what you're work=
ing on. Or let's set up a time to chat!</p>=20
