Malika,

Long time no speak! The platform I've been working on for the last couple
years exploded over COVID-19, and we're now building a group of large
companies tackling the I&D challenge.

This is specifically pertinent to Constellation as you've already got a
number of solid programs around Inclusion and Diversity in place.
Unfortunately, what we're seeing is that with all the noise around I&D
right now that's not enough to differentiate.

Indigometrics is providing actual numbers on literal behaviors within
organizations, which is an absolute stand-out differentiator. Our largest
customer (55k employees) is working on an HBR article about using our
platform in their I&D transformation for exactly this reason.

We're currently working with three and are in discussion with four more
US-based large multinationals on this project. Is it worth a short call to
catch up?

All best,
Josh
