Any footnotes that could help me scope this? I have a few clients that are
interested in the space but don't want to jump into something if Kehinde is
going to come back shortly - I'm also giving a talk next week to a bunch of
executives that are looking for something to buy, which might be a fun
group to intro.

Let me know if you have any insights, and otherwise I hope you're doing
well - the US looks like it's opening up nicely!! How's it feel?

All best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

Thank you for sending over these materials and for checking back in. We
have been delayed with the creation of the artwork and are in the process
of re-organizing our timelines and plans.

As soon as we have more concrete plans and ideas in place again I will be
back in touch with you to see if it might still make sense to work together=
.

I really appreciate your time and interest in this project.

Best wishes, and until soon,
Rosey
