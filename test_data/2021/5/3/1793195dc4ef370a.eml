Sweets,

This
<https://www.bicycling.com/news/a36063815/minimum-amount-of-exercise-to-sta=
y-fit-study/>
is an article I thought was really informative about keeping in good shape:

- According to new research, you can reduce your training volume by a third
and still maintain your endurance fitness for up to 15 weeks.

- You can maintain your VO2 max with just two sessions a week, so long as
your overall volume and intensity remains the same.

- Additionally, you can keep your muscles strong with just one session of
strength training per week and one set per exercise, as long as you=E2=80=
=99re
lifting at least as much weight as you typically do.

I.e., if we train hard every other quarter (run 3x/week + strength
training) we can reduce it to a couple runs and a couple short strength
workouts per week for a quarter. Would be curious what you thought from
this!

xoxo,
Josh
