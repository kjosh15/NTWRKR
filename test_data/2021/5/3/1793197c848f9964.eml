Sounds good. For better or worse I've spent a lot of my anonymity, so I'll
see if it's something I can help with on a low-commitment basis.

Curious what might change on your thinking around privacy and anonymity. My

career has taken me in the opposite direction) - what might change?

All best,
Josh
