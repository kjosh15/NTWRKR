Morgan,

Thanks for the interest! Here's the credentials for our sandbox so you can
take a look:

http://reviews.indigometrics.com/

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$


Note that the above link has all the bells and whistles turned on so it's a
bit more crowded than an actual deployment.

In terms of soundbites, here's the top points that come to mind:

Customers: We have 21 customers currently, including 3 Large
multinationals, from a variety of verticals (everything from construction
to publishing to rugby). Additionally, we have:
- 4 large multinationals in discussion
- 10 large multinationals in the pipeline

Right now we're profitable enough to cover all costs + salaries for three
employees. (My cofounder and I are still running w/out salary).

Under current contracts we should clear ~$.5mm this year, $1mm next year,
and $2mm the year after that - assuming no further business.

We're working on an HBR article with our largest client around how we
powered their I&D effort.

We're working with Wharton's People Analytics team on a whitepaper and
accompanying HBR article on the efficacy of the platform.

We're seeing $1-1.5mm in seed funding to exploit the gap we're in now to
make infrastructure improvements and customer onboarding processes to
support what we see as incipient radical growth. We may have a lead
investor here in Iceland, but would love to talk to anyone you think is
aligned with our purpose of changing the world of work for the better!

Very much obliged,
Josh
