emember? Sorry for not writing for a long time, I was very busy with the pr=
oject.<br>While I went back to the city to study, the birds went through th=
e second stage of training, they took peanuts from the device. Thanks, your=
 advice helped.<br><br>Now I&#39;m working on a neural network, I already h=
ave a network that detects butts and opens the device, but this is only a d=
emo version. I also began to make a model of my own device for training on =
cigarette butts. This is really very interesting. Recently I put the device=
 back in the city, and I am waiting for the crows to come again. What is yo=
ur lot?<br><br>I recently came across another person who teaches corvids. Y=
ou may have heard of him, this is Hans Forsberg (<a href=3D"https://www.you=
tube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA" target=3D"_blank" rel=3D"norefer=
rer">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtkv3wuEP-Veur4iYJWkBgA</a>). He mana=
ged to train forty to assemble metal lids. And I think he also wants to sta=
rt collecting cigarette butts. Have you seen him?<br><br>If you&#39;re inte=
rested, here&#39;s my neural network video - <a href=3D"https://fb.watch/4N=
1Uptgr84/" target=3D"_blank" rel=3D"noreferrer">https://fb.watch/4N1Uptgr84=
/</a>. It is in Russian, but part of the video on the neural network can be=
 understood without words)<br><br>Seen your latest YouTube videos, it&#39;s=
 great.<br><br>Respectfully yours, Rodion.<br></div>
