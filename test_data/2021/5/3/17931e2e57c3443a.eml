<br>
Great chatting with you last Friday, as always! I wanted to follow up on th=
e Indigometrics opportunity.
<br>
<br>
As mentioned, we&#39;re currently working with Wharton&#39;s People Analyti=
cs team on a number of fronts. First, they&#39;ve asked to publish a white =
paper on our culture analytics as they see it as outstanding in the field. =
Secondly, we are exploring using our platform
 to validate their Coachability studies due to our ability to flexibly meas=
ure behavior change over time. Thirdly, we are discussing working with one =
of their leading D&amp;I professors on a collaboration to use data to provi=
de measurement and accountability.<br>
<br>
We&#39;d love to do a D&amp;I pilot with you as I know you&#39;re doing a l=
ot of work in this area. Based on our conversation, there&#39;s a lot of ov=
erlap! I&#39;ve attached a two-pager highlighting where I see the greatest =
potential, along with an overview deck. A short video
