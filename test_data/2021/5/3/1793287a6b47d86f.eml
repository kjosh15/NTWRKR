Hi Josh,

Thank you for sending over these materials and for checking back in. We
have been delayed with the creation of the artwork and are in the process
of re-organizing our timelines and plans.

As soon as we have more concrete plans and ideas in place again I will be
back in touch with you to see if it might still make sense to work together=
.

I really appreciate your time and interest in this project.

Best wishes, and until soon,
Rosey
