 and everything. ;) Glad to hear he&#39;s still doing great work; Blackrock=
 sounds amazing.<br><br>If he&#39;d like to connect his timing is good. I&#=
39;ve been working with a friend who is currently doing a bunch of crypto f=
or the Winklevoss twins and we&#39;d been predicting NFTs for a while - we =
realized we were on the right track when he had to rescue a friend of their=

 I can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell =
via personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It&#39;s very much the wild=

es) do!<br><br>Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else =
I can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans=
