Joshua,

Checked in to the HI Hostel in Laugurvatn.  Which, interestingly, is about 8=
00 meters from the Bjork that we were going to stay at. This is a nice place=
 with new owners; a young couple. He is here alone today and he is going to f=
ix us some lamb for dinner. I asked him to join us and he will.  I am sure w=
e will be able to learn a bit about what we should be looking for/at tomorro=
w and Friday.=20

BTW, the WiFi here in our room is 19/5 with a 13ms ping. For us this is nice=
. Perhaps we can Skype later? Ping us if interested. Dinner is at 6:00, so j=
udge accordingly.

Love,
DAD
