I loved this!! Not least b/c the view on ESG was super encouraging for
Indigometrics... ;) You managed the conversation extremely well. The only
criticism I could come up with was that you had a little echo, which a
better mic may have helped. Not that you asked - I hope it's helpful!!

Overall you came across as extremely insightful, confident, and
knowledgeable. Very nicely done - and very well managed on your part in
crafting the conversation!!

Many congrats,
- J
