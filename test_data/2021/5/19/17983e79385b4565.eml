Josh,

Your Starfield SSL certificate for h4xindustries.com will renew on May 27, 2021. Follow the steps below so you can continue protecting your site--and vistors--with powerful authentication and encryption.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

There are a few things you need to do regarding your SSL certificate renewal.

1. Validate domain ownership for your certificate, if required.

In the unlikely case your certificate is flagged by Starfield for additional validation, you'll receive an email from Starfield with further instructions. Please respond promptly so that your service is not interrupted. 

2. Check Account Center for your new certificate.

You will receive an email from Starfield when your new SSL certificate is issued. Your new certificate should be issued about five days before your current certificate expires, so that you have time to install it.

3. Install your certificate.

Once approved and renenwed, the certificate will be available to install via Account Center.

If you would like more information about renewing an SSL certificate, please visit this step by step instruction guid in our Knowledge Base article: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204645090/
Thanks again for choosing Media Temple.

Best Regards,
Media Temple


Disclaimer: Starting September 1, 2020 browsers will no longer trust SSLs with validity periods longer than 398 days. As such, if you purchase an SSL certificate that is longer than one (1), upon that anniversary you will be required to re-validate and re-install your certificate.
