   Harris,
   <br>
   <br>Thanks for the call on Wednesday; it was good to hear more about you=
r take on the state of global business and the (potentially missed) impact =
of tech!
   <br>
   <br>As requested I&#39;m attaching the overview deck for Indigometrics (=
my culture metrics SaaS company), but encourage you to check out our sandbo=
x as well to get a better handle on the data it generates:

   <br>We&#39;re looking to work with large multinationals who are eager to=
 put data to their culture. If you know anyone that might be a good fit I&#=
39;d very much appreciate the connection.
   <br>
   <br>Along those same lines, you&#39;d recommended we talk to Towers Pare=
n (now Willis Towers Watson): I really like the idea partnering with larger=
 HR+Data companies that may have a greater need for a technical advantage, =
but don&#39;t understand how to qualify multi-service platform organization=
s like this. Insurance (where Willis Towers Watson seems to sit now) is too=
 broad, and players I&#39;ve spoken to (like Marsh) are miles away from und=
erstanding the value.=20
   <br>
   <br>It may be I&#39;m missing the forest for the trees here. Do you have=
 a view on how best to attack this?=20
   <br>
   <br>All best,
