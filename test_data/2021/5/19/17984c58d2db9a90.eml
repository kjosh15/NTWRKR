Karl, Arnar,

Thanks again for the call earlier today; it was very useful to understand
what you've got on your plate and I'm excited to take a few steps forward.

If you could introduce us to the group in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur looking=
 at sustainable
transport as well as the group in the south looking at greenhouses I'd like
to get those conversations started.

Separately, please send the english piece on tax incentives for
Environmental investment so I can get up to date prior to my pending
conversations with potential real estate interests.

Finally, I'll check out Dav=C3=AD=C3=B0 Helgason's fund and will circle bac=
k on
Sidekick Health about my CGM project once I've vetted Sutter Health's
interest.

Best of luck in mapping problem areas to improve for foreign investors, and
looking forward to seeing what we can do together.

Very much obliged,
Josh
