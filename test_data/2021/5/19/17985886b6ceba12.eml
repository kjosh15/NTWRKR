Marla,

I've been meaning to loop around to you for a while; entirely separately
from W50 I've been working on a platform <http://www.indigometrics.com>
which uses peer-to-peer evaluation to quantify employee behavior, and we've
seen a ton of growth in interest around leadership development over the
last 6 months. Are you available for a quick call to share perspectives on
where/how a tool like this might be useful? Part of the impetus is that
we've recently been approached by KPMG and I'm curious to hear what the
McKinsey view might be!

All best wishes,
Josh
