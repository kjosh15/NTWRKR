Long time no speak! Is there any chance you're available for a brief call
on L&D? Indigometrics has a whitelabeled reseller in the UK which is
producing clients like crazy and we'd like to approach the US market - but
I have no idea how to qualify a good potential partner. If you've got any
advice or time to discuss I'd be hugely grateful: if nothing else I can
promise you some interesting insights into the state of analytics and human
capital!

And no, I've not moved to Berlin... yet.

Very much obliged,
Josh
