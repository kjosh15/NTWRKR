Derek,

Long time no speak! I hope you're doing well in light of the massive
changes brought on by the past year.

In line with said changes, is there any chance you're available for a brief
call reg. L&D? Indigometrics <http://www.indigometrics.com> (my culture
metrics company) has been trialing a whitelabeled reseller in the UK which
is producing clients like crazy and we'd like to approach the US market -
but I have no idea how to qualify a good potential partner and could use
some sound advice.

If you've got any advice or time to discuss I'd be hugely grateful: if
nothing else I can promise you some interesting insights into the state of
analytics + human capital!

Very much obliged,
Josh
