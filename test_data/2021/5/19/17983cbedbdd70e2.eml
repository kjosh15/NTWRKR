Good to hear from you!

Indigometrics could definitely inform tools like goethena.com - do you know
anyone there?

Curious to hear more about forensic data analytics tools for blockchains,
esp. as I've been doing a bit of consulting around fintech/NFTs.

Let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or suggest
something that works for you GMT. Looking forward to it!

All best,
Josh
