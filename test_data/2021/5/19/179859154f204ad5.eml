That=E2=80=99s a blessing Josh! Thank you! Also got an opportunity to =
listen to the podcast! I=E2=80=99m so grateful to have been a part of =
it. Loved how you all spoke on the research report and my story to =
highlight the findings.

I was curious, with IndigoMetrics do you already have a framework =
you=E2=80=99re using with firms in an engineering / product context? =
There could be a lot of synergy in our work if for example we could =
partner on using a tool like yours to help companies and orgs gather the =
insights allowing them to identify their present gaps in culture and =
leverage our network/programming to support change via education and =
leadership development. Perhaps you=E2=80=99ve already thought of =
something like this, in which case I=E2=80=99d love to be more involved =
however possible!

Just a thought,
