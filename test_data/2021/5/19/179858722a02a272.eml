Hey Phillip, thanks again for the invite to the Clubhouse event - it was
loads of fun and I'm curious to see where the associated NFT idea goes!!

Entirely separately, April and Jennifer at W50 asked me to loop back in a
couple weeks on the podcast idea because of internal "stuff." Let me know
if this is outside your remit (or if I should just cut it out and be
patient!), but do you recommend cooling my jets or pushing my luck w/ Adam
and Michael to try to generate more momentum internally? Your advice to
pitch it as a test was spot on!!

The reason I'm antsy is that appetite around podcasts is picking up speed
again and I don't want to lose my partners / availability. Microsoft is
trying to get me on as a platform host, and TBH I'd rather spend the time
working with W50.

Hope you're well - drop me an update sometime and/or let me know how/if I
can help otherwise!!

Gratefully,
Josh
