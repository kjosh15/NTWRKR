Nitin,

Excellent speaking with you Friday; it was a pleasure to hear about your
marketing challenges, especially in light of the pandemic! It was also
encouraging to hear about the positive impact of giving employees an
opportunity to speak about D&I.

I'll keep an ear out for potential partners and opportunities going
forward; in the meantime, keep me posted if I can be of any other help!

All best,
Josh
