Dear Friends and Family,



We hope that all finds you well.  It has been quite a busy time for Eric
and I this past month!  We are independently and collectively moving
through Irish bureaucracies, taking full advantage of our new freedoms and
even starting to learn the Irish language.  The weather has been amazing,
we have had lots of rainbows and currently it is in the low 70=E2=80=99s an=
d sunny=F0=9F=98=8A.
Also, tomorrow, we both receive our first vaccine shot! And most
importantly, we are only one week away from the pubs opening (outdoors)!!!!





Bureaucracy - The great job creator

We are so close on finally closing on our house, so close.  We have signed
paperwork, all of the bank requirements have been sorted, we have taken
measurements and have our purchasing plan in place for new beds and a
washing machine but alas there is one more snag.  It seems as though the
boundary map currently filed with the county is off by a foot or two and
needs to be fixed before we can sign the deeds.  This requires our
solicitor (lawyer) to work with the neighbor=E2=80=99s solicitor and the so=
licitor
representing the sister, brother and sister-in-law of the previous owner to
sign some papers so that the map can be officially redrawn.  Everything is
amicable it is just a time-consuming proccess and we are very hopeful that
it will reach its conclusion shortly.

I have also been working with the Teaching Counsel here to get certified.
After submitting all of my paperwork and receiving a letter saying, =E2=80=
=98Don=E2=80=99t
call us, we=E2=80=99ll call you=E2=80=99 in November, I contacted them only=
 to find out
that there were a couple of things they were still needing from me before
they could process my file.  You know, things that I should have
independently known about like a copy of my marriage certificate, pictures
of my actual diplomas and an e-mail from my reference confirming that they
were indeed my reference.  Hopefully, that has now all been sorted.  I am
already eligible to substitute teach next year, which is what I want to do,
as I have proven myself to be safe around the children, I just wouldn=E2=80=
=99t get
paid enough for it to make it worth it without the official credentials.



Freedom!

We have been exploring Dublin County and beyond on our weekends, it is
wonderful to visit places outside of our 5km radius.  From Portmanock
Beach, which is on the north side of Dublin, we walked along the coast to
Malahide and ate lunch at the castle there.  We hiked to the Hellfire Club
in the Dublin Mountains, the Hellfire Club is an old hunting lodge that is
said to be one of the most haunted places in Ireland but did not run into
any ghosts.  We hiked up to Mount Scarr in the Wicklow Mountains and
enjoyed amazing views.  We revisited Howth and did the Frogs to Bogs loop
rewarding ourselves with Beshoff=E2=80=99s fish and chips at the end, which=
 are
quite possibly the most delicious fish and chips in the world! We did a
loop from Monkstown to the top of Kilkenny Hill and back through Dalkey and
Dun Laoghaire.  This is a great walk that starts not too far from our
current home. We used the Alltrails App for the walk and it was like a
self-guided tour. Fun fact:  There was a train that ran from Dalkey to Dun
Laoghaire that was vacuum powered called the Atmospheric Railway. It used a
15 inch pipe and reached speeds of 40 mph.  It was the longest vacuum train
in operation but had to be discontinued because rats kept breaking the
seals by eating the rubber.  We did a loop from Donabate Beach to Portrane
through the Rogerstown Estuary.  We went to Newgrange, and were the only
ones there! Quartz stones were quarried over 5,000 years ago for the fa=C3=
=A7ade
of the burial mound in Wicklow and taken over 40 miles to Newgrange.  The
effect during the winter solstice is that the front glows amber at
sunrise.  And we even managed to visit the Modern Art Museum this past
Friday!



A New Ride

I got a new bike!  It is a beautiful blue gravel bike perfect for the
Greenways around Ireland.  We did a quick test ride to Cabinteely.  It was
a little harder up the hills, it is heavier than my last bike and has
knobby tires but I felt so much more stable on the downhill.  We have
already planned a bike trip to celebrate our 20th anniversary from Westport
to Achill Island on the Great Western Greenway.  More pictures coming!





Bragging Rights

We are so very proud of our Daughter-In-Law, Hannah, who just graduated
from Willamette University with a law degree!  We couldn=E2=80=99t make the
ceremony but got to watch it live which was great, we especially enjoyed
the hooding ceremony which had each student receive their hood from a
friend or family member.  We are also proud of Hannah and Pierce who are in
the process of purchasing their first house in Virginia, as Hannah will be
working for the Environmental Sector of the DOJ starting in September.  And
last but not least, we are proud of Pierce for making a song with his
friends that has gone viral in some military circles.  It is called, Clean
Your 7 Ton and is a parody of Clean Your Room.  If you click on the link
below, the picture you see features Pierce=E2=80=99s backside as he attempt=
s to
apparently sweep the grill of the 7 ton.  Be warned though, if you have
sensitive ears, there are some expletives as it was written and performed
by Marines.  Pierce also does the guitar for the song.
