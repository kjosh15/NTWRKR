Thanks for this; sounds like they're not looking to expand/experiment
elsewhere (at least not yet.)

My brother in law runs most of the geothermal power for the north half of
the country, so definitely have a lead in there, but haven't spoken to Vaxa
or Aldin yet - my concern is that they'll have the same problems most
home-grown Icelandic companies do (i.e., lack of scale, funding, and
vision) but we'll find out. Thanks!!
