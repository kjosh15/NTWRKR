Missed you yesterday; let me know if you'd like to connect sometime this
week.

We're not going to make it to the class, but will be living in an RV for
the summer and would love to come up and spend some time with Harry and the
family. Let us know when you know the timing and if you think we can
connect!

Separately, we've been doing some work with Business Iceland and are due to
talk to Pl=C3=A1mi soon, so we may have business in that part of the world =
soon.
I'd be curious to hear your take.

Hope you're all well,
Josh
