Excellent speaking yesterday - it was fun exchanging notes with someone
who's had a similar front row seat for big tech changes.

If possible, I'd love to talk to both Zach Porter and/or Square Roots about
the potential for Iceland to be a testbed / market leader for vertical
farming. As mentioned, the government is very keen to encourage foreign
investment and market leading development here, and we've already got cheap
electricity and water along with a price insensitive populace who tend to
be fast adopters. It's a small market, but a pretty ideal one for proving
out initiatives like this.

Let me know if I can provide any further info, and let me know if I can
ever return the favor! As mentioned, it was fun to connect - let's do it
again sometime!

All best,
Josh

He's back from Iceland, and I thought it might be meaningful for you two to
connect.
