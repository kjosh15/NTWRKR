Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple!

That is correct, as per the date listed in the email the certificate is not set to renew until tomorrow. Once it has been completely properly renewed, then you will be able to install it from within your Account Center:

https://ac.mediatemple.net/services/manage/index.mt?domain=h4xindustries.com&server=1833654

You have the multi-domain SSL certificate which covers all 3 at the cheapest since our normal SSLs are $75/domain and the SSLs can be installed on any of our services except the new Managed WordPress service.

Please keep in mind that while we may try to assist, troubleshooting the configuration/functionality of third-party applications, code, or scripts, is not covered by our statement of support. For more information on our statement of support, please see the following:
