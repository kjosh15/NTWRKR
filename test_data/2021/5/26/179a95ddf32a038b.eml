Great speaking with you as well.  Always a pleasure meeting someone doing
good work and leading an interesting life.  I'll reach out to both Zack and
the guys at Square Roots.  I do think both will be interested in speaking
with you as it does sound like potentially an excellent opportunity from
both an ROI and a "do good" perspective.
