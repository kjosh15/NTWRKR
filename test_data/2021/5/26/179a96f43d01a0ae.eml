Do you have any advice on pricing out a potential hosting gig for
Microsoft? They have prerecorded segments that they want a live host to
comment on for a live online streaming event. Kind of a new form of TV.

I could ask CAA to rep me, but for a one-off that seems really expensive. I
have NO IDEA how to price this. Do you have any tips?

The appearance fee would be in two scenarios:

1. Travel to/from Redmond, WA. Rehearse and shoot live on same day,
participating in 3 or 4x 2-3minute (ish) segments would be my initial guess=
.

2. Appear live from your own location. Tech check and rehearsal prior, for
3 or 4x 2-3minute (ish) segments.

Any advice is appreciated!

All best from sunny Iceland,
Josh
