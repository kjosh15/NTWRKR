can have a follow-up call next week.

If we're looking to scale the company quickly and sell to a partner who =
can afford us access to a large customer base of data (to allow us to =
focus on feature development) it sounds as though we'd want to find a =
single family office who was interested in our area of emphasis: =
algorithmically measuring and managing behaviors within organizations.

To that end, I've attached our recent pitch deck and would suggest that =
our website's short video <http://www.indigometrics.com/> is probably =
the best introduction. We see ourselves as "The Google Analytics of =
Culture" and given the changes COVID has wrought are looking to scale =
fast and create a new market category.=20

Let me know if you think it's worth a follow-up call, and as ever please =
do let me know how I can be of help in return!

Very much obliged,
Josh
