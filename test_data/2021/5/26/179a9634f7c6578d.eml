Just spoke to Chris Waugh at Sutter Health - he and I have known each other
a while and he recently asked if I knew anything about CGMs.

He's super excited about the idea my deck outlined but needs to figure out
the business model. They have a population to test on, a team of devs to
help with it, studies and Dr's to back it up, etc. as well as excellent
access to Silicon Valley and potential funders (both corporate and angel).

I told him I don't care who's name is on the tin as long as we get results
and can create impact, and that I have a team who can execute the entire
thing soup to nuts.

He's going to loop around with his team and see what they can come up with,
but we're both convinced that this needs to be healthcare provider driven
instead of consumer driven because of incentives - i.e., a small VC-backed
firm wants users to keep using, not individuals to get healthy. (To be
mercenary about it.)

Are you interested in getting involved to see how we can collaborate with
Sutter to get some $$ behind this? I've got a great story and can tell it
to an audience, but I don't have time to drive the project.
