Florian,

Thanks for the call earlier; it was extremely exciting to hear about the
momentum in innovation you're charting at Cargill!! I made a note to keep
an eye out for meat alternatives, carbon capture, food digitization / data
analytics, and supply chains - all areas you really helped me understand
better in our call. If I come across a notable innovation in one of those
areas I'll pass them along!

In the meantime, let me know if you ever need a sounding board or an
additional view on cross-disciplinary tech innovation; the data analytics
side (and its integration into new markets) is one in particular where I
may have some insight.

Looking forward,
Josh
