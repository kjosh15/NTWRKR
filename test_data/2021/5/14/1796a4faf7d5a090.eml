For my folks, I was thinking:

Schedule:

   - Up at 7, exercise at 8, at work at 9 - 5 (or 6 depending on calls)
   bedtime with kids after dinner
   - When they get here plan schedule, then stick to it
   - expect to take a couple days off from work for trips, etc.
   - w/ it being summer vacation may shift slightly later, but would like
   to move to kids doing "learning" first thing in the day


Behavior:

   - This family's core values include respect; if anyone is being treated
   disrespectfully, ask them kindly to stop and reflect, or leave.
   - Being angry is ok. But whether you're 5 or 80, you need to be
   responsible and either stop and reflect, or leave.
   - If Dad cannot abide then we'll ask him to leave.


Drinking:

   - Don't drink two nights in a row
   - No more than 3 drinks a day
   - If Dad gets into his cups, leave. If we can't leave, ask him to.


Thoughts?

xoxo,
Josh
