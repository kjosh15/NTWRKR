Appreciate the warm reply Josh!

If it=E2=80=99s okay to coordinate a direct conversation I think =
that=E2=80=99d be a better way to articulate some of what we=E2=80=99re =
working on and see what could be the best collaboration for their org =
and ours! I would love a warm intro between us and you=E2=80=99re =
welcome on the call as well!

Is there a particular stakeholder in the organization that I can connect =
you with? In full transparency we worked with a very limited number of =
staff members this go around, but I think I can get an intro to an intro =
with clarity on the person you believe would be best. I have a warmer =
connection to the woman that is responsible for their Diversity efforts. =
Happy to help in any capacity you think makes sense.

Definitely understand the staffing needs, I=E2=80=99ll coordinate with a =
few friends in the Data space and see if they have connects they=E2=80=99d=
 be willing to make! The growth plan you outlined sounds really cool. =
Wishing you all the best!

Appreciate your energy and looking forward to connecting again soon,
