Mollie,

Thanks again for the call the other day; I hung up buzzing with ideas (as
ever, with you!!) It'll be a slow turnaround on my end but do please keep
me on your list.

Separately, I got ahold of Bill and he's amenable to the paperwork for
Foundry. You'd mentioned something about a template? If you can send, we'll
fill and file.

Very much obliged,
Josh
