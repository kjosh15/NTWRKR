*TL;DR: How to maximize M&A outcomes using FOMO?*

I've managed to get the attention of some senior folks at Deloitte,
Accenture, and KPMG, and EY is moving quickly - they're now promoting us
internally for a 190,000 employee company engagement and putting us in
front of an internal grown-up to evaluate the potential for making an
offer.

We've also got three great case studies just completed which show
significant, meaningful impact on retention, behavior change, and DE&I.

Meanwhile, the market is still converging on behavior metrics as a critical
function and potential savior in the face of distributed work, disrupted
supply chains, and the great resignation.

So, right place, right product, right time. That said, big consultancies
don't traditionally give the best multiples, our tech stack isn't as tight
as I would like, and we still have low ARR - so we don't have much
negotiation leverage. That leaves FOMO as our best bet.

The question is, how to best utilize this? I'm putting together a new M&A
deck now, but aside from telling everyone we're talking to everyone else
I'm not sure how to get people asking the "buy" question. At present I'm
saying we're just looking for partners - which is true - but that isn't
acting on the hunger I can hear in their voices.

Any tips?

- J
