Maya,

Thanks again for a good call yesterday; I really appreciated your quickly
getting alignment around key goals and next steps!

As mentioned, please find attached two additional case studies, around DE&I
and retention. I'm also including the write up we did for Sky around KPIs
in case it's useful internally.

Let me know what next steps on your side are.

All best,
Josh
