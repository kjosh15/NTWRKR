Saideep,

Wanted to follow up with another case study, this one focused on retention.
Again, we're not seeing any competitors in this space and are generating
significant impact for the client. Let me know when a call with your side
is possible; we're getting a lot of interest from the Big 4 and I'm quite
keen to see if there's a way to work together.

All best,
Josh
