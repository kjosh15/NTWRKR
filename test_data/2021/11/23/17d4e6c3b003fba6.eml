Hi Josh! Glad you like the site so far, I'd love to meet up over a call to=
=20
walk you through the work I've done so far. I realise that I may have=20
glossed over it in the video, but the site also offers the user to check=20
out Public Data (i.e. the number of coins deposited and crows that have=20
landed on the perch per country/location). I've been getting feedback from=
=20
some other users (who have not built a Crowbox) and they suggested making=
=20
the Public Data accessible to everyone (even those who have not created an=
=20
account). So currently I am in the process of building a 3D globe with bar=
=20
charts showing the data per country (for non authenticated users to view).=
=20

I plan on introducing methods for users who wish to operate offline to=20
upload their data as well (through an SD card). It would also be great for=
=20
users with cameras to have their footage uploaded (with their permission)=
=20
to their page. Maybe build something like a social media profile where=20
everyone can share their data and images/videos of the crowboxes being=20
used.=20

My work email is hq17616@bristol.ac.uk and my personal email is=20
qureshi.a.hamza@gmail.com. Feel free to email me so we can set something=20
up! Alternatively, we could open the meeting up to anyone else in the=20
community who would like to join and offer their insights. The more the=20
merrier.=20
