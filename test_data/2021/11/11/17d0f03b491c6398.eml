Amen on our kids' performances!! I always used to wonder why the heck my
dad would get all misty-eyed at my school plays. Now I know.

Can't do Tuesday, but offered 9am EST on Monday. Alternately I could do 10
or 11am EST Wednesday the 17th, noon on the 18th, or 10am on the 19th - let
me know if any of those times work for you!
