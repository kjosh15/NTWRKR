Brilliant, thanks very much for this, Steve. I've attached the last pitch
deck (aimed at investors, not buyers) which is now almost a year old - make
sure you have a drink in hand when you sit down to review; there's work to
be done here!

That said, lots of good news to catch you up on tomorrow morning which
might drive the import of a true M&A deck. For example, see the attached
updated Case Study for Sky, which we've just cleaned up to hand over to the
head of R&D at Accenture based on his request that he have something to
start a conversation with their head of customer services on... In my convo
with him yesterday he said he was asked for something specifically relevant
to call centers that was "fresh" and "differentiated." As you can see,
we're fairly well positioned for sales material, but have some real work to
do in preparing a viable M&A deck.

All best,
Josh
