Jerry,

I'm very sorry, but can we reschedule our call for the following Monday?
Does 9 or 10am EST Nov 15th work for you?

That said, lots to discuss - we've managed to get a reasonably high
correlation between our behavior data (values-led) and a major client's
KPIs, which is proving transformative to our conversations with the Big 4.
The idea that HR can now serve a highly operationalized function is rocking
some worlds - to say nothing of the implications for creating
values-aligned incetives as primary business drivers! (Just imagine what
you could do with DAOs...) Very much looking forward to speaking!!

Al best,
Josh
