Your Trusted Traveler membership will be expiring soon. If you wish to
renew your membership, you will need to log onto the Trusted Traveler
Programs (TTP) System website at https://ttp.dhs.gov/ to submit your
renewal application. The TTP system has replaced the Global Online
Enrollment System (GOES).

The TTP System website uses Login.gov for authentication. When you first
use the new TTP System website you will need to create a Login.gov account
if you do not already have one. For more information on Login.gov, visit
https://login.gov/. Please be advised that you will no longer be able to
use your GOES user ID/password to login to the TTP System.

You will need to provide your PASSID the first time you setup your profile.
Your PASSID, or membership number, can be located on the back of your TTP
card or on previous notification letters. This will allow the TTP System to
retrieve your information to facilitate the renewal process.

*Due to a significant increase in application volume, U.S. Customs and
Border Protection is extending the grace period from 6 months to 1 year for
any Trusted Traveler member who has a valid membership and who has
submitted a renewal application. This means you will continue to receive
full benefits for 1 year while U.S. Customs and Border Protection is
finalizing your renewal application. *
