Hey Taylor! Long time no speak; I hope you're doing well and have made it
through the last couple crazy years ok.

I recently realized I could pipe MP3s of tapes I'd ripped ages ago through
Shazam and directly to Spotify playlists. One of them was a mix tape from
your sister from that summer we directed Alice in Wonderland - could you
pass this on with my thanks?

Separately, I have a bunch of tapes from Tizzy and Mike Arnold, if you know
how to get ahold of either of them and if they're interested.

Let me know how life is treating you these days; if you're up for it I'd
love to reconnect!

All best,
Josh
