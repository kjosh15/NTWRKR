A few years ago, I was a member of a co-working space. The community norms =
and values of the space had been carefully nurtured by the three people tha=
t started it. Generosity and appreciation was encouraged and everyone knew =
it was important not to do anything that infringed upon anyone else=E2=80=
=99s enjoyment of the workplace.
Over time, some members moved away, while others moved in. People took jobs=
 that forced them to go back to regular offices and others spent more time =
at home with their kids. Little by little, our numbers were dwindling and w=
e found ourselves under the number of people we needed to pay the overhead.=
 We wanted to stay in that physical space, so we wound up merging with a st=
artup who needed at office. There were about ten indie coworkers from the o=
riginal community and ten employees of this startup.
The vibe of the community started to come apart quickly. What we realized w=
as that while our coworking crew all self-selected to join this communal sp=
ace, the employees of this startup were just kind of dragged along by the f=
ounder and told to work here. It was their office. They didn=E2=80=99t choo=
se to work here versus at a WeWork. They were told to report. They had no p=
rior reasons to care about the community or the space other than for its pu=
re utilitarian purpose of being a place to work.
Dishes started piling up, bathrooms got dirty, and a few other things start=
ed happening that forced a community meeting to discuss it. One thing I=E2=
=80=99ll never forget was that one of the startup employees, an engineer, c=
ouldn=E2=80=99t quite understand what we were asking when we said we wanted=
 them to be better members of the community.
He said, =E2=80=9CYou know what would be easier? If you just wrote up a lis=
t of rules for us to follow. That would make everything a lot more clear.=
=E2=80=9D
That=E2=80=99s the moment we knew it was never going to work. On one side, =
you had people who thought you could boil what being a good neighbor meant =
to a set of rigid rules anyone could follow=E2=80=94and on the other side y=
ou had folks who had built a community with a strong sense of culture throu=
gh a combination of member curation, care, engagement, and community activi=
ty.
In other words, they planted a seed in good soil, watered it, gave it light=
 and grew a flower.
They didn=E2=80=99t open up a box with a manual of instructions entitled, =
=E2=80=9CHow to Assemble Your Tulip.=E2=80=9D
I=E2=80=99ve been a part of a lot of different types of communities=E2=80=
=94but the one I think I=E2=80=99ve learned the most from is the volunteer =
kayaking boathouse [https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkE2OrDAMhE_TWSJiBw=

G8x6GT0ANCLx6cWoAQOHYcJauJLlZXUJZiuOwvMPV-aQ] I started on the East River i=
n 2010. Last year, even during a pandemic, we helped nearly 7,000 people ex=
perience human powered boating on the Brooklyn waterfront. We=E2=80=99re vo=
lunteer run and managed and in developing that community, I=E2=80=99ve lear=
ned a thing or two that makes me a bit skeptical about whether DAOs as we=
=E2=80=99re witnessing them today are going to make great organizations.
Purpose
The best organizations start out with a reason for being=E2=80=94and that r=
eason can=E2=80=99t just be to be an organization. We=E2=80=99ve seen lots =
of startups like that=E2=80=94a bunch of people who really want to start a =
company so they form a team and go looking for a problem to solve. That rar=
ely works out.
Our purpose at the Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse is to expose our local co=
mmunity to the waterfront=E2=80=94to a new activity build around an ecologi=
cal resource that should be publicly enjoyed for free. If you don=E2=80=99t=
 like the outdoors or people, and you=E2=80=99re not patient, generous or h=
ospitable, we=E2=80=99re not for you.
Too many DAOs are just experiments in crowdfunding or forms of financial ma=
rketplaces. These mechanisms are amazing ways to raise a boatload of money =
quickly or trade it, especially given how much untaxed wealth is locked up =
in crypto without enough utility=E2=80=94but the =E2=80=9Cwhat are we going=
 to do with the money once we raise it=E2=80=9D part has left a lot to be d=
esired. Massive sums are sitting on the sidelines just waiting to be more t=
han just money, or cynically, waiting to be able to be money just without t=
he whole capital gains part that comes with converting it back to fiat.
Meanwhile, the world is awash with complex problems that demand complex and=
 coordinated actions seemingly too thorny for DAO 1.0 to get a handle on=E2=
=80=94or perhaps those in the community just aren=E2=80=99t interested.
Speed
Our Boathouse started out with four founders and went through several stage=
s of growth. We didn=E2=80=99t go from one day per week of kayaking over th=
e summer to seven overnight. We started small and grew organically, taking =
on new dates and times when we felt our organization was ready both in term=
s of people power, but also in terms of maturity. Our program relies a lot =
on trust and teamwork=E2=80=94things that don=E2=80=99t come out of a rule =
book. They come from shared experience, personal engagement and familiarity=
=2E
You can=E2=80=99t write down how to do every single job well. You have to l=
earn it for yourself and then teach it to a wide variety of people. Then, y=
ou look at the people you=E2=80=99ve got, and you make iterations on whethe=
r or not the people you have is who you want. You want to understand who yo=
u need, how to attract them, and how to make the most of the people you hav=
e. This just takes time to do well, because the bottleneck isn=E2=80=99t te=
ch. It=E2=80=99s human relationships. Call me old school, but I don=E2=80=
=99t think they can be so easily distilled out to token based voting and ri=
gid rules.
Of course, that all presupposes you=E2=80=99re actually trying to build an =
organization. If you=E2=80=99re just trying to build a marketplace, then su=
re, everyone can work within the marketplace as an interoperable commodity=
=E2=80=94but communities of humans tend to abhor commoditization. That=E2=
=80=99s why experienced lawyers tend to get pretty bored when you make them=
 hand out water at the cancer walk. It=E2=80=99s the only way the cancer wa=
lk organizers can manage 500 volunteers at once, but you=E2=80=99re really =
wasting a very valuable legal mind in there if you don=E2=80=99t figure out=
 how to treat everyone individually. It takes time to get to know who is go=
od at what and how they can best contribute.
If it didn=E2=80=99t, the company culture part of hypergrowth would be supe=
r easy.
On top of that, one of my biggest issues with speed is hype. Great communit=
ies often take time to be underground for a little while=E2=80=94like a see=
dling building up its roots before it sprouts. That time has now been shrun=
k to zero. We went from no one ever hearing about a DAO to trying to buy th=
e Constitution in like a year. The conference circuit has swarmed on the DA=
O and NFT worlds far more swiftly than it took Deloitte to discover SXSW. T=
hat brings all sorts of bad actors or just people creating noise, making it=
 difficult to grow strong and organically.
Some People=E2=80=99s Opinions are Bad
When=E2=80=99s the last time you were in a big group of people and you came=
 to the best outcome by saying, =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s all vote on it!=E2=
=80=9D
The reality is that people come to various problems with a wide variety of =
experiences and knowledge levels and so, for any given problem, you probabl=
y don=E2=80=99t want everyone voting on everything. There=E2=80=99s such a =
thing as expertise. There=E2=80=99s also a thing that big communities are o=
ften known to vote against their own collective self interest. Why? People =
are selfish, short term minded, and they don=E2=80=99t always see the big p=
icture.
Sometimes, you do need to work out thorny problems in closed door committee=
s=E2=80=94because solution finding shouldn=E2=80=99t always be a public pop=
ularity contest.
I can=E2=80=99t tell you how many people join our kayaking Boathouse and im=
mediately have opinions about how things should be run on their first day. =
I=E2=80=99m happy to actively listen, but I can tell you that 99.9% of the =
ideas they have they would learn aren=E2=80=99t that good if they spent mor=
e than two weeks volunteering.
Bias
=E2=80=9CDAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks =
around the globe=E2=80=9D.
That=E2=80=99s how the Ethereum Foundation describes them. They=E2=80=99re,=
 by definition, bringing you together with like-minded people. Is that the =
best way to work towards a goal? Is it the best way to be a better person t=
hrough your work and to learn how to negotiate and respectfully disagree?
It=E2=80=99s not surprising to me that a crypto centric company like Coinba=
se simply couldn=E2=80=99t figure out how to deal with the lack of like-min=
dedness in humans in a healthy way so they decided the rule was just keep y=
our mind on your work and nothing else.
That sounds like a pretty shitty organization if you ask me=E2=80=94one tha=
t asks me to check who I am at the door and become a commodity. Is that wha=
t we want DAOs to be?
Communities self-select and bring with them in their development their own =
biases. I=E2=80=99m quite sure that our kayaking community, despite being f=
ree to the public and fairly diverse in both its leadership and its partici=
pants is somewhat ablest in its approach. Basically all of the people who p=
articipate can propel themselves in a kayak, albeit at various skill levels=
=2E
Similarly, right now, the tech required to participate in a DAO represents =
a significant hurdle to diversity=E2=80=94a problem the technology world al=
ready had. It=E2=80=99s not that anyone can=E2=80=99t access a crypto walle=
t. Regardless of how easy or hard you think it is, everyone hasn=E2=80=99t=
=E2=80=94and what I=E2=80=99d argue is more of a barrier than even the know=
ledge or the broadband access.
It=E2=80=99s time.
Free time is a privilage that you don=E2=80=99t necessarily have if you=E2=
=80=99re a single parent trying to raise three kids=E2=80=94or you=E2=80=99=
re someone trying to work multiple jobs to put a roof over your head.
We run the risk of magnifying the problems a bunch of mostly straight white=
 guys who had the wealth of time to learn to code built into social network=
s and Web 2.0 exponentially.
Web3 talks about democratization but it=E2=80=99s amazing how quickly decen=
tralization, libertarianism, and generalized lack of concern for underrepre=
sented and disadvantaged groups go hand in hand. I find that most of the pe=
ople trying to get government out of the way of things aren=E2=80=99t exact=
ly the biggest champions of equality in actual practice.
Hope?
This all being said, we=E2=80=99re getting better and better at growing liv=
ing tissue in labs. One day, we might be able to assemble a tulip rather th=
an need to grow it organically. I=E2=80=99m not sure that analogy will nece=
ssarily translate to human coordination. I think more of humans than I do o=
f tech=E2=80=94and I don=E2=80=99t think we so easily get fit into just bei=
ng cogs. When technology learns how to treat us humanely, individually and =
actually makes us better people to each other=E2=80=94maybe we=E2=80=99ll g=
et there.
I=E2=80=99d like to see DAOs where joining actually influences me to act be=
tter when I=E2=80=99m not participating in the community=E2=80=94and ones t=
hat incentivize generosity over my own self interest (which would be hard i=
f I have financial ownership=E2=80=94which always kind of makes me a bit of=
 a speculator if I can ever cash out).
Moreover, I=E2=80=99d love to see DAOs built by people who have built reall=
y healthy and diverse offline communities that create positive change in th=
e world.

a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">A few years =
ago, I was a member of a co-working space. The community norms and values o=
f the space had been carefully nurtured by the three people that started it=
=2E Generosity and appreciation was encou=
raged and everyone knew it was impor=
tant not to do anything that infringed upon anyone else&#8217;s enjoyment o=
f the workplace.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-heigh=
t: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Over time, some members moved away, while othe=
rs moved in. People took jobs that forced them to go back to regular office=
s and others spent more time at home with their kids. Little by little, our=
 numbers were dwindling and we found ourselves under the number of people w=
e needed to pay the overhead. We wanted to stay in that physical space, so =
we wound up merging with a startup who needed at office. There were about t=
en indie coworkers from the original community and ten employees of this st=
artup.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; m=
argin: 0 0 1em 0;">The vibe of the community started to come apart quickly.=
 What we realized was that while our coworking crew all self-selected to jo=
in this communal space, the employees of this startup were just kind of dra=
gged along by the founder and told to work here. It was their office. They =
didn&#8217;t choose to work here versus at a WeWork. They were told to repo=
rt. They had no prior reasons to care about the community or the space othe=
r than for its pure utilitarian purpose of being a place to work.</p><p sty=
le=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0=
;">Dishes started piling up, bathrooms got dirty, and a few other things st=
arted happening that forced a community meeting to discuss it. One thing I&=
#8217;ll never forget was that one of the startup employees, an engineer, c=
ouldn&#8217;t quite understand what we were asking when we said we wanted t=
hem to be better members of the community.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; f=
ont-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">He said, <em>&#8220;=
You know what would be easier? If you just wrote up a list of rules for us =
to follow. That would make everything a lot more clear.&#8221;</em></p><p s=
tyle=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em=
 0;">That&#8217;s the moment we knew it was never going to work. On one sid=
e, you had people who thought you could boil what being a good neighbor mea=
nt to a set of rigid rules anyone could follow&#8212;and on the other side =
you had folks who had built a community with a strong sense of culture thro=
ugh a combination of member curation, care, engagement, and community activ=
ity.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; mar=

 started on the East River in 2010. Last year, even during a pandemic, we h=
elped nearly 7,000 people experience human powered boating on the Brooklyn =
waterfront. We&#8217;re volunteer run and managed and in developing that co=
mmunity, I&#8217;ve learned a thing or two that makes me a bit skeptical ab=
out whether DAOs as we&#8217;re witnessing them today are going to make gre=
at organizations.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-heig=

: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">The best=
 organizations start out with a reason for being&#8212;and that reason can&=
#8217;t just be to be an organization. We&#8217;ve seen lots of startups li=
ke that&#8212;a bunch of people who really want to start a company so they =
form a team and go looking for a problem to solve. That rarely works out.</=
p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0=
 0 1em 0;">Our purpose at the Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse is to expose o=
ur local community to the waterfront&#8212;to a new activity build around a=
n ecological resource that should be publicly enjoyed for free. If you don&=
#8217;t like the outdoors or people, and you&#8217;re not patient, generous=
 or hospitable, we&#8217;re not for you.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; fon=
t-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Too many DAOs are just=
 experiments in crowdfunding or forms of financial marketplaces. These mech=
anisms are amazing ways to raise a boatload of money quickly or trade it, e=
specially given how much untaxed wealth is locked up in crypto without enou=
gh utility&#8212;but the &#8220;what are we going to do with the money once=
 we raise it&#8221; part has left a lot to be desired. Massive sums are sit=
ting on the sidelines just waiting to be more than just money, or cynically=
, waiting to be able to be money just without the whole capital gains part =
that comes with converting it back to fiat.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; =
font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Meanwhile, the worl=
d is awash with complex problems that demand complex and coordinated action=
s seemingly too thorny for DAO 1.0 to get a handle on&#8212;or perhaps thos=
e in the community just aren&#8217;t interested.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1=
a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;"><strong>Speed<=
/strong></p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;=
 margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Our Boathouse started out with four founders and went =
through several stages of growth. We didn&#8217;t go from one day per week =
of kayaking over the summer to seven overnight. We started small and grew o=
rganically, taking on new dates and times when we felt our organization was=
 ready both in terms of people power, but also in terms of maturity. Our pr=
ogram relies a lot on trust and teamwork&#8212;things that don&#8217;t come=
 out of a rule book. They come from shared experience, personal engagement =
and familiarity.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-heigh=
t: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">You can&#8217;t write down how to do every sin=
gle job well. You have to learn it for yourself and then teach it to a wide=
 variety of people. Then, you look at the people you&#8217;ve got, and you =
make iterations on whether or not the people you have is who you want. You =
want to understand who you need, how to attract them, and how to make the m=
ost of the people you have. This just takes time to do well, because the bo=
ttleneck isn&#8217;t tech. It&#8217;s human relationships. Call me old scho=
ol, but I don&#8217;t think they can be so easily distilled out to token ba=
sed voting and rigid rules.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px;=
 line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Of course, that all presupposes you=
&#8217;re actually trying to build an organization. If you&#8217;re just tr=
ying to build a marketplace, then sure, everyone can work within the market=
place as an interoperable commodity&#8212;but communities of humans tend to=
 abhor commoditization. That&#8217;s why experienced lawyers tend to get pr=
etty bored when you make them hand out water at the cancer walk. It&#8217;s=
 the only way the cancer walk organizers can manage 500 volunteers at once,=
 but you&#8217;re really wasting a very valuable legal mind in there if you=
 don&#8217;t figure out how to treat everyone individually. It takes time t=
o get to know who is good at what and how they can best contribute.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em=
 0;">If it didn&#8217;t, the company culture part of hypergrowth would be s=
uper easy.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26p=
x; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">On top of that, one of my biggest issues with speed =
is hype. Great communities often take time to be underground for a little w=
hile&#8212;like a seedling building up its roots before it sprouts. That ti=
me has now been shrunk to zero. We went from no one ever hearing about a DA=
O to trying to buy the Constitution in like a year. The conference circuit =
has swarmed on the DAO and NFT worlds far more swiftly than it took Deloitt=
e to discover SXSW. That brings all sorts of bad actors or just people crea=
ting noise, making it difficult to grow strong and organically.</p><p style=

 I can tell you that 99.9% of the ideas they have they would learn aren&#82=

espite being free to the public and fairly diverse in both its leadership a=

 access a crypto wallet. Regardless of how easy or hard you think it is, ev=
