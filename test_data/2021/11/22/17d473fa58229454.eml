Understood. I doubt we'll be able to get it done before Jan, but let's see
how it goes.

I feel a bit guilty putting this on you in the midst of you busy <br>
progress with Indigometrics. However, this is where we are at:<br>
<br>
&quot;Please accept our sincere apologies for the caused inconvenience.<br>
<br>
We would like to inform you that the issue was investigated by our <br>
System Administrators. Unfortunately, the email services used by you are <b=

located under an old Windows 2003 server. This is the reason why <br>
Thunderbird cant connects on those SSL ports. The only option for <br>
Thunderbird to be connected with the SSL ports will be a migration to a <br=
>
newer server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bear in mind that when we set up your mother&#39;s web site we sprcifically=
 <br>
requested - and got - a Linux server. This leads me to think this is a <br>
lot of BS to get us to move. As I mentioned to you a year or so ago, at <br=
>
our ages it is probably a good idea to have you have access to our <br>
accounts so that in the event we are unable to deal with matters you can <b=

access the accounts.<br>
<br>
Our current situation is:<br>
<br>
On Hostmysite - their US no. is 877-215-4678 (available 24/7)<br>

Your mother, at this point, says she doesn&#39;t want her web site. This is=
 <br>
something you should probably review with her - to be sure she isn&#39;t, <=

for example, just trying to avoid work for me.<br>
<br>
We don&#39;t, to my knowledge, use any mail accounts associated with this U=

Questions and further information:<br>

Is all your stuff on a commercial server, or a private server? I, of <br>

use all 4 (and move many emails from the server to local folders on the <br=
