Saideep,

Good talking to you earlier this week! As discussed, please find a case
study on our recent project using behavior correlated KPIs in a large call
center client. Would love to speak with Edwin (?) about how our data could
be similarly used in this space to form a pilot so we can explore more
broad partnering.

Also, if you end up with nothing to do in London let me know; my cofounder
is based there!

All best,
Josh
