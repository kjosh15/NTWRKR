What do you think about this as a gift for the folks? Interview them and get=
 a professionally produced podcast of their story together. It=E2=80=99s a l=
ittle pricey, but if we call it a gift from all three of us maybe=E2=80=A6? A=
lso call if a gift to the grandkids? I just really like the idea of someone e=
lse pulling out a narrative (and making it succinct!) for our folks=E2=80=99=
 lives!!!
