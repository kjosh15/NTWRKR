Joshua,

I feel a bit guilty putting this on you in the midst of you busy 
progress with Indigometrics. However, this is where we are at:

"Please accept our sincere apologies for the caused inconvenience.

We would like to inform you that the issue was investigated by our 
System Administrators. Unfortunately, the email services used by you are 
located under an old Windows 2003 server. This is the reason why 
Thunderbird cant connects on those SSL ports. The only option for 
Thunderbird to be connected with the SSL ports will be a migration to a 
newer server."

Bear in mind that when we set up your mother's web site we sprcifically 
requested - and got - a Linux server. This leads me to think this is a 
lot of BS to get us to move. As I mentioned to you a year or so ago, at 
our ages it is probably a good idea to have you have access to our 
accounts so that in the event we are unable to deal with matters you can 
access the accounts.

Our current situation is:

On Hostmysite - their US no. is 877-215-4678 (available 24/7)

Your mother's web site; KarenKleinArt.com

     When you log in to "my.hostmysite.com" the user name is "jkleinh4" 
password see other message on (347)...

Note that when you do this you see, "Currently Managing Linux Pro 
(karenkleinart.com):77801 [they say we are on a Windows 2003 server]. 
Your mother, at this point, says she doesn't want her web site. This is 
something you should probably review with her - to be sure she isn't, 
for example, just trying to avoid work for me.

We don't, to my knowledge, use any mail accounts associated with this URL

We also own "The_Kleins.us" held here and unused - to be discarded.

We have "AGoodDay.today" which is held by GoDaddy and pointed to the 
"KarenKleinArt.com" URL. Mailboxes/Passwords under this URL are

KLKArtist@AGoodDay.today/N

Enologist@AGoodDat.today/

JKK@AGoodDay.today/

root@AGoodDay.today/

In addition, we both have gmail accounts, which are forwarded to our 
Thunderbird accounts (and, somehow - I believe - also show up in our 
iPad email app).

Questions and further information:

Is all your stuff on a commercial server, or a private server? I, of 
course will want to be able to access our accounts to clean them up, 
make additions or changes. Because your mother uses 3 1/2 computers 
(cellphone, iPad, laptop and occasionally the desktop - the "1/2") and I 
use all 4 (and move many emails from the server to local folders on the 
desktop and archive them there) we need IMAP accounts.

If it's a commercial server, I suggested to your mother that we could 
use AGoodDay as a URL where she could post her art and we could jointly 
use it for things we want to share with the family (realizing they are 
open to the world) so that, for example, Jill or Yvonne could see pics 
of our trip to Iceland. Most commercial hosts have website templates 
that, I hope, your mother could become comfortable using. The whole web 
site thing is a soft maybe.

How do you suggest we proceed?

Love,

DAD
