I feel a bit guilty putting this on you in the midst of you busy <br>
progress with Indigometrics. However, this is where we are at:<br>
<br>
&quot;Please accept our sincere apologies for the caused inconvenience.<br>
<br>
We would like to inform you that the issue was investigated by our <br>
System Administrators. Unfortunately, the email services used by you are <b=
r>
located under an old Windows 2003 server. This is the reason why <br>
Thunderbird cant connects on those SSL ports. The only option for <br>
Thunderbird to be connected with the SSL ports will be a migration to a <br=
>
newer server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bear in mind that when we set up your mother&#39;s web site we sprcifically=
 <br>
requested - and got - a Linux server. This leads me to think this is a <br>
lot of BS to get us to move. As I mentioned to you a year or so ago, at <br=
>
our ages it is probably a good idea to have you have access to our <br>
accounts so that in the event we are unable to deal with matters you can <b=
r>
access the accounts.<br>
<br>
Our current situation is:<br>
<br>
On Hostmysite - their US no. is 877-215-4678 (available 24/7)<br>
<br>
Your mother&#39;s web site; KarenKleinArt.com<br>
<br>
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 When you log in to &quot;<a href=3D"http://my.host=
mysite.com" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">my.hostmysite.com</a>&quot=
; the user name is &quot;jkleinh4&quot; <br>
password see other message on (347)...<br>
<br>
Note that when you do this you see, &quot;Currently Managing Linux Pro <br>
(<a href=3D"http://karenkleinart.com" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">=
karenkleinart.com</a>):77801 [they say we are on a Windows 2003 server]. <b=
r>
Your mother, at this point, says she doesn&#39;t want her web site. This is=
 <br>
something you should probably review with her - to be sure she isn&#39;t, <=
br>
for example, just trying to avoid work for me.<br>
<br>
We don&#39;t, to my knowledge, use any mail accounts associated with this U=
RL<br>
<br>
We also own &quot;The_Kleins.us&quot; held here and unused - to be discarde=
d.<br>
<br>
We have &quot;AGoodDay.today&quot; which is held by GoDaddy and pointed to =
the <br>
&quot;KarenKleinArt.com&quot; URL. Mailboxes/Passwords under this URL are<b=

Enologist@AGoodDat.today/<br>
<br>
JKK@AGoodDay.today/<br>
<br>
root@AGoodDay.today/<br>
<br>
In addition, we both have gmail accounts, which are forwarded to our <br>
Thunderbird accounts (and, somehow - I believe - also show up in our <br>
iPad email app).<br>
<br>
Questions and further information:<br>
<br>
Is all your stuff on a commercial server, or a private server? I, of <br>
course will want to be able to access our accounts to clean them up, <br>
make additions or changes. Because your mother uses 3 1/2 computers <br>
(cellphone, iPad, laptop and occasionally the desktop - the &quot;1/2&quot;=
) and I <br>
use all 4 (and move many emails from the server to local folders on the <br=
>
desktop and archive them there) we need IMAP accounts.<br>
<br>
If it&#39;s a commercial server, I suggested to your mother that we could <=
br>
use AGoodDay as a URL where she could post her art and we could jointly <br=
>
use it for things we want to share with the family (realizing they are <br>
open to the world) so that, for example, Jill or Yvonne could see pics <br>
of our trip to Iceland. Most commercial hosts have website templates <br>
that, I hope, your mother could become comfortable using. The whole web <br=
>
site thing is a soft maybe.<br>
<br>
How do you suggest we proceed?<br>

Love,<br>
