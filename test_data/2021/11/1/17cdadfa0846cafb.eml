Halloween was pretty good; just the family, but enthusiasm galore.

We've got Mario Kart on my phone, and I'm installing it on Othinn's laptop
- apparently it's compatible across platforms so (hopefully?) should work
altogether; we're just using the free client. I'll try to test it out this
week!

All best,
Josh
