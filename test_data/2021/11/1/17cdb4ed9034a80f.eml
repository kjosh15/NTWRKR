Good seeing you on the summit; I thought they did a great job, given it was
yet-another-zoom!

I wanted to see if you thought it was worth setting up another call with
Jamie and Claire to discuss Indigometrics. We've made a number of advances
to the platform that might be relevant, but I don't want to pester folks if
everything is tabled until Q1 '22. Let me know if it's worth my pushing in
the meantime.

All the best,
Josh
