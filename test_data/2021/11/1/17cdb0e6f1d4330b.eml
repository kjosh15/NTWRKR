Lauren, Nate, Tom,

Thanks for the time on Friday; despite the truncated call it was hugely
refreshing to get your take on the Indigometrics platform and ideas around
how we could collaborate. Let me know when would work after the 9th to walk
you through the sandbox; we can dig into the data behind it as well as some
of the new features we've got that might be relevant to your challenge
specifically.

Looking forward to it,
- J
