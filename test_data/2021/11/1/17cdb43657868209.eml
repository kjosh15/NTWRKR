Hey John, just looping back around to see if there's anything further to be
done on my end for the Katzenback Center, and/or if there's anyone else at
PWC who might be worth talking with. We're getting some strong interest
from two of the other big four and wanted to make sure we had a chance to
make the case for partnership with PwC. Let me know what you suggest!

All best,
Josh
