Hey Josh,
Sorry it=E2=80=99s been a while. Accenture is slow rolling the move; they h=
ave
pushed out a decision until February. They still seem confident that
they=E2=80=99ll move forward, but at the moment I=E2=80=99m in limbo.
In the meantime, K is ramping up my role.
Let=E2=80=99s find time to chat, next week. Let me know some times.
Thanks,
Kes
