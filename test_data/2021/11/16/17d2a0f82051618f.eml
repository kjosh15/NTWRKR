We ARE slow! Everything gets planned in semester or year-long blocks, and
our incentive system valorizes publications that take 3 years from
"brilliant idea" to "appears in print."
I think the best bet for Indigometrics is to find smart PhD students
shopping for a dissertation topic on "culture and people analytics" or
something similar. MIT and Wharton are exactly the right 2 schools to find
such folks (they are the only two name-brand schools that still have
anything like HR/industrial relations scholars). That being said, I'd love
to brainstorm some project ideas that academics would want to implement and
that would be useful for the biz.
