10,000 feet here, but I want to distill the vision of the future that
Indigo plays a part of. Thoughts?

#######

The future of work is distributed, autonomous, and permeable - many
discrete parts loosely joined and dynamically coupling as quickly changing
market conditions demand.

It is also a global future, where pricing will be set more by universal
rates and availability than disparate local conditions. This males price a
minor point of leverage.

In this future, values allow organizations to coordinate flexibly across
swiftly moving targets by retreating even further from micromanagement. At
the same time, values provide an inviolable hedge against competition for
talent as well as producing significant new consumer appeal.

What is required for success in this future is a set of value metrics which
translate directly to key operational behaviors and deliverables. A =E2=80=
=9CP&L of
culture=E2=80=9D that allows leaders to manage their entire organization by=
 driving
values and managing returns (evolving KPIs) instead of endlessly
implementing slow-moving burocratic processes.

Indigometrics is that tool. The future is values led. Will you be a part of
it?
