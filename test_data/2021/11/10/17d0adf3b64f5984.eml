Maya,

Thanks so much for the call yesterday; it sounds as though there's a lot of
overlap and I'm excited to get an actual engagement set up so we can
mutually kick the tires and start mapping out the potential.

As per our conversation our senior contact in the UK is Austin Swain
<https://www.ey.com/en_uk/people/austin-swain>. He's led the project there
which produced a lot of our substantiation around KPIs + Behavior Data. He
can speak in detail about what it's like to work with us.

Separately, I'm happy to send the partnership agreement we used with EY UK;
they've done all the necessary due diligence and my hope is this can
expedite the process of being able to work together. Let me know if that
works as a next step or if something else is needed.

As you noted, the market is very aggressive and my top priority is to get a
pilot in place as quickly as possible so we can demonstrate mutual value.
Let me know if a quick call this week or next would be helpful to that end.

All best wishes; I'm excited to see how we can work together soon!
- J
