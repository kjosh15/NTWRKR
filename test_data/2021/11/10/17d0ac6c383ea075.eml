That's great news! Next steps are to get some basic info on the client,
size of pilot, types of values for the org, and correlation to your
services. Might be easiest to set up a call so we can make sure this pilot
embodies potential future value for Flow Research Collective. Let me know
when you're available (plus as much of the above as you're comfortable
sending!)

All best,
Josh
