I'm checking in again based on our LinkedIn conversation regarding a large
client we have who needs a transformation effort off the back of our data.
We're really excited about the potential for this sort of JV and are keen
to learn more about your services. Can you let us know if any times here
<http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or can you suggest a time GMT that works
for a short call?

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

CEO, Indigometrics
