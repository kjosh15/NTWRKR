Stablecoin report=20

A few years ago, the hot thing in crypto was the =E2=80=9Cinitial coin offe=
ring.=E2=80=9D I=20
could tell you a story in which initial coin offerings represented a truly=
=20
new and interesting way to fund projects. Before ICOs came along, projects=
=20
=E2=80=94 say, the development of a new internet thing =E2=80=94 might be f=
unded by a=20
corporation, which would then own the project and make a lot of money if it=
=20
succeeded. Or they might be created by volunteers in an open-source system,=
=20
and then nobody would own the project or get rich. Or they might be funded=
=20
by the government, which would then control the project and give it away or=
=20
whatever. But the ICO said: =E2=80=9CWe can fund projects with money from t=
heir=20
potential users, and then if the projects work out those *users *will get=
=20
rich.=E2=80=9D

This was an interesting idea=20

=80=99s=20
interesting, though, is for incentives. When corporations fund projects,=20

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission looked at it and didn=E2=80=99t=

in part because a lot of it felt Ponzi-ish. And their reaction was to say,=
=20
well, this is basically the same thing as a corporation selling stock. So=
=20
we will treat it as a corporation selling stock, and regulate ICOs as=20
securities offerings. You will need to register the ICO with the SEC, and=
=20
give investors audited financial statements, and generally act like a=20
corporation selling stock.=20

But it wasn=E2=80=99t the same thing as a corporation selling stock! I mean=
, look,=20
it kind of was; a lot of ICOs were just corporations selling stock, but in=
=20
scammier ways. But the *core concept *of the ICO was new and different; it=
=20
was *not *a way for a corporation to fund a project that it would then own=
=20
and profit from, but a way for a community to fund a project that no one=20
would own and that its users could profit from. And by shoving it into the=
=20
preexisting concepts of securities law, the SEC sort of killed it. There is=
=20
not, it turns out, a way for a community to fund a project that no one=20
would own and that its users could profit from, under U.S. law. Oh well.=20

I don=E2=80=99t want to say that stablecoins are the hot new thing in crypt=
o now,=20
or that they are a new and interesting way to do anything. A stablecoin is=
=20
a cryptocurrency that is supposed to always be worth a dollar. There are=20
various ways to do that. The main ones are a =E2=80=9Cbacked stablecoin,=E2=

How should stablecoins be regulated? I don=E2=80=99t know. But here is the =

:

Legislation should address the risks outlined in this report by=20
establishing an appropriate federal prudential framework for payment=20
stablecoin arrangements. In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers,=
=20
legislation should provide for supervision on a consolidated basis;=20
prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropriate components of=
=20
the federal safety net. To accomplish these objectives, legislation should=
=20
limit stablecoin issuance, and related activities of redemption and=20
maintenance of reserve assets, to entities that are insured depository=20
institutions. The legislation would prohibit other entities from issuing=20
payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors have=
=20
authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among=20
stablecoins.

Insured depository institutions include both state and federally chartered=
=20
banks and savings associations, the deposits of which are covered, subject=
=20
to legal limits, by deposit insurance, and which have access to emergency=
=20
liquidity and Federal Reserve services. Like other insured depository=20
institutions, insured depository institutions that issue stablecoins would=
=20
be subject to supervision and regulation at the depository institution=20
level by a federal banking agency and consolidated supervision and=20
regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level. The=20
standards to which these institutions are subject include capital and=20
liquidity standards that are designed to address safety and soundness and,=
=20
for the largest banking organizations, also include enhanced prudential=20
standards that address financial stability concerns. Under the Federal=20
Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions also are subject to=
=20
a special resolution regime that enables the orderly resolution of failed=
=20
insured depository institutions by, among other mechanisms, protecting=20
customers=E2=80=99 insured deposits, and according priority to deposit clai=
ms over=20
those of general creditors, and limits any potential negative systemic=20
impacts in the event of bank failure.

That just says that, if U.S. regulators have their way, only banks will be=
=20
allowed to issue stablecoins.[2] And they will be subject to capital and=20
liquidity regulation and prudential oversight and stress testing and all=20
the other regulatory apparatus of U.S. banks. You can read the report to=20
see what the regulators are worried about; it is all pretty straightforward=
=20
stuff:

Stablecoins and stablecoin-related activities present a variety of risks.=
=20
Speculative digital asset trading, which may involve the use of stablecoins=
=20
to move easily between digital asset platforms or in decentralized finance=
=20
(DeFi) arrangements, presents risks related to market integrity and=20
investor protection. These market integrity and investor protection risks=
=20
encompass possible fraud and misconduct in digital asset trading, including=
=20
market manipulation, insider trading, and front running, as well as a lack=
=20
of trading or price transparency. Where these activities involve complex=20
relationships or significant amounts of leverage, there may also be risks=
=20
to the broader financial system. =E2=80=A6

Stablecoins also pose illicit finance concerns and risks to financial=20
integrity, including concerns related to compliance with rules governing=20
anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)=
=20
and proliferation. =E2=80=A6

In addition to market integrity, investor protection, and illicit finance=
=20
concerns, the potential for the increased use of stablecoins as a means of=
=20
payment raises a range of prudential concerns. If stablecoin issuers do not=
=20
honor a request to redeem a stablecoin, or if users lose confidence in a=20
stablecoin issuer=E2=80=99s ability to honor such a request, runs on the=20
arrangement could occur that may result in harm to users and the broader=20
financial system. Further, to the extent stablecoins are widely used to=20
facilitate payments, disruptions to the payment chain that allows=20
stablecoins to be transferred among users could lead to a loss of payments=
=20
efficiency and safety and undermine the functioning of the broader economy.=
=20

I do not find these concerns particularly persuasive =E2=80=94 *non*-stable=
coins=20
are at least as big of a fraud and illicit-finance problem as stablecoins,=
=20
and every day now there are huge crypto scams, runs and rug-pulls that seem=
=20
to have no effect at all on the broader financial system =E2=80=94 but a lo=
t of=20
people do and, you know, fine. They=E2=80=99re real concerns, and they do a=
rgue for=20
some regulation and oversight of stablecoins.

But what I want to emphasize here is that in the traditional financial=20
system, people spend lots of time building =E2=80=9Cstablecoins=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=94 in the sense of,=20
dollar-deposit-like products =E2=80=94 whose whole point is that they are n=
ot=20
issued by insured depository institutions. And when they do that, U.S.=20
financial regulators mostly say =E2=80=9Caha, good one, you got us, you sca=
mps,=E2=80=9D=20
and propose mild regulations to make those products a bit safer and less=20
run-prone. They do not say =E2=80=9Cwait, you are trying to make a product =
that is=20
always worth a dollar, you've got to do that in a bank.=E2=80=9D[3] A certa=
in=20
amount of experimentation is allowed.

Perhaps that is terrible! Again, a lot of people do legitimately think it=
=E2=80=99s=20
terrible. Similarly, in crypto, having many billions of dollars invested in=
 a=20
thing=20

=20
can trust the blockchain, nobody can trust that transfers on the blockchain=
=20
are final, nobody can trust that they own the things that the blockchain=20
says they own.

Another reading is: No, this is good. It is in general too easy to trick=20
crypto people out of their crypto, and that is *bad*, bad for the people=20
who lose their crypto and also for confidence in and adoption of the=20
ecosystem. It is better for widely influential central parties, like=20

there=E2=80=99s been no signed contract between the companies yet. ...

=E2=80=9CAs we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,=
000=20
Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging infrastructure=
=20
across the company=E2=80=99s global operations,=E2=80=9D Hertz said in an e=

Tuesday. =E2=80=9CDeliveries of the Teslas already have started. We are see=
ing very=20
strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market=
=20
demand for Tesla vehicles.=E2=80=9D ...

In his Monday night tweet, Musk said that because Tesla has demand for more=
=20
vehicles than it can produce, the deal with Hertz =E2=80=9Chas zero effect =
on our=20
economics.=E2=80=9D Tesla shares slumped as much as 6.9% before the start o=
f=20
regular trading Tuesday, after soaring 56% during the past month to give=20
the EV-maker a market valuation above $1 trillion.

If your plan is to buy 100,000 Teslas when they become available and pay=20
full retail price for them, you don=E2=80=99t actually need a signed contra=
ct? What=20
you do is you go to Tesla=E2=80=99s website and click on the model you want=
 to buy=20
and click =E2=80=9Corder now=E2=80=9D and it will let you customize your ca=
r and give you=20
an estimated delivery date. And you do that 100,000 times, and then you=20
wait, and eventually you get 100,000 Teslas. Obviously this is not the=20
*ideal *way to do it. If you sign a corporate-level contract with Tesla,=20
you only have to fill out the form once, instead of 100,000 times. But if=
=20
the contract says =E2=80=9CTesla will deliver you your cars when it has fil=
led the=20
orders of everyone ahead of you in line, no promises on exactly when, and=
=20
it will charge you the prices on its website,=E2=80=9D then going to the we=
bsite is=20
a pretty close substitute for signing a contract.[4]

The basic fact here is that when Hertz announced that it was going to buy=
=20
100,000 Teslas, (1) its stock shot up and (2) Tesla=E2=80=99s stock shot up=
. Tesla=20
selling cars to Hertz is great for Tesla and great for Hertz. If that keeps=

being true, you don=E2=80=99t really need any discounts or commitments or=

enforcement mechanisms or indemnities or choice-of-law clauses or whatever.=

Hertz can just buy cars and Tesla can just sell them.

Zillow Group Inc. is looking to sell about 7,000 homes as it seeks to=20
recover from a fumble in its high-tech home-flipping business.

The company is seeking roughly $2.8 billion for the houses, which are being=
=20
pitched to institutional investors, according to people familiar with the=
=20
matter. Zillow will likely sell the properties to a multitude of buyers=20
rather than packaging them in a single transaction, said the people, who=20
asked not to be named because the matter is private. =E2=80=A6

The move to offload homes comes as Zillow seeks to recover from an=20
operational stumble that saw it buy too many houses, with many now being=20
listed for less than it paid. The company typically offers smaller numbers=
=20
of homes to single-family landlords, but the current sales effort is much=
=20
larger than normal. =E2=80=A6

An analysis of 650 homes owned by Zillow showed that two-thirds were priced=
=20
for less than the company bought them for, according to an Oct. 31 note=20
from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

=E2=80=9CI think they leaned into home-price appreciation at exactly the wr=
ong=20
moment,=E2=80=9D said Ed Yruma, an analyst at KeyBanc.=20

You could have a model where in, like, 10 years, Zillow will be really=20
really good at pricing houses, and it will always buy houses for exactly=20
the price it can sell them for minus a competitive spread. Also Zillow and=
=20
other algorithmic house-market-makers will be the main buyers and sellers=
=20
of houses; instead of hiring a realtor and putting out =E2=80=9CFor Sale=E2=
=80=9D signs and=20
baking cookies to attract buyers, you=E2=80=99ll just sell your house to Zi=
llow and=20
buy a new house from Zillow. And you won=E2=80=99t haggle over the price, b=
ecause=20

our new house=20
=E2=80=94 will just be *the *price.=20

But now we are in the early days of training that model and Zillow will som=
etimes=20

In particular it will sometimes get it wrong for a while, all in the same=
=20
direction. It will think =E2=80=9Chouse prices are going up=E2=80=9D and pa=

think =E2=80=9Coops house prices are going down=E2=80=9D and try to dump al=

I suppose the lesson here is that when Zillow is overbuying you should sell=
=20
them your house, and when they=E2=80=99re doing a fire sale you should try =
to buy=20
it back. I do hope that there are predatory high-frequency house traders=20

 should limit stablecoin issuance, and related activities of redemption and=
 maintenance of reserve assets, to entities that are insured depository ins=

s, insured depository institutions that issue stablecoins would be subject =
to supervision and regulation at the depository institution level by a fede=
ral banking agency and consolidated supervision and regulation by the Feder=

=E2=80=99s already receiving cars under its plan to add 100,000 Tesla elect=
ric vehicles through 2022, without responding directly to a market-moving t=
weet from billionaire Elon Musk that said there=E2=80=99s been no signed co=

 has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is invest=
ing in new EV charging infrastructure across the company=E2=80=99s global o=
perations,=E2=80=9D Hertz said in an emailed statement Tuesday. =E2=80=9CDe=
liveries of the Teslas already have started. We are seeing very strong earl=
y demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for T=
esla vehicles.=E2=80=9D ...</p><p style=3D"margin:16px 0px;font-family:Helv=
etica,Arial,sans-serif">In his Monday night tweet, Musk said that because T=
esla has demand for more vehicles than it can produce, the deal with Hertz =
=E2=80=9Chas zero effect on our economics.=E2=80=9D Tesla shares slumped as=
 much as 6.9% before the start of regular trading Tuesday, after soaring 56=
% during the past month to give the EV-maker a market valuation above $1 tr=
illion.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin:16px 0px;font-family:Helvetica,A=
rial,sans-serif">If your plan is to buy 100,000 Teslas when they become ava=
ilable and pay full retail price for them, you don=E2=80=99t actually need =
a signed contract? What you do is you go to Tesla=E2=80=99s website and cli=
ck on the model you want to buy and click =E2=80=9Corder now=E2=80=9D and i=
t will let you customize your car and give you an estimated delivery date.=
=C2=A0And you do that 100,000 times, and then you wait, and eventually you =
get 100,000 Teslas. Obviously this is not the=C2=A0<em style=3D"font-family=
:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">ideal=C2=A0</em>way to do it. If you sign a co=
rporate-level contract with Tesla, you=C2=A0only have to fill out the form =
once, instead of 100,000 times. But if the contract says =E2=80=9CTesla wil=
l deliver you your cars when it has filled the orders of everyone ahead of =
you in line, no promises on exactly when, and it will charge you the prices=
 on its website,=E2=80=9D then going to the website is a pretty close subst=
itute for signing a contract.[4]</p><p style=3D"margin:16px 0px;font-family=
:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">The basic fact here is that when Hertz announc=
ed that it was going to buy 100,000 Teslas, (1) its stock shot up and (2) T=
esla=E2=80=99s stock shot up. Tesla selling cars to Hertz is great for Tesl=
a and great for Hertz. If that keeps being true, you=C2=A0don=E2=80=99t rea=
lly need any discounts or commitments or enforcement mechanisms or indemnit=
ies or choice-of-law clauses or whatever. Hertz can just buy cars and Tesla=
 can just sell them.</p><p style=3D"margin:16px 0px;font-family:Helvetica,A=
