A few years ago, the hot thing in crypto was the =E2=80=9Cinitial coin offe=
ring.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0I could tell you a story in which initial coin offering=
s represented a truly new and interesting way to fund projects. Before ICOs=
 came along, projects =E2=80=94=C2=A0say, the development of a new internet=
 thing =E2=80=94=C2=A0might be funded by a corporation, which would then ow=
n the project and make a lot of money if it succeeded. Or they might be cre=
ated by volunteers in an open-source system, and then nobody would own the =
project or get rich. Or they might be funded by the government, which would=
 then control the project and give it away or whatever. But the ICO said: =
=E2=80=9CWe can fund projects with money from their potential users, and th=
en if the projects work out those=C2=A0users=C2=A0will get rich.=E2=80=9DTh=
is was an  interesting idea! One reason it=E2=80=99s interesting is  as a c=
ounterweight to the power of big tech companies: Instead of Facebook Inc. g=
etting huge amounts of money from the community it created, Future Facebook=
 could distribute those gains more broadly to the community. Another reason=
 it=E2=80=99s interesting, though, is for incentives. When corporations fun=
d projects, they hope to make money, so they fund projects that they think =
people will like. When users fund projects, hoping to get rich, the incenti=
ve to use the project is not=C2=A0just=C2=A0=E2=80=9Cthis is a useful thing=
 for me=E2=80=9D but also =E2=80=9Cif I use it I=E2=80=99ll get rich.=E2=80=
=9D It turns, like, file-storage systems into also Ponzi schemes: The commu=
nity of users is also a community of speculators. It=E2=80=99s weird but al=
so fun.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission looked at it and  didn=
=E2=80=99t like it, in part because a lot of it felt Ponzi-ish.=C2=A0And th=
eir reaction was to say, well, this is basically the same thing as a corpor=
ation selling stock. So we will treat it as a corporation selling stock, an=
d regulate ICOs as securities offerings. You will need to register the ICO =
with the SEC, and give investors audited financial statements, and generall=
y act like a corporation selling stock.=C2=A0But it wasn=E2=80=99t the same=
 thing as a corporation selling stock! I mean, look, it kind of was; a lot =
of ICOs were just corporations selling stock, but in scammier ways. But the=
=C2=A0core concept=C2=A0of the ICO was new and different; it was=C2=A0not=
=C2=A0a way for a corporation to fund a project that it would then own and =
profit from, but a way for a community to fund a project that no one would =
own and that its users could profit from. And by shoving it into the preexi=
sting concepts of securities law, the SEC sort of killed it. There is not, =
it turns out, a way for=C2=A0a community=C2=A0to fund a project that no one=
 would own and that its users could profit from, under U.S. law. Oh well.=
=C2=A0I don=E2=80=99t want to say that stablecoins are the hot new thing in=
 crypto now, or that they are a new and interesting way to do anything. A s=
tablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is supposed to always be worth a dollar.=
 There are various ways to do that. The main ones are a =E2=80=9Cbacked sta=
blecoin,=E2=80=9D where you sell stablecoins for $1, put the $1 in the bank=
, and stand willing to buy the stablecoins back with the $1, and an =E2=80=
=9Covercollateralized=C2=A0stablecoin,=E2=80=9D where you issue=C2=A0senior=
 claims on $20,000 worth of volatile crypto to support $10,000 of stablecoi=
ns.[1]=C2=A0There is nothing particularly new about these approaches. A bac=
ked stablecoin is something very close to a money-market mutual fund, in wh=
ich you take money from investors, put the money into safe short-term inter=
est-bearing investments, and promise to redeem the investors at $1. (Typica=
lly money-market funds pay interest and stablecoins don=E2=80=99t, which ma=
kes stablecoin issuing a good business to be in.) I  wrote once about a Fra=
nklin Templeton money-market fund that might one day live on the blockchain=
; what I wrote was that Franklin Templeton was =E2=80=9Claunching a stablec=
oin.=E2=80=9D Because that's what it is.An overcollateralized stablecoin, m=
eanwhile, is very close to a short-term (redeemable-on-demand)  senior clai=
m on a volatile asset or pool of assets. There are lots of things like that=
. The main short-term funding market in modern finance is the repo market, =
which consists basically of risk-free-ish overnight senior claims on bonds =
and other assets; those assets tend to be a lot less volatile than crypto b=
ut on the other hand the haircuts are smaller. Or there is =E2=80=94=C2=A0o=
r at least, was =E2=80=94=C2=A0asset-backed commercial paper, a form of sho=
rt-term, money-like obligations secured by a pool of mortgage-backed securi=
ties; this performed poorly in 2008, and ABCP, like CDO, became one of the =
bad initialisms of the financial crisis.All of these things =E2=80=94=C2=A0=
money-market funds, ABCP, even in a sense repo =E2=80=94=C2=A0are what can =
be loosely referred to as =E2=80=9Cshadow banking,=E2=80=9D which is to say=
, the issuing of money-like claims outside of the regulated banking system.=
 They exist basically because the banking system is heavily regulated =E2=
=80=94=C2=A0in particular there are capital requirements requiring banks to=
 have more assets than deposits=C2=A0=E2=80=94=C2=A0and some people would l=
ike to do banking-like activities without being subject to that regulation.=
 Obviously you can object to that! The term =E2=80=9Cshadow banking=E2=80=
=9D implies that it is objectionable. And there are smart people who argue =
that anyone issuing short-term money-like obligations should have to be a r=
egulated bank, that this sort of thing =E2=80=94=C2=A0allowing non-banks to=
 issue money =E2=80=94=C2=A0is the core problem of the modern financial sys=
tem. Still! It definitely happens. Money-market funds are very much a thing=
, more regulated now than they used to be but still not banks.=C2=A0How sho=
uld stablecoins be regulated? I don=E2=80=99t know. But here is the officia=
l position of=C2=A0basically all the U.S. financial regulators, in a report=
 from=C2=A0the President=E2=80=99s Working Group on Financial Markets:Legis=
lation should address the risks outlined in this report by establishing an =
appropriate federal prudential framework for payment stablecoin arrangement=
s. In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers, legislation should pr=
ovide for supervision on a consolidated basis; prudential standards; and, p=
otentially, access to appropriate components of the federal safety net. To =
accomplish these objectives, legislation should limit stablecoin issuance, =
and related activities of redemption and maintenance of reserve assets, to =
entities that are insured depository institutions. The legislation would pr=
ohibit other entities from issuing payment stablecoins. Legislation should =
also ensure that supervisors have authority to implement standards to promo=
te interoperability among stablecoins.Insured depository institutions inclu=
de both state and federally chartered banks and savings associations, the d=
eposits of which are covered, subject to legal limits, by deposit insurance=
, and which have access to emergency liquidity and Federal Reserve services=
. Like other insured depository institutions, insured depository institutio=
ns that issue stablecoins would be subject to supervision and regulation at=
 the depository institution level by a federal banking agency and consolida=
ted supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding compan=
y level. The standards to which these institutions are subject include capi=
tal and liquidity standards that are designed to address safety and soundne=
ss and, for the largest banking organizations, also include enhanced pruden=
tial standards that address financial stability concerns. Under the Federal=
 Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions also are subject to=
 a special resolution regime that enables the orderly resolution of failed =
insured depository institutions by, among other mechanisms, protecting cust=
omers=E2=80=99 insured deposits, and according priority to deposit claims o=
ver those of general creditors, and limits any potential negative systemic =
impacts in the event of bank failure.That just says that, if U.S. regulator=
s have their way, only banks will be allowed to issue stablecoins.[2] And t=
hey will be subject to capital and liquidity regulation and prudential over=
sight and stress testing and all the other regulatory apparatus of U.S. ban=
ks. You can read the report to see what the regulators are worried about; i=
t is all pretty straightforward stuff:Stablecoins and stablecoin-related ac=
tivities present a variety of risks. Speculative digital asset trading, whi=
ch may involve the use of stablecoins to move easily between digital asset =
platforms or in decentralized finance (DeFi) arrangements, presents risks r=
elated to market integrity and investor protection. These market integrity =
and investor protection risks encompass possible fraud and misconduct in di=
gital asset trading, including market manipulation, insider trading, and fr=
ont running, as well as a lack of trading or price transparency. Where thes=
e activities involve complex relationships or significant amounts of levera=
ge, there may also be risks to the broader financial system. =E2=80=A6Stabl=
ecoins also pose illicit finance concerns and risks to financial integrity,=
 including concerns related to compliance with rules governing anti-money l=
aundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and prolife=
ration. =E2=80=A6In addition to market integrity, investor protection, and =
illicit finance concerns, the potential for the increased use of stablecoin=
s as a means of payment raises a range of prudential concerns. If stablecoi=
n issuers do not honor a request to redeem a stablecoin, or if users lose c=
onfidence in a stablecoin issuer=E2=80=99s ability to honor such a request,=
 runs on the arrangement could occur that may result in harm to users and t=
he broader financial system. Further, to the extent stablecoins are widely =
used to facilitate payments, disruptions to the payment chain that allows s=
tablecoins to be transferred among users could lead to a loss of payments e=
fficiency and safety and undermine the functioning of the=C2=A0broader econ=
omy.=C2=A0I do not find these concerns particularly persuasive =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0non-stablecoins are at least as big of a fraud and illicit-finance probl=
em as stablecoins, and every day now there are huge crypto scams, runs and =
rug-pulls that seem to have no effect at all on the broader financial syste=
m =E2=80=94=C2=A0but a lot of people do and, you know, fine. They=E2=80=99r=
e real concerns, and they do argue for some regulation and oversight of sta=
blecoins.But what I want to emphasize here is that in the traditional finan=
cial system, people spend lots of time building =E2=80=9Cstablecoins=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=94=C2=A0in the sense of, dollar-deposit-like products =E2=80=94=
=C2=A0whose whole point is that they are not issued by insured depository i=
nstitutions. And when they do that, U.S. financial regulators mostly=C2=A0s=
ay =E2=80=9Caha, good one, you got us, you scamps,=E2=80=9D and propose mil=
d regulations to make those products a bit safer and less run-prone. They d=
o not say =E2=80=9Cwait, you are trying to make a product that is always wo=
rth a dollar, you've got to do that in a bank.=E2=80=9D[3] A certain amount=
 of experimentation is allowed.Perhaps that is terrible! Again, a lot of pe=
ople do legitimately think it=E2=80=99s terrible. Similarly, in crypto, hav=
ing many billions of dollars invested in  a thing that (1) is supposed to b=
e worth $1 in all circumstances, (2)  can=E2=80=99t say where it keeps its =
deposits=C2=A0and (3) has  essentially zero capital seems kind of bad! Perh=
aps it should disclose its assets and have capital and liquidity requiremen=
ts.But crypto is ... new? There is a lot of experimentation in crypto, a lo=
t of smart people trying to figure out the right way to do financial things=
 from a clean slate. (Also a lot of people trying to figure out how to do s=
cams; always that.) And it seems very strange to me that it should be subje=
ct to=C2=A0more=C2=A0traditional regulation than the traditional financial =
system, that experimentation in crypto should be=C2=A0harder=C2=A0than expe=
rimentation in traditional finance. If you are a mutual-fund company or a m=
ortgage REIT or whatever you can do shadow banking, but if you=E2=80=99re a=
 stablecoin issuer you can only do regular banking. That seems sort of back=
wards.

. Basically the moral of the story is that crypto makes irreversible transa=
ctions on a decentralized blockchain through immutable and auditable code, =
unless you complain a lot on Twitter, in which case the transactions will b=
e reversed on a somewhat arbitrary basis.One reading of this is: Ha ha ha. =
This defeats the whole purpose of crypto and NFTs and blockchains. Nobody c=
an trust the blockchain, nobody can trust that transfers on the blockchain =
are final, nobody can trust that they own the things that the blockchain sa=
ys they own.Another reading is: No, this is good. It is in general too easy=
 to trick crypto people out of their crypto, and that is=C2=A0bad, bad for =
the people who lose their crypto and also for confidence in and adoption of=
 the ecosystem. It is better for widely influential central parties, like e=
xchanges, to try to stop misbehavior and fix mistaken transfers. Everyone c=
an trust that they own what they own, unless they got it in bad ways, in wh=
ich case they=C2=A0shouldn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0be able to trust it.=C2=A0A third=
 reading would be: Something like this is good, but=C2=A0this=C2=A0mechanis=
m =E2=80=94=C2=A0being an influencer and complaining on Twitter and having =
some exchanges make ad hoc decisions to help you out =E2=80=94=C2=A0is not =
particularly good. You need a legal system, with trusted disinterested judg=
es and written rules and a system of precedent and due concern for the syst=
em as a whole.=C2=A0I like to say that crypto is about rapidly reliving all=
 of financial history, but that might understate things. This is the Bored =
Apes community discovering that you need=C2=A0law. This is a discovery that=
 it is actually nice to have a=C2=A0society. A trustless immutable decentra=
lized blockchain is nice, but it cannot completely replace a society with s=
ome trust.Elsewhere, here is a story about Bored Apes Yacht Club, the NFT p=
roject that made the Apes that this guy lost. It is a lot:Just last year, t=
he four thirtysomethings behind Bored Ape Yacht Club =E2=80=94 a collection=
 of 10,000 NFTs, which house cartoon primates and unlock the virtual world =
they live in =E2=80=94 were living modest lifestyles and working day jobs a=
s they fiddled with creative projects on the side. Now, they=E2=80=99re mul=
timillionaires who made it big off edgy, haphazardly constructed art pieces=
 that also act as membership cards to a decentralized community of madcaps.=
 What=E2=80=99s more punk rock than that? =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9CI always go bal=
ls to the wall,=E2=80=9D founding Ape Gordon Goner tells Rolling Stone over=
 Zoom. Everything about Goner, who could pass for a weathered 30 or a young=
 40, screams =E2=80=9Cfrontman,=E2=80=9D from his neck tattoo to his sturdy=
 physique to the dark circles under his eyes and his brazen attitude. He=E2=
=80=99s a risk taker: Back during his gambling-problem days, he admits he=
=E2=80=99d =E2=80=9Ckill it at the tables=E2=80=9D and then lose it all at =
the slot machines on the way to the car. =E2=80=A6Goner and his partners in=
 creative crime =E2=80=94 Gargamel, No Sass, and Emperor Tomato Ketchup =E2=
=80=94 were inspired by the communities of crypto lovers that have blossome=
d on platforms like Twitter in recent years. Clearly, people with this once=
-niche interest craved a destination to gather, discuss blockchain-related =
developments, and hurl the most inside of inside jokes. Why not, they thoug=
ht, give NFT collectors their own official home? And Bored Ape Yacht Club w=
as born.

      Hertz v. Tesla
   =20
 =20
Seems  fine?Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said it=E2=80=99s already receiving =
cars under its plan to add 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles through 2022, wi=
thout responding directly to a market-moving tweet from billionaire Elon Mu=
sk that said there=E2=80=99s been no signed contract between the companies =
yet. ...=E2=80=9CAs we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order=
 of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging inf=
rastructure across the company=E2=80=99s global operations,=E2=80=9D Hertz =
said in an emailed statement Tuesday. =E2=80=9CDeliveries of the Teslas alr=
eady have started. We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our=
 rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles.=E2=80=9D ..=
.In his Monday night tweet, Musk said that because Tesla has demand for mor=
e vehicles than it can produce, the deal with Hertz =E2=80=9Chas zero effec=
t on our economics.=E2=80=9D Tesla shares slumped as much as 6.9% before th=
e start of regular trading Tuesday, after soaring 56% during the past month=
 to give the EV-maker a market valuation above $1 trillion.If your plan is =
to buy 100,000 Teslas when they become available and pay full retail price =
for them, you don=E2=80=99t actually need a signed contract? What you do is=
 you go to Tesla=E2=80=99s website and click on the model you want to buy a=
nd click =E2=80=9Corder now=E2=80=9D and it will let you customize your car=
 and give you an estimated delivery date.=C2=A0And you do that 100,000 time=
s, and then you wait, and eventually you get 100,000 Teslas. Obviously this=
 is not the=C2=A0ideal=C2=A0way to do it. If you sign a corporate-level con=
tract with Tesla, you=C2=A0only have to fill out the form once, instead of =
100,000 times. But if the contract says =E2=80=9CTesla will deliver you you=
r cars when it has filled the orders of everyone ahead of you in line, no p=
romises on exactly when, and it will charge you the prices on its website,=
=E2=80=9D then going to the website is a pretty close substitute for signin=
g a contract.[4]The basic fact here is that when Hertz announced that it wa=
s going to buy 100,000 Teslas, (1) its stock shot up and (2) Tesla=E2=80=99=
s stock shot up. Tesla selling cars to Hertz is great for Tesla and great f=
or Hertz. If that keeps being true, you=C2=A0don=E2=80=99t really need any =
discounts or commitments or enforcement mechanisms or indemnities or choice=
-of-law clauses or whatever. Hertz can just buy cars and Tesla can just sel=
l them. Elsewhere:Avis Budget Group Inc. shares soared 218% to trade at its=
 highest level ever amid a flurry of retail crazed activity after it said i=
t will play a big role in the increased adoption of electric cars in the U.=
S.=C2=A0=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99ll see us going forward be much more active in=
 electric scenarios as the situation develops over time,=E2=80=9D Chief Exe=
cutive Officer Joe Ferraro told analysts on a call Tuesday.The stock more t=
han tripled to a record $545.11 in late morning trading in New York, bringi=
ng total gains for the year to a whopping 1,300%. The rapid jump in the sto=
ck price triggered at least 10 trading halts for volatility as 12 million s=
hares changed hands -- more than 20 times what=E2=80=99s been seen over the=
 past month. ...Avis didn=E2=80=99t disclose any plans to add EVs to its fl=
eet after rival Hertz Global Holdings Inc. agreed to buy 100,000 cars from =
Tesla Inc. But company executives said that doesn=E2=80=99t mean they aren=
=E2=80=99t pursuing potential deals for EVs.=C2=A0=E2=80=9CThe reason you h=
aven=E2=80=99t heard from us publicly is because for competitive reasons, w=
e like to execute on our strategy before announcing it,=E2=80=9D Chief Fina=
ncial Officer Brian Choi said on the call.Actually the weird part is that i=
t announced earnings yesterday after the close and they were good. It feels=
 somehow wrong for a company to go meme-stock=C2=A0on earnings. It=E2=80=99=
s supposed to be, like, the CEO puts a photo of a dog on his Instagram and =
everyone is like =E2=80=9CIT=E2=80=99S A SIGN THEY=E2=80=99RE BUYING SHIBA =
INU=E2=80=9D and the stock goes up 218%. If you announce earnings that beat=
 expectations due to strong customer demand, that=E2=80=99s a normal thing =
and your stock is supposed to go up a normal amount. Go up 10%, sure, why n=
ot, but 218% is for memes.I was also going to say that =E2=80=9Cwe like to =
execute on our strategy before announcing it=E2=80=9D is a singularly bad a=
pproach to the meme-stock era, and what you should actually do is announce =
your strategy a lot, have your stock go up, do a big stock offering, pay yo=
urself a huge bonus, buy some islands, and worry about execution later. But=
 I suppose Avis knows what it=E2=80=99s doing, judging by today=E2=80=99s s=
tock price.

      House block trade
   =20
 =20
Good time to  buy a house I guess:Zillow Group Inc. is looking to sell abou=
t 7,000 homes as it seeks to recover from a fumble in its high-tech home-fl=
ipping business.The company is seeking roughly $2.8 billion for the houses,=
 which are being pitched to institutional investors, according to people fa=
miliar with the matter. Zillow will likely sell the properties to a multitu=
de of buyers rather than packaging them in a single transaction, said the p=
eople, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. =E2=80=A6Th=
e move to offload homes comes as Zillow seeks to recover from an operationa=
l stumble that saw it buy too many houses, with many now being listed for l=
ess than it paid. The company typically offers smaller numbers of homes to =
single-family landlords, but the current sales effort is much larger than n=
ormal. =E2=80=A6An analysis of 650 homes owned by Zillow showed that two-th=
irds were priced for less than the company bought them for, according to an=
 Oct. 31 note from KeyBanc Capital Markets.=E2=80=9CI think they leaned int=
o home-price appreciation at exactly the wrong moment,=E2=80=9D said Ed Yru=
ma, an analyst at KeyBanc.=C2=A0You could have a model where in, like, 10 y=
ears, Zillow will be really really good at pricing houses, and it will alwa=
ys buy houses for exactly the price it can sell them for minus a competitiv=
e spread. Also Zillow and other algorithmic house-market-makers will be the=
 main buyers and sellers of houses; instead of hiring a realtor and putting=
 out =E2=80=9CFor Sale=E2=80=9D signs and baking cookies to attract buyers,=
 you=E2=80=99ll just sell your house to Zillow and buy a new house from Zil=
low. And you won=E2=80=99t haggle over the price, because Zillow=E2=80=99s =
market =E2=80=94=C2=A0its bid for your old house, its ask for your new hous=
e =E2=80=94=C2=A0will just be the price.=C2=A0But now we are in the early d=
ays of training that model and Zillow will  sometimes get it wrong. In part=
icular it will sometimes get it wrong for a while, all in the same directio=
n. It will think =E2=80=9Chouse prices are going up=E2=80=9D and pay a lot =
for thousands of houses, and then it won=E2=80=99t be able to sell them, an=
d it will think =E2=80=9Coops house prices are going down=E2=80=9D and try =
to dump all those houses quick in a fire sale.I suppose the lesson here is =
that when Zillow is overbuying you should sell them your house, and when th=
ey=E2=80=99re doing a fire sale you should try to buy it back. I do hope th=
at there are predatory high-frequency house traders getting low-latency dat=
a on Zillow=E2=80=99s order book and trying to front-run its trades.=C2=A0

Yesterday  I declared my intention to keep calling Facebook Facebook even t=
hough it is now named Meta Platforms Inc. One thing I said is that its stoc=

 it eventually to MVRS, for MetaVeRSe. I suppose that when that happens I w=
ill have a harder time calling it Facebook, though I may still give it a go=
. Perhaps it will one day give me some hipster cred; I=E2=80=99ll be in the=
 metaverse with my virtual-reality friends and I=E2=80=99ll be like =E2=80=

blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Legislation should address the risk=
s outlined in this report by establishing an appropriate federal prudential=
 framework for payment stablecoin arrangements. In particular, with respect=
 to stablecoin issuers, legislation should provide for supervision on a con=
solidated basis; prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropri=
ate components of the federal safety net. To accomplish these objectives, l=
egislation should limit stablecoin issuance, and related activities of rede=
mption and maintenance of reserve assets, to entities that are insured depo=
sitory institutions. The legislation would prohibit other entities from iss=
uing payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors h=
ave authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stab=
lecoins.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Insured depository institutions in=
clude both state and federally chartered banks and savings associations, th=
e deposits of which are covered, subject to legal limits, by deposit insura=
nce, and which have access to emergency liquidity and Federal Reserve servi=
ces. Like other insured depository institutions, insured depository institu=
tions that issue stablecoins would be subject to supervision and regulation=
 at the depository institution level by a federal banking agency and consol=
idated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding com=
pany level. The standards to which these institutions are subject include c=
apital and liquidity standards that are designed to address safety and soun=
dness and, for the largest banking organizations, also include enhanced pru=
dential standards that address financial stability concerns. Under the Fede=
ral Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions also are subject=
 to a special resolution regime that enables the orderly resolution of fail=
ed insured depository institutions by, among other mechanisms, protecting c=
ustomers=E2=80=99 insured deposits, and according priority to deposit claim=
s over those of general creditors, and limits any potential negative system=
ic impacts in the event of bank failure.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin=
: 16px 0;">That just says that, if U.S. regulators have their way, only ban=
ks will be allowed to issue stablecoins.[2] And they will be subject to cap=
ital and liquidity regulation and prudential oversight and stress testing a=
nd all the other regulatory apparatus of U.S. banks. You can read the repor=
t to see what the regulators are worried about; it is all pretty straightfo=
rward stuff:</p><blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Stablecoins and st=
ablecoin-related activities present a variety of risks. Speculative digital=
 asset trading, which may involve the use of stablecoins to move easily bet=
ween digital asset platforms or in decentralized finance (DeFi) arrangement=
s, presents risks related to market integrity and investor protection. Thes=
e market integrity and investor protection risks encompass possible fraud a=
nd misconduct in digital asset trading, including market manipulation, insi=
der trading, and front running, as well as a lack of trading or price trans=
parency. Where these activities involve complex relationships or significan=
t amounts of leverage, there may also be risks to the broader financial sys=
tem. =E2=80=A6</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Stablecoins also pose illici=
t finance concerns and risks to financial integrity, including concerns rel=
ated to compliance with rules governing anti-money laundering (AML) and cou=
ntering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and proliferation. =E2=80=A6</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">In addition to market integrity, investor protec=
tion, and illicit finance concerns, the potential for the increased use of =
stablecoins as a means of payment raises a range of prudential concerns. If=
 stablecoin issuers do not honor a request to redeem a stablecoin, or if us=
ers lose confidence in a stablecoin issuer=E2=80=99s ability to honor such =
a request, runs on the arrangement could occur that may result in harm to u=
sers and the broader financial system. Further, to the extent stablecoins a=
re widely used to facilitate payments, disruptions to the payment chain tha=
t allows stablecoins to be transferred among users could lead to a loss of =
payments efficiency and safety and undermine the functioning of the=C2=A0br=
oader economy.=C2=A0</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">I do not =
find these concerns particularly persuasive =E2=80=94=C2=A0<em>non</em>-sta=
blecoins are at least as big of a fraud and illicit-finance problem as stab=
lecoins, and every day now there are huge crypto scams, runs and rug-pulls =
that seem to have no effect at all on the broader financial system =E2=80=
=94=C2=A0but a lot of people do and, you know, fine. They=E2=80=99re real c=
oncerns, and they do argue for some regulation and oversight of stablecoins=

ngs Inc. said it=E2=80=99s already receiving cars under its plan to add 100=
,000 Tesla electric vehicles through 2022, without responding directly to a=
 market-moving tweet from billionaire Elon Musk that said there=E2=80=99s b=
een no signed contract between the companies yet. ...</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 16px 0;">=E2=80=9CAs we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial or=
der of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging =
infrastructure across the company=E2=80=99s global operations,=E2=80=9D Her=
tz said in an emailed statement Tuesday. =E2=80=9CDeliveries of the Teslas =
already have started. We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in =
our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles.=E2=80=9D=
 ...</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">In his Monday night tweet, Musk said t=
hat because Tesla has demand for more vehicles than it can produce, the dea=
l with Hertz =E2=80=9Chas zero effect on our economics.=E2=80=9D Tesla shar=
es slumped as much as 6.9% before the start of regular trading Tuesday, aft=
er soaring 56% during the past month to give the EV-maker a market valuatio=
n above $1 trillion.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">If your p=
lan is to buy 100,000 Teslas when they become available and pay full retail=
 price for them, you don=E2=80=99t actually need a signed contract? What yo=
u do is you go to Tesla=E2=80=99s website and click on the model you want t=
o buy and click =E2=80=9Corder now=E2=80=9D and it will let you customize y=
our car and give you an estimated delivery date.=C2=A0And you do that 100,0=
00 times, and then you wait, and eventually you get 100,000 Teslas. Obvious=
ly this is not the=C2=A0<em>ideal=C2=A0</em>way to do it. If you sign a cor=
porate-level contract with Tesla, you=C2=A0only have to fill out the form o=
nce, instead of 100,000 times. But if the contract says =E2=80=9CTesla will=
 deliver you your cars when it has filled the orders of everyone ahead of y=
ou in line, no promises on exactly when, and it will charge you the prices =
on its website,=E2=80=9D then going to the website is a pretty close substi=
tute for signing a contract.[4]</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The basic f=
act here is that when Hertz announced that it was going to buy 100,000 Tesl=
as, (1) its stock shot up and (2) Tesla=E2=80=99s stock shot up. Tesla sell=
ing cars to Hertz is great for Tesla and great for Hertz. If that keeps bei=
ng true, you=C2=A0don=E2=80=99t really need any discounts or commitments or=
 enforcement mechanisms or indemnities or choice-of-law clauses or whatever=
. Hertz can just buy cars and Tesla can just sell them.</p><p style=3D"marg=

ecover from a fumble in its high-tech home-flipping business.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The company is seeking roughly $2.8 billion for the ho=
uses, which are being pitched to institutional investors, according to peop=
le familiar with the matter. Zillow will likely sell the properties to a mu=
ltitude of buyers rather than packaging them in a single transaction, said =
the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. =E2=80=
=A6</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The move to offload homes comes as Zill=
ow seeks to recover from an operational stumble that saw it buy too many ho=
uses, with many now being listed for less than it paid. The company typical=
ly offers smaller numbers of homes to single-family landlords, but the curr=
ent sales effort is much larger than normal. =E2=80=A6</p><p style=3D"margi=

 were priced for less than the company bought them for, according to an Oct=

ears, Zillow will be really really good at pricing houses, and it will alwa=
ys buy houses for exactly the price it can sell them for minus a competitiv=
e spread. Also Zillow and other algorithmic house-market-makers will be the=
 main buyers and sellers of houses; instead of hiring a realtor and putting=
 out =E2=80=9CFor Sale=E2=80=9D signs and baking cookies to attract buyers,=
 you=E2=80=99ll just sell your house to Zillow and buy a new house from Zil=
low. And you won=E2=80=99t haggle over the price, because Zillow=E2=80=99s =
