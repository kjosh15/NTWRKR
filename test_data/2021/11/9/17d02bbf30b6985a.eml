Joshua,

Sorry to be so late here. I read it when you sent it and thought I had 
answered it. There's $s to be made with premium wines, but it can be 
VERY tricky. Bill Fuller had a neighbor who bought e 3-bottle wooden 
case of Eagle Crest every year for ~$1500. never drank a bottle for many 
years. He would hold the box for a few years and sell it for $2500 to 
$3000. FWIW, Bill finally talked him into trying a bottle.

Note also that this is an individual purchase and sale. Also, several 
years ago here was a giant scandal where someone forged labels, filled 
bottles with his own contrived blend and sold them as these sorts of 
"collectors" wines.

To be safe, when you make your (first) millions, buy wines to drink - 
that's what the winemaker would want.

Love,

DAD
