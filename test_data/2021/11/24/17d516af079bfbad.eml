I spoke with Nikul=C3=A1s in NY (the consulate), and also Sigur=C3=B0ur Mar=
k=C3=BAsson at
Landsvirkjun yesterday; excellent insights with both, especially around
foreign capital and the positioning of Iceland. I'm also due to talk to
EIMUR here in Akureyri next week.

Let me know if a followup conversation would be useful to you, otherwise
I'll be reconnecting with all of the above in the new year to see how we
can get more traction - just wanted to update you in case there's anywhere
I can add value.

All best to you and yours,
Josh

P.S., the Icelandverse video hit my inbox roughly 1,000 times over the last
couple weeks - was that your doing? If so, nicely done!!
