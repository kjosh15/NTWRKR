Totally understand and am completely on board - BFC is a big priority for
me too! Let me know how I can help secure this; I=E2=80=99ve loved working =
with
your team.

Reg. Discover, I=E2=80=99ll keep after the CMO to have a call (possibly aft=
er the
holidays) and see where we land, but in the meantime will aim not to rock
the boat until everything is steady. Keep me posted.

All best,
Josh
