Damn, I fell really far behind here. Shit. I didn't know you had torn
styrene. That's going to be a problem. I would check and see if I have any
precut spares but my shop is ALL packed up because of the freaking drywall
renovation. It gets painted Dec.13 and after that I can start unpacking. So
I'm fucked at the moment.

I should have some time after Thanksgiving to do a call or video call if
you wanna shoot me some dates or times, or that link to your schedule where
I can just grab a slot.

Apologies, it's been pretty rough here lately. Hope you and your family are
well!

-Steve
