Good connecting with you yesterday; good to hear you're settled, doing the
work, and living the life you're after.

Let me know if an intro to your former Accenture friend still works; I'd
love to hear what they have to say about our approach to M&A with the Big
4.

Many thanks, and happy holidays to you and yours!
- Josh
