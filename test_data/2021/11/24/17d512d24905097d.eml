Makes sense. I'll see if I can't see anything while I'm in town today;
price range ~$20?

Also, you sent the receipt from Bastet's vet bill. Was that intended for us
to pay? Happy to discuss if you'd like to talk it over, but didn't want to
ignore it if there was that expectation!

xoxo,
Josh

What do you think about this as a gift for the folks? Interview them and ge=
t a professionally produced podcast of their story together. It=E2=80=99s a=
 little pricey, but if we call it a gift from all three of us maybe=E2=80=

 really like the idea of someone else pulling out a narrative (and making i=
