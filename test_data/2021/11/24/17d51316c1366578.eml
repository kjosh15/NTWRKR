FYI, I'm setting up a call with him directly now. Let me know if you have
any questions or concerns you'd like me to address. At the moment my main
goal is to get clarity on his intentions for the data, how he'll deal with
privacy and support, and how he'd like to brand it relative to our existing
efforts.

All best,
Josh

Hi Josh! Glad you like the site so far, I'd love to meet up over a call to
walk you through the work I've done so far. I realise that I may have
glossed over it in the video, but the site also offers the user to check
out Public Data (i.e. the number of coins deposited and crows that have
landed on the perch per country/location). I've been getting feedback from
some other users (who have not built a Crowbox) and they suggested making
the Public Data accessible to everyone (even those who have not created an
account). So currently I am in the process of building a 3D globe with bar
charts showing the data per country (for non authenticated users to view).

I plan on introducing methods for users who wish to operate offline to
upload their data as well (through an SD card). It would also be great for
users with cameras to have their footage uploaded (with their permission)
to their page. Maybe build something like a social media profile where
everyone can share their data and images/videos of the crowboxes being
used.

My work email is hq17616@bristol.ac.uk and my personal email is
qureshi.a.hamza@gmail.com. Feel free to email me so we can set something
up! Alternatively, we could open the meeting up to anyone else in the
community who would like to join and offer their insights. The more the
merrier.
