=EF=BB=BFHi Joel,

Below are Xmas traditions to be forwarded to Josh.  Please make corrections
and forward to Josh and me (for our records).  Thanks.

Food:
Use Apricot Crescent and/or Stollen for Xmas morning
Drink champagne Xmas eve as we wrapped Xmas presents and prepared for Xmas =
-
This started the 1st year we were married. W3 spent Christmas Eve at home
before going to Davis the next morning. Your mother made the ornament we
still use atop the tree and we wrapped presents. I had gotten a case of
wine at work as a Christmas gift and there wa# a bottle of champagne
included. When midnight came we were fading so we decide$ to have some
champagne as a pick-me-up. Been doing it every year since.
Special Mark Twain egg nog party before Xmas. The recipe is in the book
Hulda=E2=80=99s grandmother rebound for us. Can send a copy if wanted - bew=
are!
It=E2=80=99s potent.
Apple and pumpkin pies with whipped cream. Always at least these 2. That
is, except when there is just the 2 of us.
Xmas dinner - glazed onions/homemade cranberry relish/Brussels
sprouts/turnips

Activities:
Frequently put salami in your stocking so Santa could deliver it to you.
This is something that you loved and we did it for several years.
Always used real tree
Used family heirloom ornaments - among the newer ones.
Read =E2=80=9CThe Gift of the Magi=E2=80=9D Xmas eve
Always placed Xmas wreath I made years ago over the fireplace
Gave books to you and Devon every year.  This is a carry-over from my
childhood.
Gave books not money
Always painted kitchen window with Xmas theme.

Hope this gives you some of the ways we celebrated Xmas.

Love,

Dad and Mom
