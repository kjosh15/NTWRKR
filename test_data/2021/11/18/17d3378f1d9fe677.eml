Hey Josh,

Again, big apologies for the slow response. We landed a end-of-year gig
with Apple that has been absorbing every free minute of mine.

Another reason I'm slow on the stock stuff is that we're currently going
through a rebrand and launching in early December, so I don't have all my
stock templates built yet. Excuses, but real. Ha! That being said, if you
want to draft a loose idea of what they're looking for I can help fill in
the gaps, I just don't currently have the team size to pull off a proposal
from scratch with the new branding before end of year. I do want to take
advantage of the audience you currently have with Discover.

Regarding our work together, my big priority is to push forward with New
York Times and Accenture. We have a captive audience, a great team and a
solid workflow. I think we can continue to accomplish great things together
on Built for Change.

Best,

Andy
