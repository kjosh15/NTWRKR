Huge congrats on Apple!! And no worries on the delay, I understand business
prioritization!

For Discover, do you have an old template I could use to start with? I
really don=E2=80=99t know what the right approach is here and they clearly =
want
something boilerplate. Otherwise I=E2=80=99ll push the CMO for a direct cal=
l and
see if I can get traction that way.

Finally, I hear you on New York Times and Accenture. Do you have any ideas
on expanding that, or are you thinking more =E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t mess wit=
h a good thing?=E2=80=9D

All best,
Josh
