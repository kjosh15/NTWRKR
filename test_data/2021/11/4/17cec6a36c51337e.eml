The executive I spoke to was really keen, but this team seems to be more of
the hoop-jumping variety. I=E2=80=99d say a standardized proposal to get th=
em
something to approve while I push vision at the more senior level would
work best. Do you have something stock we can tweak to submit?

Reg. timeline, the sooner we get something in the more likely they=E2=80=99=
ll be
make a decision instead of pushing off post-holidays.

How can I help?
