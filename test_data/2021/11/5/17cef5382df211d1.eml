*TL;DR: What do we need to know to best prepare for M&A?*
Despite slow growth throughout Q3 and 4, we are seeing bigger and bigger
conversations with potential partners, clients, and potential acquirers.

This is a double edged sword situation; our staff is still very small (5
people including myself and my cofounder) and our tech stack is still
lagging (although we HAVE proven it can scale!) But larger and larger
possibilities have presented themselves;

- A potential engagement measuring DE&I behaviors in 1600 boards
- Interest by Red Bird Capital in using it for sports teams (starting with
Manchester United)
- Appetite by Lego, Adidas, VCF, and others
- An initial deployment by a Scottish accounting firm to use us for IQSM,
the big new regulation for auditing orgs hitting the UK December 2022 (with
an intro as solution to the other 600 firms in their network)

And of course ongoing conversations with EY, KPMG, Accenture, McKinsey, and
Deloitte - one of which just asked if we were for sale.

All of which is to say that I'm as nervous as a freshman at the homecoming
dance. This (hopefully) won't be the first invitation to discuss
acquisition that we get, but my intuition is that if we're going to sell at
above our logical valuation (we're still only clearing $.5mm ARR) it's
going to be on the back of a Big Ass Story. Fortunately I'm good at those.

The questions preceding that are, however, significant:

1) What materially do we need to do to maximize our M&A invitation size
(i.e. staff, tech stack, process/procedures, etc.)?
2) What kind of story is most appealing, and to which target (i.e.,
consultancies, large funds like Red Bird, PE, etc.?)
3) How do you create a perfect storm of FOMO and Market Leading Insights
(tm) to drive appetite to create a bidding war?

These may be outside your specific expertise, but I bet you have some
experience and/or know someone who does. We're way out ahead of our skis
here and although we seem to be heading in the right direction I'd hate to
tumble with the finish line in sight. Any help is appreciated!!

Gratefully,
Josh

going from a $1 to a $4.7bn valuation in the last six months... and we
think our data is far superior.
