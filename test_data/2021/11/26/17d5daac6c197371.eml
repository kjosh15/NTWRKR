I mean, we can use a live video to view the crowbox, like "What happened to=

i Josh! Glad you like the site so far, I&#39;d love to meet up over a call =
to walk you through the work I&#39;ve done so far. I realise that I may hav=
e glossed over it in the video, but the site also offers the user to check =
out Public Data (i.e. the number of coins deposited and crows that have lan=
ded on the perch per country/location). I&#39;ve been getting feedback from=
 some other users (who have not built a Crowbox) and they suggested making =
the Public Data accessible to everyone (even those who have not created an =
account). So currently I am in the process of building a 3D globe with bar =
charts showing the data per country (for non authenticated users to view).=
=C2=A0<div><br></div><div>I plan on introducing methods for users who wish =
to operate offline to upload their data as well (through an SD card). It wo=
uld also be great for users with cameras to have their footage uploaded (wi=
th their permission) to their page. Maybe build something like a social med=
ia profile where everyone can share their data and images/videos of the cro=
wboxes being used.=C2=A0<br><div><br></div><div>My work email is <a rel=3D"=
