No apologies necessary; if things are rough do what needs doing, first!
I'll still be here.

That said, if you've got the time my cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling=

Otherwise I'll ping you again before the end of the year - again, if you've
got personal stuff going on that's priority!

All best to you and yours,
Josh
