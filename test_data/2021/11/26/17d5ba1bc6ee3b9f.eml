Subject: Re: [PREP] Round Table Interview Next Tuesday 11/30

I read the whole doc and just wanted to confirm that I can go
broad-ranging; in the past timelines have been so tight I've felt like I
need to stick pretty close to the questions. If you're willing to use Slack
to push me on anything you feel I'm missing I'll try to follow the natural
conversation more closely while hitting the highlights. Sound good?
