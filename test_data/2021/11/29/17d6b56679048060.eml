<div><font size=3D"2"><span style=3D"font-size:11pt">
<div>Hi Devon,=C2=A0<br>
<br>
I received Bastet&#39;s lab work results, which are attached. Her=C2=A0red =
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are normal.=C2=A0Bastet&#39;s=
 glucose, proteins, and liver values are normal.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, her=C2=A0kidney values are elevated (SDMA, creatinine, and B=
UN) indicating kidney disease. This is what&#39;s causing her increased dri=
nking and urination. I attached a chart below that shows how we classify th=
e stages of kidney disease based on creatinine
 level. Bastet is in stage 2 kidney disease (1 being the earliest and 4 bei=
ng the latest stage).=C2=A0Kidney disease is a common degenerative process =
in older pets. It can=E2=80=99t be reversed, but there are a few things we =
can do to slow it down.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
Firstly, we can start Bastet on a kidney friendly diet. We have Royal Canin=
 Renal Support=C2=A0in stock, we can also send you with a written prescript=
ion for either that diet or the Hill&#39;s k/d (kidney diet) if you&#39;d p=
refer.=C2=A0You can start mixing the kidney diet with
 her=C2=A0current=C2=A0food to transition her=C2=A0to the new diet over a w=
eek. I also recommend starting all cats with kidney disease=C2=A0on a chewa=
ble supplement called Renal Essentials, I will paste=C2=A0more information =
on that below.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
Bastet&#39;s electrolytes are being affected by her kidney disease. I recom=
mend we start her on a potassium supplement called renal K which is a flavo=
red gel. We have this at the clinic. A lot of cats will eat the gel like a =
treat or will lick it off their front
 arms if you place it there. If you don&#39;t think she&#39;ll go for the g=
el we can set you up with a potassium powder to mix in her food via our onl=
ine pharmacy.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
We should encourage her=C2=A0water drinking, you can even try getting a cat=
 water fountain. The more water she drinks, the better she will feel as it =
will help flush out the toxins that are getting backed up in her blood stre=
am due to her=C2=A0kidney disease.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
For cats with kidney disease, we recommend checking a urine culture and sen=
sitivity.=C2=A0First of all, this is to make sure there is no kidney infect=
ion causing the kidney disease. If it were positive, we would treat her=C2=
=A0with an antibiotic. Secondly, cats with
 kidney disease have more dilute urine and are more prone to urinary tract =
infections. This could cause inappropriate urination. It&#39;s more difficu=
lt to detect UTIs in cats with kidney disease based on the basic urinalysis=
 alone, because their urine is so dilute.
 This test costs $142. This follow up test could be set up as a nurse appoi=
ntment for sterile urine collection and would not require=C2=A0another doct=
or=E2=80=99s appointment.<br>
<br>
Other than Bastet&#39;s urine being dilute due to kidney disease her=C2=A0u=
rine looks normal. There&#39;s a borderline amount of protein in his urine =
but not too much right now. Protein leakage can be a problem with kidney di=
sease so we will continue to monitor this going
 forward.<br>
<br>
Bastet&#39;s thyroid level is in the &#39;grey zone&#39; for older cats whe=
re it could be becoming high, but is currently within the normal range. I r=
ecommend we monitor this along with her kidney values and urine at least ev=
ery 6 months going forward. Some cats require
 treatment for an overactive thyroid as they age.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
Feel free to submit a fecal sample in the next couple weeks to complete thi=
s panel.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any questions. Feel free to schedule the follow up =
nurse visit and let us know if you&#39;d like the diet and/or supplements s=
ent home for Bastet at that time.=C2=A0<br>

<br>
RENAL ESSENTIALS CHEWS:<br>
<br>
This is a supplement that comes in the form of a treat. It is an herbal sup=
plement that supports the kidneys. The chews=C2=A0help maintain proper kidn=
ey function by supporting renal circulation, normal fluid retention, normal=
 detoxification, stress management, homocysteine
 balance, and kidney and liver function. These can be picked up at the clin=
ic.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
WHAT TO MONITOR AT HOME:<br>
<br>
The number one most important factor in how well your cat=C2=A0does long te=
rm with kidney disease=C2=A0is weight. It&#39;s extremely important that we=
 monitor for=C2=A0weight loss, never limit how much she=C2=A0can eat and re=
peat testing if we have more than 10% weight loss. You might
 consider buying a baby scale on amazon and weighing monthly at home. If yo=
u do, please email us those weights so they can be added to the=C2=A0weight=
 chart (info@columbiacity.vet)<br>
<br>
Cats with kidney disease=C2=A0will forever drink a large quantity and produ=
ce an increased amount of urine. This is the=C2=A0body&#39;s attempt to do =
it&#39;s own dialysis, which helps kitties with this disease not feel the e=
ffects of chronic renal failure. Please never limit
 how much water your pet can have. Water drinking should be encouraged,=C2=
=A0you can even try buying a pet water fountain.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
MONITORING AT THE VET:<br>
<br>
Sometimes things can change quickly for kitties with chronic kidney disease=
. Their kidney disease can become suddenly worse or they can develop additi=
onal diseases or conditions which compromise their health. Therefore, we re=
commend an exam and lab work at
 least every 6-12 months depending on how they=E2=80=99re doing.=C2=A0<br>
