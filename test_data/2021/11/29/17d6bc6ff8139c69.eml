Just checking in to see how ya'll are doing and to ask if you have a
personal tax attorney you'd recommend. We're getting our first initial
inquiries around M&A and I'm keen to figure out who I want to work with
when/if things progress. Any recommendations?

Otherwise let me know if you'd like to catch up some time; I'm keen to get
an update on Clay, and to hear what new things are consuming your cycles
these days. There's so much great new tech getting built!!

All best and gratefully,
Josh
