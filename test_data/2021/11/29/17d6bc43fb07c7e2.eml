Simon,

My current startup <http://indigometrics.com> is now being approached reg.
JV and M&A by all of the big 4, and I'm in need of a capable lawyer to help
us with paperwork ahead of when it's critical. Do you have any
recommendations on someone capable who might have a startup pricing
function?

Otherwise I hope you and yours are thriving despite all the madness in the
world at large; I'd love an update when you get a chance!

Gratefully,
Josh
