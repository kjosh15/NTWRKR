John,

Thanks again for the call the other day; I just caught up with Tim and it
sounds like working directly with you to shape our agreements with large
consultancies may be the highest impact next step.

To move forward, I'd like to set up a call with yourself and my cofounder
so he can meet you and we can both review what you see as next steps, as
well as to discuss pricing. As an early stage company we're hopeful we can
set up something appropriate and are excited to see what we can do together=
!

Let me know how the next couple weeks in the morning looks for you (we're
both GMT ATM) for a call.

Gratefully,
Josh
