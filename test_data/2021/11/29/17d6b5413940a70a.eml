Love it! Although I can guess, I'll be curious to hear why you want to buy
a company instead of trying to build out internally.

Happy to help with targeting, but my impression at the outset is that it's
a sellers market and everyone is buying - i.e., I don't have any teams off
the top of my head that I can introduce you to, although obvs. there are
several sources we can start conversations with. I've been building network
here in the EU so we may have better leads to start with locally if you are
looking for geolocal. Talk to you on the 8th!!
