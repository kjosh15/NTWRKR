Laura,

Let me know what I can do to help move this forward. We've been building on
our KPI correlations and are targeting a 190,000 employee rollout early
next year to further substantiate our findings on improving KPIs through
value-led interventions (to simultaneously reduce churn and improve
recruitment). If that data doesn't make you curious, it looks like we'll
also be building a completely new values alignment protocol for a new R&D
division in one of the top three global sports brands... and we have some
interesting new data on gender bias!

I.e., really do let me know what I can do to help move things with Wharton
forward! We're keen to work with you. :)

All best,
Josh
