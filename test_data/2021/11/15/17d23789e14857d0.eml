Thanks, John - it really does look like the right place, but I'm concerned
that we're spinning our wheels. I've got a few case studies that might
help, one of which shows how we're operationalizing corporate value by
correlating KPIs and behaviors in a major (~90k) call center operation.

I know that's a market PwC must be looking at; is there anyone elsewhere in
the org who might be interested in talking about how to use unique
metrics + software to create immediate impact in the space? (Alternatively,
I can talk similarly to DE&I and Retention.)

Just trying to find the best way to get something moving with PwC; we're
getting a lot of interest from Deloitte, EY, and Accenture right now but I
still think PwC has a lot of potential to scale our tool.

All best,
Josh
