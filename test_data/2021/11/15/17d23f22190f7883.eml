Emma,

I wanted to loop back around to see if we could connect prior to the new
year. Things in your world must be hopping right now, and I think I've got
some interesting new data to throw fuel on the fire with!

We've just finished a large case study (~6,000 employees) into the
correlation between our behavior data and KPIs in a large call center,
enabling our client to operationalize behavior-driven actions across the
entire organization. This is improving KPIs while simultaneously improving
retention, reducing churn, and increasing recruitment outcomes.

Essentially it is a true "P&L of Culture" across the organization, built
from and driven by its values first, and allowing for emergent behaviors to
maximize KPIs (i.e., human-first and innovation optimized). It's a pretty
drastic shift in perspective for the HCM function, but it's driving a lot
of attention (discussions with all of the Big 4, and three new large
multinationals looking to onboard this quarter.)

I'd love to present some of our findings and discuss how this more
statistically driven approach to HCM might be relevant to your members.-
we're already seeing best practices emerge that are miles apart from
standard operating procedures for most large multinationals.

Let me know if a brief call in the coming weeks is possible; my calendar is
here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or please suggest something that works
for you GMT!

All best,
Josh
