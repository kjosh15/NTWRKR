Two questions for you:

1. What would it take to get a price + time estimate to rebuild this produc=
t
<http://indigometrics.com>? (We may need a complete rewrite prior to M&A

2. Where the hell do you order weight plates for dumbbells in this country?
I only tried Bland.is and it's a nightmare.

All best,
Josh
