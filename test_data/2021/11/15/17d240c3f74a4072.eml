Been trying to leave you alone as I suspect you have plenty on your plate,
but recently spoke to Tom Waller and Heinrich and figured there was plenty
to discuss. Nothing critical, but if you have time and interest would be
happy to connect before the new year!

My cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, suggest something that works
for you GMT, or delete this email and I'll ping you again in a couple
months. ;)

All best,
Josh
