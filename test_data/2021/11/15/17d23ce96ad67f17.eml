Susan,

Wanted to follow up on this as we just finished a pretty amazing case study
correlating our behavior metrics to KPIs. This allows us to predictively
reduce churn, increase retention, and improve recruitment outcomes while
improving KPI performance algorithmically and at scale. I'd love to share
it with you!

More interestingly (given your work), it means that being able to lead with
values can now be mapped all the way down to individually-driven behavior
priorities, which are then connected to the KPIs which produce the biggest
outcomes on a division, group, and individual level. I.e., *a P&L of
Culture is now available*.

Let me know if a follow up call is possible; we're getting a ton of
interest (a 190,000 employee deployment with one, and a 62,00 employee
engagement with another of your competitors) and I'd really like your view
on our metrics with an eye on how the board can use this. If the board
isn't leading with a solid understanding of how to metric and manage
culture there are increasing levels - and whole new types - of risk quickly
evolving that quarterly-focused leadership aren't in a position to guard
against.

Let me know if you have time for a call anytime here
<http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest something GMT!

All best,
Josh
