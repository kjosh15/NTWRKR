Sorry for the shortened call, and as usual a blast catching up with you!!
Let me know if you can think of any places that might find Indigometrics
useful, and/or if there's anything else I can do to help with your
current projects. For example, where/how can I best be of help with the
book? Is there a place to submit reviews for a publication like this?

Separately, let's touch base in a month or two to catch up in more depth -
I should have (even) more data then!!
