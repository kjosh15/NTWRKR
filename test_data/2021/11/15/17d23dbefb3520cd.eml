Let me know if you have time for a call before the end of the year; we've
just finished a large (~6,000 employee) case study into the
correlation between our behavior data and KPIs in large call centers that
might be relevant. We can now operationalize behavior-driven actions across
the entire organization, improving KPIs while simultaneously improving
retention, reducing churn, and increasing recruitment outcomes. Given your
interests at Estee this seems pertinent, as it allows for a true "P&L of
Culture" across the organization, built from its values.

Let me know if a brief call in the coming weeks is possible; my calendar is
here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or please suggest something that works
for you GMT!
