Hey, do you have a recommendation on a good dev shop? We have a fairly
simple AWS-based survey platform with some gnarly python-coded
algorithms processing the data on the back end, and we may need to
(quickly) rebuild the whole thing into one unified platform for M&A. I'd
need solid SLAs, quick turnaround time, and oh yeah! Cheap too, please. ;D

Any suggestions appreciated; hit me with an update on your latest gig while
you're at it!!

All best,
Josh
