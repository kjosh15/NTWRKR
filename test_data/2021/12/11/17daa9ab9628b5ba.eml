All I know is that the lawyer I just met is working directly with Norton
and expressed (in confidence) that they're working on an EV Bike. He
pointed out that it was easy to infer that they would be; I'd take that
route in your letter.

This lawyer is looking for my business, and I haven't worked for him
before, but when I explained about you and your interest in the space he
said that if I could get a letter to him he'd get it on to Robert
Hentschel's desk. He's the CEO AFAIK.

That's all I got for you - this guy could be completely blowing smoke at me
to try to make me a customer, or he could be privy to internal
conversations indicating that they really need some original marketing
around their new EV. I don't know, but I'm happy to pass a letter to him as
soon as you write it!

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help,
Josh
