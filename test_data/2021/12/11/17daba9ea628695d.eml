That sounds fantastic and I really appreciate it. I will keep that in mind
and once the dissertation is over, I will let you know!

Regarding the project, I have a few updates. I was only able to briefly
meet with my supervisor, but the gist of it was that they were unsure where
the project will go next. They had previously discussed working on
implementing an AI Imaging system to identify crows and other corvids. They
also had a couple of other ideas, none of which were originally in line
with the creation of the data collection and sharing website (though I
imagine that may change now). I do not think it is necessary for another
student to come on board (though it would be great - the more the
merrier!), and I am sure that upon completing the dissertation I will have
permission to continue working on the project and open it up entirely to
the CrowBox community i.e. making the GitHub repository public.

Regarding the website, it has gone through a few minor changes since we
last met. I am currently in the process of making the site responsive and
so far it has been a success. The main data page can now be used on any
device (I imagine most users would prefer to check their data and change
the training phase on their phones). The site can now also assess whether
or not the NodeMCU ESP32 (or any microcontroller for that matter) is
connected to the WiFi.

The last few things I plan on implementing are:
- A fail-safe for the Servo and the Sliding Lid
- Developing new CAD designs for the front panel, roof panel and back panel
to provide access to the troubleshoot sensors (to check the amount of food
left, amount of coins left in the dispenser and a slot for the SD card
access if users wish to operate offline).

Kind regards,
