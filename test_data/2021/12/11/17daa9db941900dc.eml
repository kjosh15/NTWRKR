It depends on where the content is - usually in an /HTML folder, but might
also be a /website folder. If you can get me a top level directory list I
can dig down for you - the main thing is you don't want to copy a ton of
webserver files you don't need and can't control!

Love,
Josh

When I called HostMySite yesterday for a bit of guidance to ftp to the site=

not really fixed. At least now I can FTP to the site. Do I copy everything =

Let me know what time(s) work for you tomorrow. <br>
