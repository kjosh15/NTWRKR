Dad,

I couldn't connect - it says "this server won't allow any additional users
to log on. Contact your systems administrator."

Do you know if we can connect via SSH or SFTP? (Would require a different
account - I tried both at that IP and was refuted.) FTP is depreciated on
basically everything now in any case.

Xoxo,
Josh
