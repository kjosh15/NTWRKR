An interesting, in-depth read, but the big takeaways for me are:

1. We should buy a boatload of tests as they=E2=80=99re going to be very har=
d to find pretty soon. (Big point of the article is that nobody is planning f=
or what will absolutely happen very soon, which is an explosion of cases tha=
t potentially overwhelm our healthcare systems.)

2. We should consider whether we want to take the kids out of school before t=
hey get vaccinated. (Not trying to be hyperbolic here, but omikron is going t=
o become ubiquitous very fast.)

3. Might be worth stocking up on whatever we need to stock up on in case thi=
s causes further supply chain shortages in the mid-long term. I.e., contacts=
, clothing, food, sports stuff, drawing paper - the stuff that makes us bein=
g separated from the world more awesome.
