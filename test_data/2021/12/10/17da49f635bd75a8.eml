Norton's head lawyer and I just had a chat - he was rec'd as being able to
help us with our UK paperwork in looking at M&A - and he mentioned
confidentially that Norton is, like everyone, looking to do an EV Bike. I
told him about your work and he said that if you could get him a general
interest letter he'd get it on Robert Hentschel's desk. (I.e., let him know
you suspect they're doing EVs and would like to propose working with them.)

Does that help?
