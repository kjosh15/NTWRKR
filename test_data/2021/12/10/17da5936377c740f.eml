Thanks for this.  I forwarded to the CEO of Mucho. Mucho is the =
international agency, rather than Social Blueprint, the local one, for =
whom I=E2=80=99ve been doing a lot of naming and marketing. Because =
I=E2=80=99ve been swamped with the naming/marketing at a start-up =
behavioral health company, Mucho and I haven=E2=80=99t worked on =
anything serious in a few months so we=E2=80=99re both interested in =
finding something juicy. This could be it.  Norton is one of the =
original motorcycles (I think the brand is over 120 yrs old).  Can you =
give me the name, title, and address of the person to whom I would send =
a note? And anything relevant to their needs, limitations, etc - in =
addition to the EV?  Also, I would plan on getting something on his desk =
within the next couple of weeks. Based on what you know, Is that timing =
good?=20
