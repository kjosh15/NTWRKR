*TL;DR: Happy holidays to you and yours - thanks for being a part of this
big crazy journey!*

I deliberately didn't put any requests into the topline for this update,
because it IS the holidays, and I know each of you have worked your ass off
this year and deserve a break.

That said, this update finds me with some fabulous challenges on my hands,
the biggest of which is that my cofounder is getting cold feet about
selling the company. I think this is in large part due to the validation of
Gallup, EY, and Red Bird Capital wanting to buy us (to say nothing of our
pending large multinational customers) which has shown that we really do
have something interesting on our hands.

His prediction is that EY (the leader in terms of negotiations) will want
to value us on our financials, which are still < $500 ARR. My bet is that
they'll value us based on our potential impact to their business: if we
ONLY doubled the number of contracts in 1% of their existing business
that'd translate into a ~$800,000,000 annual profit... and we think we can
quadruple as many contracts as they build us into across the entire
organization.

More salient than price is that neither of us wants a boss, neither of us
likes bureaucracy, and we both think the product has a glorious big future
that could easily wither inside the confines of an auditing institution.

Nevertheless, my goals remain unchanged: as much as I like this product, I
have a ton of other ventures I'd like to invest in, build, suggest, and
experiment with before I run out of time on the planet. For that I need a
solid base of capital to ensure my family's security, and as much
investment capital, time, and liberty as I can get my hands on.

Like I said, these are fabulous challenges. If you have any thoughts as you
step away from your OWN big challenges I'd love to hear them. And of course
if I can help with yours let me know!

Otherwise, please get some rest this holiday season. Enjoy your family and
friends. Rebuild, recover, and celebrate the goodness in your lives. You've
made a huge difference in mine.

Sincerely,
Josh

P.S. I won't update again until mid-Jan. Looking forward to more exciting
news in 2022!!
