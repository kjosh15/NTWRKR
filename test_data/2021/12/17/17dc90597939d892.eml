Is your offer to connect still available? We shelved the advisory board,
but then onboarded several new enterprise customers and now have M&A
discussions going with one of the Big Four, one similarly sized
consultancy, and one very large investment vehicle. We also have serious
talks progressing fast with three others. Q1 '22 we're looking to launch
with four brand-name Fortune 200's to roughly quadruple our platform size.
I'd dearly love to get your opinion, if you're willing!

Let me know if we can set up a call,
Josh
