Just spoke to Hamza, the guy who made the data aggregation site. I think
there's lots of potential there (and also the chance that nothing will
happen), but thought we could aim to connect all three of us in the new
year to see what you thought.

I.e., nothing to do now (so no worries!) and we'll talk in Jan/Feb. Just
wanted to update you!

All best wishes,
Josh
