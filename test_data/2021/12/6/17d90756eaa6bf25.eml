John,

Big changes afoot; we're about to increase our end user list by 5x
including three Fortune 100 clients, and are having some very fast-moving
conversations with some other big consultancies. We've also gotten
permission to release some case studies on Retention, KPIs, and DE&I
demonstrating significant impact for each (attached).

The Katzenbach Center still looks interesting, but we'd be very keen to
talk to your partnerships team directly if they're open to it. PwC still
feels like the right place to grow, but given how quickly things are
moving, connecting directly (i.e., not via the Center) seems like it might
be a better fit.

Do you know who we could/should reach out to regarding that kind of
JV/direct partnership effort?

Very gratefully,
Josh

                     <br>The Katzenbach Center seems like an ideal contact,=

behaviors.=20
                     <br>
                     <br>Indigometrics provides validated statistical data =
on employee behaviors, organized by the company's values. Because we provid=
e longitudinal data about specific behaviors at the individual, group, and =
corporate level - and have a platform employees find extremely sticky for u=
nderstanding same - we're constantly finding new opportunities for high-val=
ue culture change. We'd like to see if there's a way to collaborate.=20
                     <br>
                     <br>I've attached an overview deck, and a short overvi=
