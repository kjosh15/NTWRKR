You sent what look like four sets of credentials - I'm assuming that two of
them are for FTP only, but can only log into my.hostmysite.com with the
jkle**** login and password. That gives me access to the karenkleinart.com
and the-kleins.us domains. We want to move the agoodday.today domain,
correct?

If that's the case, can you send me the credentials to manage the
agoodday.today domain as well as let me know if you want the
karenkleinart.com and the-kleins.us domains moved also?

Love,
Josh

KarenKleinArt.com. If you mother isn't going to use her art website, you
should be able to move AGoodDay.today by itself. Won't this move/ eliminate
our mail? E.g., if the domain is moved we no longer have mail at Hostmysite
and the URL will have to be set up on the new site before we get mail
again. Yes? Or, am I missing something?
