We may have missed the mark in explaining the product; while the basic
building block is an individual assessment, the individual assessments are
statistically consistent - so we aggregate them up through an organization
to give group, team and enterprise assessments. This has been a major use
case for us as organizations and their advisors look for a data backbone
that helps them manage disparate cultures around their company - for
example after a merger or a business transformation.

Let me know if that makes more sense; perhaps a quick call in January would
make more sense?

Many, many thanks, Jon - I really owe you for doing all this in-betweening!

All best and happy holidays,
Josh
