Is there any way I can enlist your help in selling some stuff on Facebook
Marketplace? I deleted my account ages ago and have no desire to make a new
one, but there's no other (better) way to sell used stuff before the
holidays.

Let me know if this is even possible; happy to share all proceeds,
obviously. And as per my recent text let me know if a walk is in the offing
tomorrow!

All best,
Josh
