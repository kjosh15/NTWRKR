I have in the past  mused about the  idea of a market maker for mergers and=
 acquisitions.[1] Like, you run a public company, you want to sell it, you =
go to an investment bank for advice. =E2=80=9CWe think you could sell your =
company for $10 billion to $12 billion,=E2=80=9D the bank tells you, =E2=80=
=9Cwith a well-run auction process in which we contact a dozen or so potent=
ial strategic and financial buyers. To maximize value=C2=A0we might want to=
 separate out your crown-jewel widgets business and sell it separately to a=
 strategic acquirer, while selling the non-core sprockets and gizmos lines =
to other buyers. We could have a signed deal in three months if we work=C2=
=A0every weekend.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t have time for all that =
stuff,=E2=80=9D you reply. =E2=80=9CWhy don=E2=80=99t=C2=A0you=C2=A0just pa=
y me $10 billion right now, and you take the company, and=C2=A0then=C2=A0yo=
u go figure out how to split up the company and find buyers and maximize pr=
ice? If you get $12 billion for it then hey super you=E2=80=99re up $2=C2=
=A0billion but that=E2=80=99s not my problem, just give me my money now.=E2=
=80=9DInvestment banks mostly don=E2=80=99t do this, but I guess there=E2=
=80=99s no reason why they couldn=E2=80=99t. Take some inventory risk on so=
me companies in order to facilitate liquidity for the sellers of those comp=
anies, and in exchange get, you know, orders of magnitude bigger fees than =
they=E2=80=99d get for basic M&A advice, plus potential huge upside (or dow=
nside) if the companies=E2=80=99 value goes up (or down). Of course when I =
write it out you can see the reasons that they don=E2=80=99t. Big investmen=
t banks are public companies who want stable recurring revenue, not a bunch=
 of huge lumpy=C2=A0gains and losses from owning companies briefly. Smaller=
 investment banks don=E2=80=99t have the capital to go around buying multib=
illion-dollar companies from their clients to flip them. Still it might be=
=C2=A0a useful service if someone could provide it.I know, arguably=C2=A0pr=
ivate equity=C2=A0is in the business of providing it, but not really. PE fu=
nds operate on a different time scale. They have multi-year holding periods=
 and operating expertise; their goal is not so much to bridge buyers and se=
llers of companies by holding inventory (of companies) for a bit and collec=
ting a spread for their service, but to pick good companies whose value wil=
l go up.[2] They are not market makers but proprietary buy-and-hold investo=
rs.This, from Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan=C2=A0at the Financial =
Times, is cool:This week shareholders of Veoneer, a Swedish auto parts make=
r listed in the US, are expected to approve a $4.5bn takeover that pays the=
m a lofty 85 per cent premium to the company=E2=80=99s pre-deal trading pri=
ce.What stands out about the deal is its structure. The auction for Veoneer=
 was won in October by a start-up New York investment firm called SSW Partn=
ers. The firm had never executed a transaction, had raised no dedicated buy=
out fund and maintained only a bare-bones website. ...The structure of thei=
r pending agreement with Veoneer has drawn the attention of the mergers and=
 acquisitions industry. It reimagines how big corporations buy pieces of co=
mpanies that would otherwise need to be acquired as a whole, deploying the =
bounty of private capital sloshing around the world while keeping financial=
 disclosures to a minimum.Qualcomm found itself in a jam this summer before=
 the SSW arrangement took shape. The California company was interested in V=
eoneer=E2=80=99s autonomous vehicle software business with which it already=
 had a joint venture. But the Sweden-based company had in July agreed to se=
ll itself for $3.8bn to Magna International, a car parts supplier.Making a =
rival bid for all of Veoneer made little sense to Qualcomm as it had no int=
erest in the remaining divisions. Yet Veoneer preferred to be sold in full.=
Qualcomm would then turn to an unknown private capital firm: SSW.The result=
ing bid bested Magna=E2=80=99s. Under a novel structure, SSW will acquire =
=E2=80=9Call the outstanding capital stock of Veoneer,=E2=80=9D and then im=
mediately sell the autonomous vehicle software unit to Qualcomm, according =
to a press release describing the transaction. SSW is to then =E2=80=9Clead=
 the process of finding strong, long-term strategic partners=E2=80=9D for V=
eoneer=E2=80=99s remaining auto parts businesses, indicating its intention =
sell them.=C2=A0SSW is three big-name banker types (Eric Schwartz, formerly=
 of Goldman;=C2=A0Joshua Steiner, formerly of Quadrangle Group, who also se=
rves as a senior advisor at Bloomberg L.P., where he was previously Head of=
 Industry Verticals; and Antonio Weiss, formerly of Lazard) who will buy Ve=
oneer, hand over the autonomous-vehicle business to Qualcomm, and keep the =
rest themselves to run a sales process. Veoneer gets to sell what it wants =
(the entire company), Qualcomm gets to buy what it wants (the autonomous-ve=
hicle business), and SSW bridges the transaction with its own capital and f=
igures out what to do with the remainder. Indap and Fontanella-Khan write:T=
hose close to the deal said that SSW was approached because the traditional=
 way of divesting unwanted assets =E2=80=94 having the buyer simply sell of=
f unwanted units piecemeal =E2=80=94 was usually distracting and destroyed =
value. A typical private equity partner might not have been as flexible as =
SSW, said these people.It is not totally clear that this way of divesting u=
nwanted assets =E2=80=94=C2=A0have them owned by some investment bankers tr=
ying to=C2=A0flip them =E2=80=94=C2=A0won=E2=80=99t be distracting or destr=
oy value, but it=E2=80=99s fun to find out. From the press release announci=
ng the deal:=E2=80=9CWe are excited to partner with Qualcomm to acquire Veo=
neer,=E2=80=9D said Antonio Weiss and Josh Steiner of SSW Partners. =E2=80=
=9CWhile Qualcomm focuses on the Arriver business, we will focus on finding=
 strong, long-term strategic homes for the rest of Veoneer=E2=80=99s busine=
sses =E2=80=93 we are committed to ensuring that Veoneer=E2=80=99s employee=
s prosper, the businesses continue to innovate and grow and customers conti=
nue to have uninterrupted access to the outstanding service and quality for=
 which Veoneer is known. We have high regard for Veoneer=E2=80=99s manageme=
nt team and look forward to partnering with them to ensure a successful out=
come for all stakeholders.=E2=80=9DMaybe that=E2=80=99s cool? To be owned f=
or a few months by some bankers working on a flip? If Qualcomm bought the w=
hole thing, integrated the part it wanted, and tried to sell the parts it d=
idn=E2=80=99t, the people in those unwanted parts would feel pretty unloved=
. The Qualcomm executives would be focused on maximizing the long-term valu=
e of the stuff they=C2=A0were keeping, and would not lavish a lot of attent=
ion on the stuff they were selling. Whereas SSW will earn its money by maki=
ng the leftover stuff as pretty as possible until it can sell. I don=E2=80=
=99t think they have a ton of incentives to cut corners or neglect the busi=
ness as they try to sell it? If your house is on the market you keep it cle=
an and spring for fresh flowers.Now, it=E2=80=99s not clear that SSW=C2=A0e=
xactly has =E2=80=9Cits own capital,=E2=80=9D and it is not exactly an inve=
stment bank.=C2=A0(It=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ca Delaware limited partnership bas=
ed in New York that invests in high-quality businesses and collaborates wit=
h partners to create enduring value for all stakeholders,=E2=80=9D says Veo=
neer=E2=80=99s merger proxy. The press release says: =E2=80=9CSSW Partners=
=E2=80=99 investment in Veoneer will represent its first capital commitment=
 as a partnership since its founding at the beginning of the year.=E2=80=9D=
) Indap and Fontanella-Khan write:SSW has not disclosed who is providing it=
s portion of the acquisition financing. It is not relying on debt financing=
, according to a person close to the firm. =E2=80=A6 But its founders have =
historical ties to large global investors.=C2=A0And Qualcomm is effectively=
 backstopping SSW=E2=80=99s financing: Qualcomm is on the hook to buy all o=
f Veoneer if SSW doesn=E2=80=99t show up with financing.There is a lot of a=
d hoc capital out there these days. The traditional way to take a company p=
ublic is that you go to an investment bank, the investment bank sells your =
shares to the public, the price you get depends on what the public market w=
ill pay, and the bank gets a cash fee when it finishes. The 2021 way to tak=
e a company public is with a SPAC, a special purpose acquisition company: A=
 sponsor raises an ad hoc investing pool and then takes a company public at=
 a negotiated-in-advance=C2=A0price using the money in the investing pool, =
and is rewarded with a chunk of the company and potentially huge upside.[3]=

Of course just doing deals business the regular way  has been pretty lucrat=
ive this year:Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may boost its bonus pool for investm=
ent banking by about 50%, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. may reach for a 40% incr=
ease, according to people with knowledge of their initial deliberations. Th=
e business, which covers merger-and-acquisition advisory as well as underwr=
iting groups, is poised for the biggest windfalls after recent meetings to =
set pay for the year, the people said, asking not to be named discussing in=
ternal talks.Across Wall Street, bosses are under mounting pressure to be m=
ore generous after tempering raises at the end of 2020 amid concerns that a=
 surge in business set off by the pandemic might not last. Now, with signs =
pointing to yet another robust year ahead, senior executives are facing wor=
kers who, in many cases, feel that they=E2=80=99re owed and ready to jump t=
o competitors if their employers skimp.That is from a Bloomberg News articl=
e that I wanted to include here mainly for this Eric Dobkin quote:=E2=80=9C=
You are paying for retention and not just paying for performance,=E2=80=9D =
said Eric Dobkin, the veteran banker who spent almost half a century at Gol=
dman Sachs before retiring in 2016. =E2=80=9CThis year, the firms may well =
have to overpay to keep the people they most want.=E2=80=9DDobkin helped sh=
ape the modern IPO market and espoused the value of a firm=E2=80=99s brand =
in winning deals over the singular skill of individuals, a view embraced by=
 a number of current Wall Street leaders. One former underling recalls Dobk=
in=E2=80=99s colorful repartees to bankers that included stingers like: =E2=
=80=9CMy dog in a Goldman Sachs T-shirt would win that business.=E2=80=9DI =
assume that if Goldman fielded an investment banking team consisting entire=
ly of dogs in T-shirts it would get a lot of mandates these days, which is =
probably an argument against paying up for talent.=C2=A0

Insider trading, I like to say, is not about fairness, it=E2=80=99s about t=
heft. It=E2=80=99s not illegal to trade on information that nobody else kno=
ws; it=E2=80=99s illegal to trade on information that you got wrongly, that=
 you had some duty not to use for your advantage or that someone had some d=
uty not to disclose to you. (This is not legal advice, of course, and is in=
 any case mostly about=C2=A0U.S.=C2=A0law; other countries often have more =
information-parity-oriented rules.)One classic case of this is that it is n=
ot generally illegal to trade on your own intentions. Most simply, if you k=
now that you want to buy stock, and nobody else does, you can still buy sto=
ck. This is true even if your buying is material to other people. If Warren=
 Buffett says =E2=80=9Chey I bought 5% of XYZ,=E2=80=9D the stock will go u=
p. But he can still buy it before announcing that. It=E2=80=99s his busines=
s. Similarly if the chief executive officer of a company says =E2=80=9Chey =
I sold all my shares,=E2=80=9D the stock will go down. But she can still se=
ll before announcing it.=C2=A0There are some tricky issues here. If you wor=
k for Warren Buffett=E2=80=99s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and you are in the =
business of bringing him companies to buy, and you spot a great company, an=
d you write up a compelling report saying =E2=80=9CI think we should buy XY=
Z,=E2=80=9D and you put it on his desk, and then you go buy some stock in X=
YZ =E2=80=94=C2=A0there you are arguably using information that does=C2=A0n=
ot=C2=A0belong to you, that belongs to Berkshire Hathaway.[4] (The informat=
ion is not the good stuff about the company that you put in the report, whi=
ch is presumably public, but rather=C2=A0the fact that Warren Buffett might=
 buy the company, because you told him to, as part of your job.) You don=E2=
=80=99t exactly own your research, if you work at Berkshire Hathaway; Berks=
hire does.Another question is: If you do own your own plans, and your own r=
esearch, can you=C2=A0sell=C2=A0it? Can you give it away? Can you barter it=
 for something useful for you?=C2=A0If you plan to launch a hostile takeove=
r of=C2=A0a company, or an activist proxy fight,=C2=A0can you call up your =
hedge-fund buddies and say =E2=80=9Chey I=E2=80=99m gonna go to work on Com=
pany X, I need my friends to be shareholders so they=E2=80=99ll vote for my=
 deal, why don=E2=80=99t you buy some stock now and then owe me a favor=E2=
=80=9D? Your buddies get to trade on nonpublic information (that you=E2=80=
=99re going to announce a proxy fight or=C2=A0merger proposal), and will ma=
ke money, but you own that information (it=E2=80=99s your own plans) and yo=
u=E2=80=99re giving it to them to advance your own business interests. Okay=
? Or what?[5]Or a classic is: You are in the business of finding bad compan=
ies, betting that their stocks will go down, and then putting out research =
explaining why they are bad. If your reports are good, the stocks will go d=
own and you will make money. But this is a risky and capital-intensive busi=
ness, and you might want to=C2=A0also sell=C2=A0your research to hedge fund=
s in advance. The hedge funds will also short the stock and hope to make mo=
ney when your report comes out, and they will pay you for your effort so th=
at you are not reliant on your own short-sale trades to make all your money=
.I feel like when I describe it like that:=09It seems fine to me?=09It prob=
ably doesn=E2=80=99t seem fine to normal people?Like, =E2=80=9Cevil short-s=
eller researchers are writing mean reports about public companies, and then=
 selling early access to those reports to secretive hedge funds who will be=
t against those companies, and then publishing those reports trying to mani=
pulate the companies=E2=80=99 stock prices down so the evil hedge funds wil=
l make money,=E2=80=9D that sort of thing. Again seems fine to me! (If the =
reports are true!) But not going to make you popular with (1) companies, (2=
) shareholders or (3) I am going to guess prosecutors? Anyway  here=E2=80=
=99s a story=C2=A0from Bloomberg=E2=80=99s=C2=A0Katia Porzecanski, Tom Scho=

 how hedge funds tap into research and set up their bets, especially in the=

At a big universal bank=C2=A0there are lots of different groups that are in=
 the basic business of helping clients invest and lending those clients mon=
ey, and those groups have some overlap with each other, and there will be a=
 certain amount of competition and turf battles between them. Ideally all t=
he groups at any one bank will be working toward a common goal of maximizin=
g value for the bank (and the client), and they=E2=80=99ll share resources =
and credit and not waste their time fighting each other. But in practice su=
re sometimes it will get nasty. But since you all work at the same bank, th=
ere is some final arbiter of your infighting. You go to your boss, and the =
other team goes to their boss, and your bosses go to their bosses, and thei=
r bosses go their joint boss, and the joint boss =E2=80=94=C2=A0the person =
who sits on top of the pyramid containing=C2=A0both of your teams =E2=80=94=
=C2=A0says =E2=80=9CI think private wealth should take the lead on this one=

e commission credits to private banking,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cman, leave me=
 alone, you=C2=A0can work this out.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0So there are limits to ho=
w heated the rivalry can get. For instance it is not like one group at a ba=
nk would ever=C2=A0sue=C2=A0another group at the same bank? In federal cour=
t? Asking for an injunction to make the other group back off the first grou=
p=E2=80=99s clients? Well!This action arises from the ongoing efforts by J.=
P. Morgan Private Bank (the =E2=80=9CPrivate Bank=E2=80=9D) to poach Plaint=
iff Gwen Campbell=E2=80=99s relationships with her financial advisory clien=
ts following her move from Merrill Lynch to J.P. Morgan Advisors (=E2=80=9C=
J.P. Morgan=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CJPMA=E2=80=9D) in October 2020.=C2=A0After=
 J.P. Morgan aggressively recruited Campbell and persuaded her to move her =
clients with explicit contractual promises they would not be poached by oth=
er groups at the bank, the Private Bank began ruthlessly soliciting her cli=
ents, disparaging her, and preventing clients from sending assets to Campbe=
ll (and redirecting them to the Private Bank) without her consent. In recen=
t weeks, the Private Bank has significantly escalated its attacks on Campbe=
ll=E2=80=99s client relationships and thwarted her ability to execute clien=
t transactions while, after months of promising to make things right, Campb=
ell=E2=80=99s superiors at J.P. Morgan have conceded that they are powerles=
s to help. As a result of the misrepresentations and breaches by J.P. Morga=
n, Campbell is suffering irreparable harm to her business, her reputation, =
and the client goodwill that has taken her decades to build.That is from th=
e federal complaint that JPMorgan Advisors filed against JPMorgan Private B=
ank. Oh no fine it is from the federal complaint that Gwen Campbell, a mana=
ging director who runs=C2=A0a high-profile JPMorgan Advisors team (she advi=
ses Alex Rodriguez), filed against JPMorgan. The=C2=A0Financial Times expla=
ins:She has filed for a temporary restraining order against JPMorgan to res=
trict her co-workers=E2=80=99 ability to engage with her clients, as she se=
eks damages through arbitration for what she alleges is a breach of contrac=
t.In the blistering 48-page legal filing, Campbell describes the turf war b=
etween rival businesses at JPMorgan as a =E2=80=9Cshark tank=E2=80=9D, clai=
ming her co-workers have disparaged and undermined her.The bank has said Ca=
mpbell=E2=80=99s claims =E2=80=9Chave no merit and we look forward to prese=
nting the facts to the court=E2=80=9D. =E2=80=A6JPMorgan Advisors=E2=80=99 =
model is to employ financial advisers who get paid mostly on commission. Th=
e bank=E2=80=99s relationship with wealthy clients is funnelled primarily t=
hrough these advisers. The private bank also caters to rich clients but the=
y tend to have dealings with the bank as a whole.There is co-operation on t=
hings that one unit offers but the other does not. However, they also at ti=
mes compete for the same business, including lending and providing investme=
nt advice, a dynamic which can create tension.=E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t fe=
el like you=E2=80=99re working at the same company. You feel like you=E2=80=
=99re working at different firms,=E2=80=9D said one former JPMorgan private=
 banker.The complaint puts forward a theory that the Private Bank has an ad=
vantage=C2=A0internally because private bankers eat less of what they kill =
than JPMorgan Advisors advisers do:Campbell was particularly wary of potent=
ial channel conflicts involving the Private Bank. The Private Bank offers m=
any services that overlap with services offered by JPMA advisors, including=
 lending and investment advisory services for high-net-worth clients. And b=
ecause of the different compensation structures for financial advisors and =
private bankers at J.P. Morgan, there are organizational incentives to shif=
t client assets from under the management of JPMA advisors to the Private B=
ank. Financial advisors, who spend years cultivating relationships and buil=
ding trust and goodwill with their clients, receive commissions or shares o=
f the revenues based on the financial products that they sell or transactio=
ns they arrange for their clients. Private bankers, however, are not expect=
ed to generate their own business from scratch and therefore are paid less,=
 receiving salaries plus bonuses that can be impacted by bringing business =
into the Private Bank. In addition, as J.P. Morgan=E2=80=99s San Francisco =
Regional Director and Campbell=E2=80=99s direct manager Steve McCashin told=
 Campbell after she arrived at J.P. Morgan, individual private bankers are =
often fueled by the prestige and power within the firm of having =E2=80=9Co=
wnership=E2=80=9D over relationships with high-profile individuals. Thus, C=
ampbell sought explicit assurances from senior management at J.P. Morgan th=
at the other divisions within the firm, particularly the Private Bank, woul=
d not compete for the client relationships she had invested so much time an=
d effort in building.I have to say I love this and wish there was more of i=
t? Bankers regularly sue their employers and colleagues when they have been=
 pushed out, etc., but I cannot think of another case where a banker stayed=
 at her bank and sued a competing internal group for poaching her clients. =
But now Campbell has shown that it is possible! If you run a group at a ban=
k, and you=E2=80=99re mad at another group for talking to your clients, now=
 you can sue them. I bet you want to!Campbell=C2=A0is also suing JPMorgan f=
or doing a bad job of setting up her work-from-home technology?Beyond the s=
ecret solicitations, J.P. Morgan has left Campbell without reliable access =
to the firm=E2=80=99s technological systems for months. Under her contract,=
 the Americans with Disabilities Act (=E2=80=9CADA=E2=80=9D), and Californi=
a=E2=80=99s Fair Employment and Housing Act (=E2=80=9CFEHA=E2=80=9D), Campb=
ell secured an accommodation to work from home throughout the COVID-19 pand=
emic because she and her son are both severely immunocompromised, requiring=
 monthly blood transfusions. For months, she has been promised access and f=
or months, JPMA has failed to deliver. No amount of begging JPMA=E2=80=99s =
IT staff or senior management for a solution has proved effective.I=E2=80=
=99ve had jobs like that! It did not occur to me to sue.

of AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron:Instead of answering to stuffy bea=

rash, Extremely Online traders who either love AMC and the movie industry, =
want to destroy the short-selling hedge funds that they believe are conspir=
ing to put the company out of business, or some combination thereof.=C2=A0"=
We're one of the few companies on the New York Stock Exchange where individ=
ual retail investors are clearly in control of the company. They own the co=
mpany," CEO Adam Aron told Insider in a recent interview.That means AMC has=
 "been navigating through uncharted waters," as Aron put it, requiring a no=
vel approach to investor communications. =E2=80=A6Meanwhile, AMC has built =
a $1.6 billion war chest, capitalizing on the surging demand to sell more t=
han a $1 billion in stock. That will help in paying down debt and also purs=
uing new initiatives."We're going to make sure we use that war chest as the=
 precious thing that it is," Aron said, adding that it should last the comp=
any for "years and years."It starts with an anecdote about Aron blowing off=
 meetings with Wall Street analysts because they are no longer relevant to =
AMC. I think Aron would probably be my pick for Financial Person of the Yea=
r? Musk is world-historically good at maximizing shareholder value and rais=
ing capital at favorable prices through the power of being weird on the int=
ernet, but I suspect that is mostly a side effect of him being genuinely we=
ird and, in ways both good and annoying, a visionary about actual things (e=
lectric cars, rockets, etc.). Aron is some guy who runs a public company. H=
e has two Harvard degrees, worked for Apollo for a while, and has had a lon=

ational business decision to embrace his meme status and talk about apes an=

this because it is good for shareholders, and he wants to do a good job.It =

[1] I am being a little casual with the term =E2=80=9Cmarket maker.=E2=80=
=9D When we=E2=80=99ve discussed this in the past, it has been by analogy t=
o the =E2=80=9CiBuyer=E2=80=9D home-buying product, where tech-enabled comp=
anies compete to buy houses as principal and then resell them. They are not=
 really making two-sided markets; if they don=E2=80=99t have inventory they=
 can=E2=80=99t sell you a house. Similarly here if you want to *buy* a comp=
any you might go to an investment bank and say =E2=80=9Chey find me an auto=
-parts company=E2=80=9D and the bank will be like =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s a=
 list of 10 good ones, we can contact their CEOs for you.=E2=80=9D But if y=
ou said =E2=80=9Cno I don=E2=80=99t have time for that, I=E2=80=99ll just p=
ay you $1 billion for one of them, you deliver it to me today, and then you=
 go figure out how to buy it from its current owners,=E2=80=9D that would o=
bviously not work. In the text I am focusing on the intermediating-trades-u=
sing-its-own-capital aspect of a market maker, not the making-two-sided-mar=
kets aspect.[2] Also private equity buyers often, as it were, pay the sprea=
d: They often buy companies after=C2=A0winning an auction against other buy=
ers in a thorough sale process, so flipping the company to those other buye=
rs makes no sense.[3] I am exaggerating a little bit for effect here: The S=
PAC is not =E2=80=9Can ad hoc investing pool=E2=80=9D in the sense that big=
 investors commit to it for the long term (it=E2=80=99s publicly traded, of=
ten by retail, and the investors can get their money back), and the negotia=
ted price is at-risk in that the investors can withdraw before the deal clo=
ses. Still in its broad outlines the SPAC looks like this.[4] This hypothet=
ical is based loosely on a real fact pattern at Berkshire.[5] A version of =
this is the  toehold that Pershing Square bought in Allergan Inc. as part o=
f Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.=E2=80=99s attempted hostile ta=
keover of Allergan.=C2=A0This  got Pershing Square sued, and ultimately it =
settled, because the SEC=E2=80=99s tender offer rules are a weird exception=
 to the general =E2=80=9Cnot fairness but theft=E2=80=9D rule of insider tr=
ading. If you know about someone=E2=80=99s plans to do a tender offer, you =
can=E2=80=99t trade, even if they gave you that information freely because =
they wanted you to trade. There are also potential Section 13 =E2=80=9Cgrou=
p=E2=80=9D issues with stuff like this, which are separate from insider tra=
ding.

ur company for $10 billion to $12 billion,=E2=80=9D the bank tells you, =E2=
=80=9Cwith a well-run auction process in which we contact a dozen or so pot=
ential strategic and financial buyers. To maximize value=C2=A0we might want=
 to separate out your crown-jewel widgets business and sell it separately t=
o a strategic acquirer, while selling the non-core sprockets and gizmos lin=
es to other buyers. We could have a signed deal in three months if we work=
=C2=A0every weekend.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t have time for all th=
at stuff,=E2=80=9D you reply. =E2=80=9CWhy don=E2=80=99t=C2=A0<em>you=C2=A0=
</em>just pay me $10 billion right now, and you take the company, and=C2=A0=
then=C2=A0<em>you </em>go figure out how to split up the company and find b=
uyers and maximize price? If you get $12 billion for it then hey super you=
=E2=80=99re up $2=C2=A0billion but that=E2=80=99s not my problem, just give=
 me my money now.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Investment banks=
 mostly don=E2=80=99t do this, but I guess there=E2=80=99s no reason why th=
ey couldn=E2=80=99t. Take some inventory risk on some companies in order to=
 facilitate liquidity for the sellers of those companies, and in exchange g=
et, you know, orders of magnitude bigger fees than they=E2=80=99d get for b=
asic M&amp;A advice, plus potential huge upside (or downside) if the compan=
ies=E2=80=99 value goes up (or down). Of course when I write it out you can=
 see the reasons that they don=E2=80=99t. Big investment banks are public c=
ompanies who want stable recurring revenue, not a bunch of huge lumpy=C2=A0=
gains and losses from owning companies briefly. Smaller investment banks do=
n=E2=80=99t have the capital to go around buying multibillion-dollar compan=
ies from their clients to flip them. Still it might be=C2=A0a useful servic=
e if someone could provide it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">I know, argu=
ably=C2=A0<em>private equity=C2=A0</em>is in the business of providing it, =
but not really. PE funds operate on a different time scale. They have multi=
-year holding periods and operating expertise; their goal is not so much to=
 bridge buyers and sellers of companies by holding inventory (of companies)=
 for a bit and collecting a spread for their service, but to pick good comp=
anies whose value will go up.[2] They are not market makers but proprietary=
 buy-and-hold investors.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">This, <a href=3D"h=

=3D"margin: 16px 0;">This week shareholders of Veoneer, a Swedish auto part=
s maker listed in the US, are expected to approve a $4.5bn takeover that pa=
ys them a lofty 85 per cent premium to the company=E2=80=99s pre-deal tradi=
ng price.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">What stands out about the deal is=
 its structure. The auction for Veoneer was won in October by a start-up Ne=
w York investment firm called SSW Partners. The firm had never executed a t=
ransaction, had raised no dedicated buyout fund and maintained only a bare-=
bones website. ...</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The structure of their p=
ending agreement with Veoneer has drawn the attention of the mergers and ac=
quisitions industry. It reimagines how big corporations buy pieces of compa=
nies that would otherwise need to be acquired as a whole, deploying the bou=
nty of private capital sloshing around the world while keeping financial di=
sclosures to a minimum.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Qualcomm found itse=
lf in a jam this summer before the SSW arrangement took shape. The Californ=
ia company was interested in Veoneer=E2=80=99s autonomous vehicle software =
business with which it already had a joint venture. But the Sweden-based co=
mpany had in July agreed to sell itself for $3.8bn to Magna International, =
a car parts supplier.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Making a rival bid fo=
r all of Veoneer made little sense to Qualcomm as it had no interest in the=
 remaining divisions. Yet Veoneer preferred to be sold in full.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Qualcomm would then turn to an unknown private capital=
 firm: SSW.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The resulting bid bested Magna=
=E2=80=99s. Under a novel structure, SSW will acquire =E2=80=9Call the outs=
tanding capital stock of Veoneer,=E2=80=9D and then immediately sell the au=
tonomous vehicle software unit to Qualcomm, according to a press release de=
scribing the transaction. SSW is to then =E2=80=9Clead the process of findi=
ng strong, long-term strategic partners=E2=80=9D for Veoneer=E2=80=99s rema=
ining auto parts businesses, indicating its intention sell them.=C2=A0</p><=

Veoneer gets to sell what it wants (the entire company), Qualcomm gets to b=

that you go to an investment bank, the investment bank sells your shares to=
 the public, the price you get depends on what the public market will pay, =
and the bank gets a cash fee when it finishes. The 2021 way to take a compa=

PMorgan Chase &amp; Co. may reach for a 40% increase, according to people w=
ith knowledge of their initial deliberations. The business, which covers me=
rger-and-acquisition advisory as well as underwriting groups, is poised for=
 the biggest windfalls after recent meetings to set pay for the year, the p=
eople said, asking not to be named discussing internal talks.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Across Wall Street, bosses are under mounting pressure=
 to be more generous after tempering raises at the end of 2020 amid concern=
s that a surge in business set off by the pandemic might not last. Now, wit=
h signs pointing to yet another robust year ahead, senior executives are fa=
cing workers who, in many cases, feel that they=E2=80=99re owed and ready t=
o jump to competitors if their employers skimp.</p></blockquote><p style=3D=

ear, the firms may well have to overpay to keep the people they most want.=
=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Dobkin helped shape the modern IP=

over the singular skill of individuals, a view embraced by a number of curr=

rful repartees to bankers that included stingers like: =E2=80=9CMy dog in a=
 Goldman Sachs T-shirt would win that business.=E2=80=9D</p></blockquote><p=
 style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">I assume that if Goldman fielded an investment b=

 about fairness, it=E2=80=99s about theft. It=E2=80=99s not illegal to trad=
e on information that nobody else knows; it=E2=80=99s illegal to trade on i=
nformation that you got wrongly, that you had some duty not to use for your=
 advantage or that someone had some duty not to disclose to you. (This is n=
ot legal advice, of course, and is in any case mostly about=C2=A0<em>U.S.=
=C2=A0</em>law; other countries often have more information-parity-oriented=
 rules.)</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">One classic case of this is that i=
t is not generally illegal to trade on your own intentions. Most simply, if=
 you know that you want to buy stock, and nobody else does, you can still b=
uy stock. This is true even if your buying is material to other people. If =
Warren Buffett says =E2=80=9Chey I bought 5% of XYZ,=E2=80=9D the stock wil=
l go up. But he can still buy it before announcing that. It=E2=80=99s his b=
usiness. Similarly if the chief executive officer of a company says =E2=80=
=9Chey I sold all my shares,=E2=80=9D the stock will go down. But she can s=
till sell before announcing it.=C2=A0</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">There=
 are some tricky issues here. If you work for Warren Buffett=E2=80=99s Berk=
shire Hathaway Inc., and you are in the business of bringing him companies =
to buy, and you spot a great company, and you write up a compelling report =
saying =E2=80=9CI think we should buy XYZ,=E2=80=9D and you put it on his d=
esk, and then you go buy some stock in XYZ =E2=80=94=C2=A0there you are arg=
uably using information that does=C2=A0<em>not=C2=A0</em>belong to you, tha=
t belongs to Berkshire Hathaway.[4] (The information is not the good stuff =
about the company that you put in the report, which is presumably public, b=
ut rather=C2=A0<em>the fact that Warren Buffett might buy the company</em>,=
 because you told him to, as part of your job.) You don=E2=80=99t exactly o=
wn your research, if you work at Berkshire Hathaway; Berkshire does.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Another question is: If you do own your own plans=
, and your own research, can you=C2=A0<em>sell=C2=A0</em>it? Can you give i=
t away? Can you barter it for something useful for you?=C2=A0If you plan to=
 launch a hostile takeover of=C2=A0a company, or an activist proxy fight,=
=C2=A0can you call up your hedge-fund buddies and say =E2=80=9Chey I=E2=80=
=99m gonna go to work on Company X, I need my friends to be shareholders so=
 they=E2=80=99ll vote for my deal, why don=E2=80=99t you buy some stock now=
 and then owe me a favor=E2=80=9D? Your buddies get to trade on nonpublic i=

ger proposal), and will make money, but you own that information (it=E2=80=

wn business interests. Okay? Or what?[5]</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Or=
 a classic is: You are in the business of finding bad companies, betting th=
at their stocks will go down, and then putting out research explaining why =
they are bad. If your reports are good, the stocks will go down and you wil=
l make money. But this is a risky and capital-intensive business, and you m=
ight want to=C2=A0also sell=C2=A0your research to hedge funds in advance. T=
he hedge funds will also short the stock and hope to make money when your r=
eport comes out, and they will pay you for your effort so that you are not =
reliant on your own short-sale trades to make all your money.</p><p style=

ises from the ongoing efforts by J.P. Morgan Private Bank (the =E2=80=9CPri=
vate Bank=E2=80=9D) to poach Plaintiff Gwen Campbell=E2=80=99s relationship=
s with her financial advisory clients following her move from Merrill Lynch=
 to J.P. Morgan Advisors (=E2=80=9CJ.P. Morgan=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CJPMA=E2=
=80=9D) in October 2020.=C2=A0After J.P. Morgan aggressively recruited Camp=
bell and persuaded her to move her clients with explicit contractual promis=
es they would not be poached by other groups at the bank, the Private Bank =
began ruthlessly soliciting her clients, disparaging her, and preventing cl=
ients from sending assets to Campbell (and redirecting them to the Private =
Bank) without her consent. In recent weeks, the Private Bank has significan=
tly escalated its attacks on Campbell=E2=80=99s client relationships and th=
warted her ability to execute client transactions while, after months of pr=
omising to make things right, Campbell=E2=80=99s superiors at J.P. Morgan h=
ave conceded that they are powerless to help. As a result of the misreprese=
ntations and breaches by J.P. Morgan, Campbell is suffering irreparable har=
m to her business, her reputation, and the client goodwill that has taken h=
er decades to build.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">That is f=
rom the federal complaint that JPMorgan Advisors filed against JPMorgan Pri=

age with her clients, as she seeks damages through arbitration for what she=
 alleges is a breach of contract.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">In the bl=
istering 48-page legal filing, Campbell describes the turf war between riva=
l businesses at JPMorgan as a =E2=80=9Cshark tank=E2=80=9D, claiming her co=
-workers have disparaged and undermined her.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;=

p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">JPMorgan Advisors=E2=80=99 model is to employ f=
inancial advisers who get paid mostly on commission. The bank=E2=80=99s rel=
ationship with wealthy clients is funnelled primarily through these adviser=
s. The private bank also caters to rich clients but they tend to have deali=
ngs with the bank as a whole.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">There is co-o=
peration on things that one unit offers but the other does not. However, th=
ey also at times compete for the same business, including lending and provi=

g at the same company. You feel like you=E2=80=99re working at different fi=
rms,=E2=80=9D said one former JPMorgan private banker.</p></blockquote><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The complaint puts forward a theory that the Priva=
te Bank has an advantage=C2=A0internally because private bankers eat less o=
f what they kill than JPMorgan Advisors advisers do:</p><blockquote><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Campbell was particularly wary of potential channel c=
onflicts involving the Private Bank. The Private Bank offers many services =
that overlap with services offered by JPMA advisors, including lending and =
investment advisory services for high-net-worth clients. And because of the=
 different compensation structures for financial advisors and private banke=
rs at J.P. Morgan, there are organizational incentives to shift client asse=
ts from under the management of JPMA advisors to the Private Bank. Financia=
l advisors, who spend years cultivating relationships and building trust an=
d goodwill with their clients, receive commissions or shares of the revenue=
s based on the financial products that they sell or transactions they arran=
ge for their clients. Private bankers, however, are not expected to generat=
e their own business from scratch and therefore are paid less, receiving sa=
laries plus bonuses that can be impacted by bringing business into the Priv=
ate Bank. In addition, as J.P. Morgan=E2=80=99s San Francisco Regional Dire=
ctor and Campbell=E2=80=99s direct manager Steve McCashin told Campbell aft=
er she arrived at J.P. Morgan, individual private bankers are often fueled =
by the prestige and power within the firm of having =E2=80=9Cownership=E2=
=80=9D over relationships with high-profile individuals. Thus, Campbell sou=
ght explicit assurances from senior management at J.P. Morgan that the othe=
r divisions within the firm, particularly the Private Bank, would not compe=
te for the client relationships she had invested so much time and effort in=
 building.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">I have to say I lov=
e this and wish there was more of it? Bankers regularly sue their employers=
 and colleagues when they have been pushed out, etc., but I cannot think of=
 another case where a banker stayed at her bank and sued a competing intern=
al group for poaching her clients. But now Campbell has shown that it is po=
ssible! If you run a group at a bank, and you=E2=80=99re mad at another gro=
up for talking to your clients, now you can sue them. I bet you want to!</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Campbell=C2=A0is also suing JPMorgan for doin=
g a bad job of setting up her work-from-home technology?</p><blockquote><p =
style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Beyond the secret solicitations, J.P. Morgan has =
left Campbell without reliable access to the firm=E2=80=99s technological s=
ystems for months. Under her contract, the Americans with Disabilities Act =
(=E2=80=9CADA=E2=80=9D), and California=E2=80=99s Fair Employment and Housi=
ng Act (=E2=80=9CFEHA=E2=80=9D), Campbell secured an accommodation to work =
from home throughout the COVID-19 pandemic because she and her son are both=
 severely immunocompromised, requiring monthly blood transfusions. For mont=
hs, she has been promised access and for months, JPMA has failed to deliver=
. No amount of begging JPMA=E2=80=99s IT staff or senior management for a s=
olution has proved effective.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">=
I=E2=80=99ve had jobs like that! It did not occur to me to sue.</p><table c=
