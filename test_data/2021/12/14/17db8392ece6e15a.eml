J=C3=B6rg,

I really debated sending this to you as I have no idea if it's really
relevant or not. Figured if nothing else it could be an invitation for you
to yell at me / something or for me to better refine what I'm looking for.
Any feedback appreciated!

Looking forward to speaking again soon,
Josh

"This is a phase 1 open-label study of ASP9801 administered by intratumoral
injection in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. ASP9801 is
a genetically engineered oncolytic vaccinia virus that expresses two
cytokines, IL-7 and IL-12, that help stimulate antitumor immune responses.
ASP9801 was effective in multiple immunocompetent mouse models and showed
promising results in both directly treated tumors and distant tumors. This
study will for the first time assess the safety, tolerability and antitumor
activity of this oncolytic vaccinia virus in patients with cancer."
