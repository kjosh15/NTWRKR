*TL;DR: How do you get the Big 4 hungry and competing, without pissing
anyone off?*

EY UK is talking to us today about doing another project - basically to
clear whether they can buy us if things work out. EY US is expediting
paperwork so they can pitch us for a dozen projects. And KPMG, Accenture,
Gallup, and Red Bird Capital are slowly circulating NDAs.

Obviously I'm keen to get those latter four into the ring and providing
contracts, but more importantly I want to make them feel like they're
actively competing and to consider making an early (and big) bid.

Given that it's almost the holidays this is looking like a January
conversation... but EY is racing ahead in the meantime.

Do you have a view on how to get the laggards to jump into catching up,
without making them feel they've lost the race? And do you have any tips on
managing EY to keep them from pushing hard for noncompetes while still
enticing them with a buy option?
