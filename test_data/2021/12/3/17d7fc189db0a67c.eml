You ask good questions! I would say that culture is always cyclical, but
some activities are needed to front load the process. In this case I'd
suggest crafting a vision and using the belonging exercise to refine/create
ownership of it in parallel with future casting activities. I.e., "here is
*a* vision - is it the right one, and what KPIs are needed to really
support that?" Framing it as iterative and ongoing creates a lot of room
for exploration, ownership, and aligned growth.

Put another way, organizations have historically done this process really
slowly. We have found that it tightens dramatically as soon as you surface
your ideas to your workforce regularly and start iterating. It's simply
unavoidable that you're learning changes significantly through employees
interacting with your ideas weekly.

How does that fit into your thinking on your four main goals?
