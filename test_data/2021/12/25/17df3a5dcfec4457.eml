Sorry; can she point them to my e-mail address? Otherwise the boots and
razor were ~40,000 ISK each, new, so some percent of that (no idea what the
FB market is like, but I=E2=80=99m not using this stuff and would be happy =
to sell
them!) The shoes were maybe 20,000 ISK.

Does that help? Thanks so much for dealing with this!!
