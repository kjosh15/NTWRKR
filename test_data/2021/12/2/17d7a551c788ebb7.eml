Rian,

Had a great call with Carol yesterday (and am seeing a definite through
line for the kind of people you employ/work with - makes me even more
excited to take the course!) She's going to send me some info on a couple
different customers she has that she thinks would make a great starting
point for us exploring working together.

She did mention she'd like to do either pilot for free. Was that your
intention for the initial launch?

All best,
Josh
