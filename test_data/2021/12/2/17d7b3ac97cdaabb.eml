Brilliant. Some of Roberto Verganti=E2=80=99s behavioral frameworks can be =
readily
codified and embedded into the platform. For example
<https://hbr.org/2016/01/the-innovative-power-of-criticism>, Verganti has
already defined the action statements for innovation. This means we can
provide a data backbone to:


   - Allow Adidas to embed its cultural language into day to day life,
   often driven by history,
   - Provide data on language or concepts that are not landing or are being
   rejected by employees,
   - Share rituals and language in a distributed and flexible way. (I.e.,
   in a framework that allows individuals to match their identity with the
   organization=E2=80=99s purpose),
   - Embed the lateral future vision and strategy by codifying the
   frameworks referenced,
   - Produce data on which parts of the framework employees are finding
   easy, and which are not. (For focussed comms and training support),
   - Link purpose to individual behaviors, and individual behaviors to KPIs=
.


Let us know if we can be helpful in that conversation directly!

- J
