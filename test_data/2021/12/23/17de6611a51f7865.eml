I don=E2=80=99t know either as I didn=E2=80=99t see it, but if it didn=E2=
=80=99t make sense
hopefully you were both entertained, and if it did hopefully you=E2=80=99ll=
 have a
good conversation. :)

Thanks so much to Erla; we left some chocolates for your family on your
front step the other day and only later realized I may have frozen them to
the spot - I trust it all worked out.

Wishing you all the best out there; looking forward to reconnecting in the
new year!! What are you reading?
