Joshua,

FWIW, as of mid afternoon Mark (next door) said we have about 75 cm of snow -=
 AND - it=E2=80=99s still snowing. I drove to town this afternoon and it was=
 quite a rodeo. Made it fine with 4 wheel drive the whole way. I passed 2 sn=
ow plows coming out this way on my way in. Boy, was the ride home - at least=
 to the WA/OR border, where they stop plowing - a piece of cake compared to g=
oing in.=20

Regarding the web site(s): We own KarenKleinArt.com, AGoodDay.today and The-=
Klein=E2=80=99s.US. We should/will give up The-Zkleons.US. Your mother would=
 like to keep KarenKleinArt.com and our e-mail is directed to AGoodDay.today=
.=20

At HostMySite =E2=80=9CAGoodDay.today=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Cpointed to=E2=80=9D=
 KarenKleinArt.com. I believe this has caused some of our difficulties. If -=
 for now, at least - if we can, we should set up AGoodDay.today as our prima=
ry URL and point KarenKleinArt.com to it (rather than vice versa). We can pu=
t up a page, =E2=80=9CComing Soon=E2=80=9D or something similar to create a w=
eb site. Make sense? You will likely have to call HostMySite to figure out h=
ow you get AGoodDay.today moved to MediaTemple. HostMySite does not =E2=80=9C=
own=E2=80=9D AGoodDay.today. It is held by GoDAddy, whom we pay USD$25/year f=
or the URL.=20

Let me know if I can help to move this forward.=20

Love,
DAD
