Joshua,

I bought the url from GoDAddy but it is maintained by HostMySite - not as a s=
eparate url, but pointed to KarenKleinArt.com. I have tried to =E2=80=9Cfind=
=E2=80=9D AGoodDay.today from a browser and it goes nowhere. I don=E2=80=99t=
 know how to interpret this.=20

I can call HostMySite and see what=E2=80=99s needed to get this url and move=
 it to MediaTemple. I=E2=80=99ll let you know what I learn.=20

Since your mother wants to not loose KarnKleinArt.com, but doesn=E2=80=99t w=
ant to set up or maintain a web site right now, I guess we can point it at A=
GoodDay.today OR set it up as =E2=80=9CSite Under Construction=E2=80=9D. You=
r thoughts?

Again, a happy healthy- successful x New Year to you, Hulda and the boys.=20=


Love,
DAD
