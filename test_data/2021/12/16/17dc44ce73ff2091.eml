Thanks Josh but we recently sent you a package that contains the Birkenstock=
s you suggested for Hulda, as well as a gift for you.  Perhaps you can relab=
el the dress gift from you to her.  Could you let us know what you bought fo=
r the kids in our name as well as how much we owe you.

I=E2=80=99ve really enjoyed you and Joel working so closely together on your=
 contract.  It=E2=80=99s great seeing you be so close.

Thank you, thank you to Hulda and you for the 2 camisoles.  I was badly in n=
eed of new ones and it makes me happy that they came from you two.

Lots of love,

Mom
