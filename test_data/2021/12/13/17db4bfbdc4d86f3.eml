Hi Josh - I did hear back from the Katzenbach team - they were saying that
it appears to be an individual assessment with a hint towards
organizational implications.

If the approach would assess groups, teams, and enterprise level dynamics,
they would be more interested in chatting. Maybe we can circle back in
January.

All the best,
John

it. <br><br>Do you know who we could/should reach out to regarding that kin=
