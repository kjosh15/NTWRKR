It's Robert Hentschel, as mentioned. Send it to me to give to the lawyer to
give to the CEO. My impression is that you should write it to the CEO as if
you don't know for sure if they're doing an EV (but presume they are) and
have some ideas for them. I'll position it as very timely given what I
heard from the lawyer, and he can pass it over from there. So don't mention
the lawyer or me, and we'll do the passing as an attachment. Sound good?
