I know we've gone over this before, but what about once a week asking five
questions about the companies' value set itself (treating the company as a
separate individual). Do this in a way that compares new potential values /
behaviors with existing values / behaviors to create a differential. What
people consider to be more important - or what generates a stronger
response - is how you're going to figure out when you need to rewrite the
new values as indicated by the population.

Is that possible? I'm trying to think through what the
fastest/easiest/cheapest way to test ongoing iterative input to move values
through the Data to Action process is!
