Thanks Josh
My hunch was also to build an iterative dialogue with the team and that the
dance of vision and belonging would be / should be carefully entwined.
Thank you for articulating this better for me!
Nothing more to do now while the last couple of weeks roll by. I=E2=80=99m
confirmed starting on the 12th so pretty focussed on my first weeks in
front of the team and meeting stakeholders around the company. As soon as I
have a new email address and admin set up we can start getting into detail
Wishing you all a great festive period and looking forward to seeing you in
2022.
Best regards,
Tom
