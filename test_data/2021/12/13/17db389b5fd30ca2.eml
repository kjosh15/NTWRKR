Still at #1. Want to come for a visit? I've included the view from my
office window as a sample.

Was wondering if you'd be up for another call; we've been asked to pitch on
M&A to two potential buyers and to discuss further with three others in Jan.

Let me know if you have any time, and hope you're doing well!!

All best,
Josh
