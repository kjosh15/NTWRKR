Thanks for the call - and glad to hear *someone* is enjoying good weather..=
.

Here's the details on the opportunity we discussed:

We're creating a consortium of 5-8 companies to work together on DE&I,
using real, strong, validated data to provide accountability and insight -
instead of just pushing out more press releases as fodder for activist
investors. I was impressed with your approach to the topic and thought it
might be a good fit for the solutions you're exploring. Some details:


   - We're already working with the biggest construction firm in the US,
   are talking to one of the biggest handset manufacturers, are scheduled t=
o
   speak with one of the top two beauty brands, and are waiting to hear bac=
k
   from one of the top three petrochemical companies to give a good
   cross-industry view.

   - We're also working with Wharton's People Analytics lab and expect
   their leading DE&I professor to participate in the project, providing
   feedback on best practices, experiment design, and data analytics.

   - The idea is that each company invests $250k to cover development and
   management costs:

   - Indigometrics will provide integration and analytics on up to 2,000
      employees the first year, with a scale-up option for up to 5,000
employees
      the second year. ($35/person total over 24 months.)

      - Indigometrics will also develop dashboard, analytics, and features
      as required to support the effort.

      - All the data will remain the property of the respective companies,
      with all learnings shared equally between each.

      - Finally, World 50's DE&I group (currently ~400 companies) is also
   interested, so this is a chance to help shape a potentially very large
   accountability platform.


I've included our platform's overview deck, or you can check out the quick
video on our site <https://www.indigometrics.com> to get an idea of what we
do. Most of all, if there's interest let me know and I'm happy to walk you
through the platform and talk through what we think we could do with it
together.

Looking forward,
Josh
