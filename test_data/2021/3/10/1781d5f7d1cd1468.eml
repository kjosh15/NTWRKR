This is awesome advice, Josh! I'm on All Raise's newsletter somehow and
haven't been paying close attention to it. Thanks for taking time to reach
out to Megan for me.

Since we last spoke, it feels like it's been years. I started two new
projects that have me switching mind space for a moment. One is to help
Riot Games design a new global ethics and governance process, which is very
interesting as the gaming world is foreign to me; and I feel very grateful
to practice another skill set that will helpful make me a better advisor to
orgs planning on a global expansion one day. The other is to advise AKQA's
SF office on an internal culture initiative.

I figured that I will take on assignments that pay me to learn and expand
my skill set (in service of the bigger fund goal). The other track is that
I'm considering FT positions that would give me additional experience
sharpening my business skills to be a better fund manager / business
advisor.

I thought you might find this amusing - I caught up with Samy Kamkar whom I
hadn't spoken to in a while. I floated the fund idea by him, and he was
basically like - *umm... I don't understand. I don't know the funding
space, but why do you need different tracks to do that? Or to build extra
credibility? You have enough info. Why don't you just start? *

I heard your voice in that. Josh, thank you for helping me stay accountable
to making progress on this.

And you??? What's up with you?
