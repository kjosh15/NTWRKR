Thanks again for the call yesterday; as ever, you came with great questions
and it was tons of fun to connect.

Let me know how/if I can help answer the inquiry from the Digital group
about "metrics for sustaining vs. disruptive innovation," or otherwise be
of any help. I'm really looking forward to seeing what you do with the
Innovation group going forward - I'm happy to connect and brainstorm any
time!

All best wishes,
Josh
