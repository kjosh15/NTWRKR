<br>Really glad we spoke the other day - I think I have a really good lead.=
 <br><br>I spoke on Friday with <a href=3D"https://www.mediapost.com/public=
ations/article/356564/fortune-editor-adam-lashinsky-steps-down-after-n.html=
" target=3D"_blank">Adam Lashinsky</a>, the former editor-in-chief of Fortu=
ne who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve =
been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely e=
xpanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re structured into i=
nterest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc. <br><br>I pitche=
d the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each group to creat=
e a series of insights to share across all the groups and he loved it. He w=
as very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50 had been talki=
ng about doing, but was much more practical than what he had considered (wh=
ich was focused on interviewing outside experts). <br><br>There are issues =
- World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t=
 completely clear on what their approach to media is going forward. Adam as=
ked for some time to socialize this internally, and there is no guarantee t=
hey&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it=
 using internal resources. (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br><br>That=
 said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested t=
o Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said that would be super h=
elpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups=
 tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and woul=
d love to put this idea to him then.<br><br>What do you think? If you&#39;r=
e game, I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine)=
, a work process breakdown, and some # references for Gilded. <br><br>Let m=
e know what you think!<br><br>- J<br><br><br>P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concer=
n is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that would be required to i=
nterface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with the representat=
ives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I wo=
uld be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all this so you can keep=
 it in mind for pricing!<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-mark" style=3D"m=
