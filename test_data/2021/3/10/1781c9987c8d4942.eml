Hi Josh,

Good to hear from you. I am back in Munich now. I worked from here for =
NY all summer. We couldn't agree on a new role back in Europe and I am =
currently wrapping up my time at IDEO. I am leaving at the end of the =
month. I=E2=80=99ll take some time to think about and get read for =
what=E2=80=99s next.

Best for now.
