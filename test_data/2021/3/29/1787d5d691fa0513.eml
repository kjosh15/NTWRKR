No worries! GSuite isn't set up yet (another early task for you?) For now
you can access it at webmail.indigometrics.com. Instrux for email on
whatever client you're using are here
<https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643630/using-email>.

I'm super, super excited to sit down with ya'll Thursday and map out next
steps. I've had calls with three different good friends (who did
Wikipedia's back end, designed the Chef deployment tool, and built out
Etsy's infrastructure, respectively) and gotten a ton of advice on next
steps. The good news is it all seems pretty straight forward and very, very
additive. You should get a TON of practical experience off the back of this
that'll be foundational for whatever we build next. :)

BTW, I believe I put the invite to the slack channel in your @indigometrics
email, but if not here's the link
