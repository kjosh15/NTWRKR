Good to hear from you! Hope all's well on the home front; it's a crazy time
for parents IMHO.

Things here are good (ish); another couple feet of snow last night throwing
a wrench in our plans, plus said parents are looking to visit. I'm still
pushing my kids' old school teacher to find the other Arlo so I can get the
whole kit shipped over here, but otherwise am pretty heads down on
Indigometrics.com; we've just hired our first two employees and I'm trying
to build a board so we can aim squarely at acquisition sooner rather than
later. That may involve taking angel funding, so it's crazy times.

Otherwise Iceland had a resurgence of Covid (the British variant) so
everything is locked down. :P

How's things with you otherwise? You get your barn doors fixed? Working on
any other cool projects?
