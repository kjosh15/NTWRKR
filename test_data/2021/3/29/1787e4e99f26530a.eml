Kehinde, Rossie, Josh

Alright, my NFT Dream Team.

Josh, I know you house sat for Kehinde, lord, almost 20 years ago, but I
forget if you ever met personally. Thanks for assisting with this. Rosie,
who is also cc'd here is Kehinde's studio manager. Obviously, Kehinde has
the vision for this and will connect the dots for you as far as the idea,
number of NFTs, form, etc... As you mention in your email (pertinent text
below), letting everyone know how selling through different formats works,
and since you mention the Wild West any specific risks or restrictions
associated with each format would help too.

Kehinde and Rosie, I have known Josh since high school. You can find his
resume at https://www.josh.is/ if you are interested. He has been at the
forefront of various waves of technology for a few decades now, just look
at his client list. I also can't resist adding his crow vending machine Ted
talk:
https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_a_thought_experiment_on_the_intelligence_of_crows?language=en#t-572679

Kehinde, why don't you give Josh an idea of the vision and scope of what
you are thinking to get the conversation started. And if you don't mind, I
would love to stay on the email thread in the background if that is
alright, to see how this unfolds and helps Black Rock mainly, and NFTs are
a space I have been curious about too. Equally, let me know if I can help
in any other way too.

*Email: We do indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him when we first moved
to NYC (thanks to you!) and have a picture framed of ourselves of a day we
took his dogs out for a walk. It's our "epitome of NY experience" photo,
with a bagel shop in the background and everything. ;) Glad to hear he's
still doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.If he'd like to connect
his timing is good. I've been working with a friend who is currently doing
a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we'd been predicting NFTs
for a while - we realized we were on the right track when he had to rescue
a friend of theirs' who had his credentials on a $200k NFT stolen because
he set up his security wrong!If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to
sell NFTs I can certainly help, although he ought to figure out if he wants
to sell via personal brand, gallery, or reseller first. It's very much the
wild west ATM so he's wise to get ahead of it before regulators (or
galleries) do!Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I
can do to help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans,
or some other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!Much love back
at you,Josh*
