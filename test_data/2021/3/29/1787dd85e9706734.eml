From: Josh Klein <josh@josh.is>=20
Sent: 29 March 2021 12:24

Subject: Welcome Email

Let me know if you have any edits/suggestions on the below:

=20

###

=20

Welcome to Indigometrics!! We're thrilled to have you as a part of the =
team. Indigometrics is a company dedicated to improving work, and as =
such your voice is a critical one in shaping who we are and the impact =
we'll have together.=20

# Overvew:

Starting a new role can be daunting, so we wanted to give you some idea =
of what to expect as you onboard. Note that you're among our very first =
employees, so this process isn't well defined (or defined at all?) yet! =
We'd really appreciate your feedback about how to improve it as we go =
along.=20


# First Day (April 1): We've scheduled a bunch of meetings so you have =
time to connect with Chris, myself, with each other, and with the whole =
team. Feel free to ask questions throughout - we don't expect you to =
know anything going in, so the more you ask the better we can help you =
find your feet! We'll try to keep this day short; especially in a =
distributed environment it's easy to get signal overload. We would =
rather have you itching with ideas of things to dig into than crushed =
under a stack of stuff to metabolize!=20


# First Day Agenda: I've drawn up a rough agenda for our first all-hands =
team meeting below. Again, this is really informal because the team is =
still so small and because we really are looking for your feedback!

1.	Does everyone know what success means for their role? Any questions? =
Can you tell us what it is in your own words and do you feel comfortable =
with it? The purpose here is to make sure you're completely clear on how =
to succeed and feel in control in achieving it!
2.	When is a good time for a second meeting to discuss OKRs =
(https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and when can we set a =
calendar date to revisit these quarterly?
3.	When is best to schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else =
over the next few weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's =
going? This is just a support call to make sure you're getting what you =
need to feel successful.
4.	Let's talk through the tools and processes everyone has found works =
well for them!
5.	Let's talk briefly about the company policies and values; this is =
core to who we are. What is needed?
6.	There is no welcome packet, yet: what was missing from the process so =
far?



# Company policies and values: Indigometrics was created because Chris =
and I had looked at where technology was headed and saw a potential =
disaster in the way data was being collected and used to manage people - =
and at the same time a huge opportunity. We wanted to make the world a =
better place by empowering people to make work better, for everyone.

The result is Indigometrics. As you work more closely with the platform =
you'll spend a lot of time thinking about values (which is a good =
thing!) and what behaviors embody them. For Indigometrics, our values =
are:

Respect: Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself

Work Better: Focus on the outcome (not the task), work smarter (not =
longer), and improve continuously

Creativity: Look for, and implement, creative solutions that create =
compound value

Consider: Consider the impact of our actions on all parties

Curiosity: Explore the entire world and its challenges. Solutions and =
opportunities are everywhere!

Longevity: Leave the world a better place


One of the key things we've learned from Indigometrics so far is that no =
group of people is static, and so neither are their values. If you see =
something that's missing or misaligned in the weeks and months ahead, =
please bring it up! The more we're all thinking these things through the =
better Indigometrics will be able to achieve its goals, and that =
includes making changes to say aligned with who we become together.

As for policies, we don't have any yet. You can help here!


# Summary:

I think that's it. I swore to myself that I wouldn't write a massive =
book to introduce you to the company, so clearly I've got some work to =
do going forward. Again, please know we're enormously grateful to have =
you as a part of the company and couldn't be happier to have you on =
board as we build Indigometrics to improve the world. Get ready - this =
is going to be fun!

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
CEO, Indigometrics
