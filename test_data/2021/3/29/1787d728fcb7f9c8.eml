Scott!! So good to hear from you; I've often thought about you over the
past decade and meant to write also - thanks for reaching out!

Things here are good; Hulda and I are still together, have two boys, and
recently moved from Queens to Iceland (because: pandemic). We're currently
living the country life in a big rambling farmhouse. Life is good.

Excellent to hear about LSU and you finding a good place. I'm super curious
about Senegal (we've always wanted to go!) and am delighted to hear about
your textiles work; send a link when you get a chance!

So sorry to hear about your accident; I never heard about it but completely
understand about falling off the planet given the circumstances!! Very very
glad to hear you seem to have made a complete recovery.

We do indeed know Kehinde; we house-sat for him when we first moved to NYC
(thanks to you!) and have a picture framed of ourselves of a day we took
his dogs out for a walk. It's our "epitome of NY experience" photo, with a
bagel shop in the background and everything. ;) Glad to hear he's still
doing great work; Blackrock sounds amazing.

If he'd like to connect his timing is good. I've been working with a friend
who is currently doing a bunch of crypto for the Winklevoss twins and we'd
been predicting NFTs for a while - we realized we were on the right track
when he had to rescue a friend of theirs' who had his credentials on a
$200k NFT stolen because he set up his security wrong!

If Kekinde wants to get set up securely to sell NFTs I can certainly help,
although he ought to figure out if he wants to sell via personal brand,
gallery, or reseller first. It's very much the wild west ATM so he's wise
to get ahead of it before regulators (or galleries) do!

Feel free to connect us directly, and let me know what else I can do to
help. Otherwise I hope to see you again in Iceland, New Orleans, or some
other place in the year ahead for a proper catch-up!!

Much love back at you,
Josh
