###

Welcome to Indigometrics!! We're thrilled to have you as a part of the
team. Indigometrics is a company dedicated to improving work, and as such
your voice is a critical one in shaping who we are and the impact we'll
have together.

*# Overvew:*

Starting a new role can be daunting, so we wanted to give you some idea of
what to expect as you onboard. Note that you're among our very first
employees, so this process isn't well defined (or defined at all?) yet!
We'd really appreciate your feedback about how to improve it as we go
along.


*# First Day (April 1):* We've scheduled a bunch of meetings so you have
time to connect with Chris, myself, with each other, and with the whole
team. Feel free to ask questions throughout - we don't expect you to know
anything going in, so the more you ask the better we can help you find your
feet! We'll try to keep this day short; especially in a distributed
environment it's easy to get signal overload. We would rather have you
itching with ideas of things to dig into than crushed under a stack of
stuff to metabolize!


*# First Day Agenda:* I've drawn up a rough agenda for our first all-hands
team meeting below. Again, this is really informal because the team is
still so small and because we really are looking for your feedback!


   1. Does everyone know what success means for their role? Any questions?
   Can you tell us what it is in your own words and do you feel comfortable
   with it? The purpose here is to make sure you're completely clear on how=
 to
   succeed and feel in control in achieving it!

   2. When is a good time for a second meeting to discuss OKRs (
   https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and when can we set a
   calendar date to revisit these quarterly?

   3. When is best to schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else
   over the next few weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's goin=
g?
   This is just a support call to make sure you're getting what you need to
   feel successful.

   4. Let's talk through the tools and processes everyone has found works
   well for them!

   5. Let's talk briefly about the company policies and values; this is
   core to who we are. What is needed?

   6. There is no welcome packet, yet: what was missing from the process so
   far?



*# Company policies and values:* Indigometrics was created because Chris
and I had looked at where technology was headed and saw a potential
disaster in the way data was being collected and used to manage people -
and at the same time a huge opportunity. We wanted to make the world a
better place by empowering people to make work better, for everyone.

The result is Indigometrics. As you work more closely with the platform
you'll spend a lot of time thinking about values (which is a good thing!)
and what behaviors embody them. For Indigometrics, our values are:

*Respect*: Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself
*Work Better*: Focus on the outcome (not the task), work smarter (not
longer), and improve continuously
*Creativity*: Look for, and implement, creative solutions that create
compound value
*Consider*: Consider the impact of our actions on all parties
*Curiosity*: Explore the entire world and its challenges. Solutions and
opportunities are everywhere!
*Longevity*: Leave the world a better place


One of the key things we've learned from Indigometrics so far is that no
group of people is static, and so neither are their values. If you see
something that's missing or misaligned in the weeks and months ahead,
please bring it up! The more we're all thinking these things through the
better Indigometrics will be able to achieve its goals, and that includes
making changes to say aligned with who we become together.

As for policies, we don't have any yet. You can help here!


*# Summary:*

I think that's it. I swore to myself that I wouldn't write a massive book
to introduce you to the company, so clearly I've got some work to do going
forward. Again, please know we're enormously grateful to have you as a part
of the company and couldn't be happier to have you on board as we build
Indigometrics to improve the world. Get ready - this is going to be fun!

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
CEO, Indigometrics
