What's the timestamp you'd expect it at so we can look more closely? As for
a post-mount, it really depends on what you've got handy (home depot, a
nail and a pole, etc.!) A spiked 4x4 ought to do it if you can get it set
solidly enough - sometimes corvids can land pretty solidly!!

All best,
Josh
