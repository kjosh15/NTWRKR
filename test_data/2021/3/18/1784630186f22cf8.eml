My Accenture podcast is due out April 15th. The only social platform I'm
active on (really at all) is LinkedIn; do you have any tips on how to use
these two assets to drive attention to IndigoMetrics / my consulting?

Really appreciate any/all advice!! And totally suggest podcasting; super
fun stuff!!!

Hope you're doing well,
Josh
