Hello, Josh!

Good to hear from you. Hope you and family are all well and safe. Family
has probably grown some since we last worked together.

You've got some incredible projects there, that's awesome.

My days are spent working part-time with Thank God It's Natural
<https://thankgoditsnatural.com/>, a natural hair care product company
based in Chicago, another part-time position in Cast scheduling with Disney
Reservation Center and being available to assist my mom at home. All of
these keep me super busy.

I'm looking forward to some traveling as soon as things ease up a bit. Sure
do miss that. How was/is Iceland?

Best wishes to everyone, and if I can ever help with some administrative
tasks, feel free to reach out.

Take care!

Karen Wood
