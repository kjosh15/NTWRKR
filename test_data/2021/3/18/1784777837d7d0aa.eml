Joshua,

I printed the docs and your signature looks reproduced (it looks like 
the scan on your end was at a low resolution). If you'd like, I can sign 
your name and add my initials and date. This is - for most documents - a 
legal means of signing. To be safe, send me an email authorizing me to 
sign for you in the matter of your organizing your LLC in Wyoming. I'll 
include this in the packet if you'd like.

FWIW, your mother is leaving here ~9:00AM for a hearing appointment, so 
if you do this early your time, she can go by the P.O. while in town 
tomorrow.

Love, DAD
