Can you please mail the following documents:

- Certified copies of articles of organization
- Certificate of existence/good standing
- Wyoming Articles of Domestication (including signed registered agent
consent form) ATTACHED
- Resolution to Domesticate ATTACHED
- Dissolution form (Unfiled, for reference) ATTACHED

to Wyoming at:

Wyoming Secretary of State
Herschler Building East, Suite 101
122 W 25th Street
Cheyenne, WY 82002-0020

and include:

Happy to pay you back via Venmo or however suits best. Please make sure
that when you print out the attached documents they're as clear as possible
- they wanted original signatures which isn't possible, so the less they
look printed the better...

Very much obliged!!

love,
Josh
