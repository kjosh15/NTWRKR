Brilliant! I'm heads-down on IndigoMetrics; we just hired two people and
I'm working on a consortium to solve for D&I using data.

Stoked to hear about Glimrandi!! Would love to brainstorm, but Othinn got a
stomach flu and I've got nine zoom calls scheduled for today. Are you
available in the morning mid-next week?

All best wishes,
Josh
