David, Kevin, Misha, Jim,

 

Reporting on launch day stats:

 

*	512 reviews were sent out and 124 (24%) were completed
This is a good launch day result given the VPN access problems that started
around an hour after launch. Average launch day completion is approx. 25%
but varies widely depending on the comms package used prior to launch.
*	41% of reviews were "I did not interact"
This is higher than expected (we expect 30% on launch day) and probably
reflects the disperse nature of the teams involved in the launch. This
figure will reduce as our platform learns and also when we get the planned
API access to your SAP data (because we will be able to code in a better
understanding of your org structure). We will also increase the weighting
given to the MS Graph People API Relevance Score to tailor our pair matching
algorithm to Bechtel's environment. 
*	9 contact enquiries dealt with
6 of these related to the VPN issue as below. 2 were questions about how the
platform works and 1 participant asked not to be involved because they only
joined Bechtel a few months ago (we have put a 3 month hold on their
participation)
*	VPN access challenges
It looks like the main VPN used by Bechtel employees started blocking the
site about an hour after the launch email was sent, review traffic dropped
off significantly after that.
The platform automatically sends a reminder email to anyone who hasn't
completed their review 48 hours after the first email. If our site can be
white listed on the Bechtel VPN before those emails go out (tomorrow) we
could add text to that email such as "We understand that you may have
experienced problems accessing the Indigometrics site on Thursday. This was
due to a VPN blocking access, the Indigometrics site has now been white
listed and you shouldn't experience any similar challenges going forward"
We would then also propose to add a similar message to the emails sent with
the 2nd reviews sent next Thursday to build back confidence that the site
will be available.

 

Happy to discuss in more detail - and please let us know if we can help at
all with the VPN white listing.

 

Thanks and regards

 

Chris
