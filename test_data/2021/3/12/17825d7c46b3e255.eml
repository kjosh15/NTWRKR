Can you clarify on proofs of address? I ask as I believe I can only get one
bill from the cell/internet provider (Vodafone) - all other utilities are
wrapped into the rent. I can also pull an Iceland gov't doc, but not sure
it'll be accepted by your man. Let me know if you've any ideas, otherwise
I'll pull them and we can just try.

Finally, I'm assuming that using my US passport is best, for tax purposes?
Or with that in mind would the Icelandic actually be better?

All best,
Josh
