Will do. Let me know if you're looking for content ideas, speakers,
potential new members, RL experiences, or anything else and I'll gladly
send you ideas as I come on them!

The thing I'm most excited about for World 50 is the podcast. It echoes
what I've been hearing from executives since the pandemic began, which is
that members would like more insights at less attentional cost. Podcasts
fit that perfectly, providing a chance for members to have a voice across
the groups while reinforcing the World 50 brand.

All best,
Josh
