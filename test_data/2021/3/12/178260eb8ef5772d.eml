I have another angle for us to look at; my friend Jordan Harbinger
<https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jordan-harbinger-show/id13449996=
19>
(whose show has "over six million downloads each month and 250,000
downloads per episode as of 2020" as per wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Harbinger>) has offered to pitch me
to his contact who sold his services to Microsoft for a podcasting deal.
Apparently she's an agent who locates podcasts and related talent for big
orgs.

Again, no idea what the worth of that is, but figured that if we could make
a Future of Work pitch it's another place to validate the pitch and perhaps
get some access. Let me know if my ignorance is showing here - I'm eager to
get everything lined up to leverage the release of The Big Change!

All best,
Josh

had been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had =
considered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts). <br><br>The=
re are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructuring, =
and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to media is going fo=
rward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, and there is =
no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll t=
ry to build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is unlikely=
.)<br><br>That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally.=
 I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said that wo=
uld be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of =
ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 =
years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br><br>What do you think=
? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture po=
dcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.=
 <br><br>Let me know what you think!<br><br>- J<br><br><br>P.S. Adam&#39;s =
biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that would be=
 required to interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with t=
he representatives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He also=
 asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all this s=
o you can keep it in mind for pricing!<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-ma=
