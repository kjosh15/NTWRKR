Gustavo,

Thanks! All fingers crossed. Here's celebrating your future success also!

Right now I'm only available at 9am EST for 30m (that's my fourth call of
the day, followed by six *more* back-to-back zoom calls!) Let me know if
you can make that work, otherwise I'll go back to the calendar to see what
else I can open up.

In the meanwhile, I'll send you an updated shipping label for the books to
ship Monday; let me know if there's anything you want to keep/buy in the
meantime.

The address my bank sent checks to was:

HUSA 8283Q, LLC
PO Box 20058 Greeley Sq Station
4 East 27th St.
New York, NY 10001

That's how it was written as best as I can tell. On the check we listed
"B42" and an account number (no longer valid).

AFAIK that should reach them; maybe you can send the next check certified
mail to make certain it is received? Otherwise maybe just make sure that
the full apartment address is on the check. My guess is they're holding on
to all the checks in hopes that legislation turns in their favor - that
said, they've GOT the checks, which is some protection to you I would think=
!

All best,
Josh
