Ashley,

Just received payment but noted it as being for Invoice #69, Issued Oct 1,
2020. Was this actually intended for invoice #70 issued Jan 1, 2021, and if
so did my accounting service miss payment for invoice #69?

Not urgent, but wanted to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks.

All best,
Josh
