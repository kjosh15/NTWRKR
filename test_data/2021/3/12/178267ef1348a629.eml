*TL;DR: Know any big companies eager to solve for DE&I?*

After nearly three months of digging through VC financing options it looks
like we've accidentally ruined our chances by being profitable. We're now
facing either raising from an angel at a not-great valuation, or generating
up-front revenue through a consortium. The idea here is that 4-8 companies
put in $250k each, we bring in the head DE&I person from Wharton's People
Analytics team to help coordinate, and then as a team we attack the DE&I
problem over two years using the Indigometrics platform to validate,
metric, and track.

The outcome will be serious numbers around what does and doesn't improve
DE&I outcomes across industry verticals, which ought to be a huge stake in
the ground - both for those companies (and ours) but also for what actual
DE&I measures entail going forward.

It's super exciting, but it requires some brave (and big) companies to sign
on. We've got the biggest US construction firm already in, and are talking
to the biggest US handset manufacturer, the biggest US paint distributor,
and one of the top-three beauty brands in the world. Know anyone else who
might be interested?

*TL;DR: Do you know of any companies that would benefit from a Future of
Work podcast? *

My podcast with Accenture is proving to be super, super fun, and while
consulting is still a mainstay for intermediate cash flow (until we get
Indigometrics to the point of paying us a salary!) I'd love to do another.
My main topic is the future of work, and I'm keen to pitch the idea of a
branded podcast. Any ideas are appreciated!

*TL;DR: Let me know how to provide more value with these updates!*

I'm continuing to experiment with formats, but am keenly aware that your
time is precious. Let me know if the above is interesting, if
bullet-pointed lists are more useful, and/or what you might find
interesting valuable from me on a bi-weekly basis.

Gratefully,
Josh
