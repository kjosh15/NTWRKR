Hi Josh,

I hope that you are doing great!

I just wanted to quickly follow up on sponsoring the Wharton People
Analytics Conference. I know that it can take some time to review the
packages that I shared, but I wanted to see if you had any questions at all
that I could answer.

The whole conference team is extremely excited about the prospect of
potentially having the Indigometrics team as a sponsor!

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with -- we would
love to start marketing Indigometrics as a sponsor as soon as possible!

Best,
Nathan
