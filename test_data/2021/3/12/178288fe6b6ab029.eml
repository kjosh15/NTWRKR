 add one name. <br /><br />As another option, you may choose to upgrade=
 your account to the standard plan (this comes with 2 additional recipie=

 per additional user. An additional user will have their own digital inb=
ox with their own unique login credentials. All mail addressed to an add=
itional user will show up in their personal inbox.<br /><br />You may al=
so add additional recipients. Each plan comes with a set number of addit=
ional recipients that may be added to the account at no additional charg=
e. A recipient does not have their own digital inbox and does not have t=
heir own login credentials; they will share login credentials with the m=
ain account holder. All mail addressed to additional recipients will sho=
w up in the main account holder's inbox.<br /><br />She will also need t=
