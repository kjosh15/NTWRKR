Are we using AWS WAF, or any other security services? They may well have
more stringent limits by default. Can we verify that the error that's
received by the client is a HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden)? That would
help verify it's AWS WAF that's doing the limiting (or otherwise help
debug).

I'm looking up testing tools so we can determine if WE can hit high levels
of requests to the IP in question (and thereby verify the problem is/isn't
on our end.)

Our clients use Zscaler exclusively, so their traffic is going to either be
going over Zscaler ZPA or Zscaler ZIA.
