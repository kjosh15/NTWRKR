For three days now I've been trying to update my account with information
on my business account at Capital One, but each time it says "Account
Refreshed!" and then immediately changes to "Account Needs Attention" or
"Data can't refresh right now. We can't update your Capital One - Banking
data right now. Let's try again later."

I need to get my business expenses so I can submit my taxes in time to file
internationally; I'm facing huge fees if I can't get this solved
immediately. Help??

Many thanks,
Josh
