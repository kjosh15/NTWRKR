Are you the right person to ask about this?

I'm looking to get my publicity outreach set up in advance of the podcast
release; do we have any guidance on what we want distributed, estimated
numbers of listeners, platforms the podcast will be on, podcasts excerpts
will appear on, URLs we'd like interested parties funneled to, etc.?

Very much obliged!
Josh
