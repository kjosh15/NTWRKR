Ha!! That's the Sm=C3=A1ri I know and love. Well said, and well articulated=
...
although I'm still waiting for a solution?

The sad truth is that we're watching with great anticipation to see how the
next ruling on education comes out as it will set the tone for the next ten
years - which is when our kids will be in school. We're fortunate in that
we understand virtual solutions and have flexibility in exploiting them,
but... in the meantime it's quite a mess.

One last point of interest is that when you speak of underfunding I see
nothing of the sort - compared to the USA. Your comment made me sit back
and re-evaluate, and on reflection there is indeed significant room for
investment.

Curious to see what comes,
Josh
