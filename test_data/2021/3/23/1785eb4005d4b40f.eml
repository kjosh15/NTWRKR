Tryggvi,

Such a pleasure talking today - we didn't have time to get into it, but one
of the first things I did in the pandemic was to create an outreach
campaign to identify and reconnect with people who were strongly values led
(and with whose values I shared). The goal was to create a broader network
of very aligned connections and to reduce interactions with those who
weren't motivated similarly. So I think we're looking to spend our time
similarly.

1. Local school: please do send the framework you've been working on
locally and I'll use it to investigate the willingness of our incoming
principle to make changes. If we can make a role as that "warm blanket of
support" you mentioned this may be a good place to drive change.

2. Indigometrics.com: this is my B2B SaaS platform which I'd love to trial
in Iceland for solving corruption. All the material here is very high
level, but it will give you a sense for the potential. I'd love your
thoughts as a data analyst generally, but also:

i. You suggested HR as a means to get access to Icelandic companies, and
FKA as a group that could speak to that community. Do you know anyone in
FKA I could connect to?

ii. You mentioned a new tax framework for R&D that was very favorable.
Right now Indigometrics is based in the UK, but I'd love to move it here!
Do you know who could advise me on this?

iii. It sounds as though Iceland is about to have a rash of new funding
options. We're potentially looking for a $3-5mm raise - do you expect these
new options to have rounds this size?


3. Funds: I know a number of companies, individuals, and PEs who are
looking to expand this year and am talking to Kiddi about how to facilitate
their intro to Kria. Please keep me in mind if you see similar
opportunities elsewhere.

Always happy to set up another call (I'm almost full time EST so mornings
are very open), or to keep communicating via email. Thanks so much for all
the help and consideration!

Kve=C3=B0ja,
Josh

P.S. Some other items we didn't get into:

a) Biohacking: I've done a bunch of activities in this space (mostly around
Quantified Self, habit formation, and performance) but am also waiting to
push this project

(around
Continuous Glucose Monitoring) and am curious what you think. Similarly, do
you know Aubrey De Gray <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey>?

b) You mentioned VR; I'm doing some work with Jaron Lanier
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier> (around pitching a GPT-3
hosted TV series) and recently interviewed Chris Milk
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Milk> (maker of the Supernatural VR
exercise platform) if either would be useful connections.
