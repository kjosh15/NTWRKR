Dear Carl,

Great chatting with you last Friday, as always! I wanted to follow up on
the Indigometrics opportunity.

As mentioned, we're currently working with Wharton's People Analytics team
on a number of fronts. First, they've asked to publish a white paper on our
culture analytics as they see it as outstanding in the field. Secondly, we
are exploring using our platform to validate their Coachability studies due
to our ability to flexibly measure behavior change over time. Thirdly, we
are discussing working with one of their leading D&I professors on a
collaboration to use data to provide measurement and accountability.

We'd love to do a D&I pilot with you as I know you're doing a lot of work
in this area. Based on our conversation, there's a lot of overlap! I've
attached a two-pager highlighting where I see the greatest potential, along
with an overview deck. A short video overview is available at
www.indigometrics.com along with some case studies, etc.

If you could arrange a meeting with the right people I'd love to see if
there's opportunity for a pilot!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
