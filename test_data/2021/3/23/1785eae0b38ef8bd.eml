I've been chatting with Tryggvi Hjaltason about the boys' education issue
(as I have two in school here) and am wondering if you have any connections
or pull with anyone who can help. All I'm trying to do is get conversations
and resources routed appropriately, so not enormous expectations, but it is
a chance to learn about how things get done here.

This is my first (very small) potential foray into Icelandic politics, so
any thoughts/suggestions are welcome!

Much obliged,
Josh
