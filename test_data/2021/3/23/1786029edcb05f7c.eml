Thanks, Beth! And congrats on the move - excited to see where you take off
next.

In terms of the CGM project, I'm trying to figure out if I can launch it as
a consortium or am better off bidding it as a single-client project. My
work for the last decade has given me access to a broad set of senior
executives, so it's not unreasonable to think I could invite the CTOs of
Apple, J&J, and Marsh to the table for a joint effort... but that may just
be signing up for herding cats. Do you have any thoughts?

All best wishes,
Josh
