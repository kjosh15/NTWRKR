Thanks again for the call today; it was enormously helpful just to be able
to bounce these ideas off someone and to get a reality check.

If you have any citations on articles reg. influencing D&I with statistical
data I'd love to see them; you bring up an excellent point and I'm aware
I'm getting push from a less numerate audience!

Many thanks,
Josh
