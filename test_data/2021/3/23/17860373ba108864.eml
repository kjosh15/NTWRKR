Can you give access to Lachlan? He's ready to go, and identified that we
can use AWS to run the regular file drop for us - this shifts more of our
infrastructure onto AWS from our VM, which ultimately reduces risk and
increases scalability.

I also suggested he create a network map as he learns the components in our
system - we need this regardless, and it'll provide a basis for
documentation as we expand / consider revisioning.

On a separate topic, do we need an email for Loreley?

Finally, I've been pulling together a tech stack list for as we onboard and
wanted your feedback:


   - Trello (or equivalent) for PM
   - Slack (paid version for messages retention)
   - Github for source code repository
   - Gitlab for deployment
   - ?? for ongoing AWS Security checks
   - Google Suite for mail + docs
   - DropBox for file exchange


Thoughts?
- J
