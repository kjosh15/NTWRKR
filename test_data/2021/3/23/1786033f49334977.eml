1) Excellent, that's very helpful. Makes a lot of sense, too - especially
if we're going to rely on AWS for services (such as cron equivalents) going
forward. Let's do it for now with the caveat that we need to start
documenting features like this and I'd like you to begin thinking about
how/where we should do that. I'll ping Chris to see WTF you don't have
access yet...

2) Additionally, I'm trying to think through what our corporate tech stack
needs to be for the immediate future. At present I'm suggesting the
following but wanted your feedback:

Trello (or equivalent) for PM
Slack (paid version for messages retention)
Github for source code repository
Gitlab for deployment
?? for ongoing AWS Security checks
Google Suite for mail + docs
DropBox for file exchange

3) April 1 you're going to be drinking from the firehose and I thought we
could capitalize on that as an opportunity to draw up some basic
architecture documentation. I.e., if you could create an infrastructure map
as an excuse to learn what all the components are (and hopefully identify
some gaps) within the company tech that would be enormously helpful. Does
that seem feasible/useful, or would you rather push this off until you've
had a chance to take the lay of the land?

Stoked,
Josh

s got the S3 bucket working, but now we need to get 3 csvs into the bucket =
every night. Essentially we need a bit of code on one of the VMs that hits =
our API, downloads the user logs and puts them in the S3 bucket. You can do=
 it in python using boto3 but perhaps there is a better way? Would be good =
also to have a size reporting feature so we can push the client on times to=
 delete old logs...<br><br>As you&#39;ve signed the employment contract we =
