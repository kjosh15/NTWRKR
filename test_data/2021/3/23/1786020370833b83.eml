Thanks, I'll check it out! And thanks again for the call - it was
ENORMOUSLY helpful. One of my favorite parts of being a CEO now is being
able to talk with crazy smart people such as yourself to help figure things
out. A couple follow ups:

1. Any insights you might have into average amounts of equity for an early
stage company such as mine would be helpful.

2. You mentioned you had a friend who was an attorney with lots of
experience who might be helpful given our space? Always happy to talk to
super smart folks if an introduction would be interesting to her!

3. I'll work on my skills matrix for our board and, if you're still
willing, will run it by you before we start drawing up a short list. We
don't have an ideal exit strategy yet (too many options at our current
stage!) so I'm keen for feedback to help us narrow in on direction.

Very, very much obliged,
Josh

P.S. Let me know when you start looking at houses in Hawaii. ;}
