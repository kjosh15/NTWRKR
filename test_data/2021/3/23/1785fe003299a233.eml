 daily walk we saw lots of green and enjoyed our lunch by the water.=C2=A0 =
There was a Microsoft cultural event on the Teams with a storyteller and we=
 learned the stories of St. Patrick.=C2=A0 For example, when he was here do=
ing his converting, he was known as Patrick the Brit and wore blue almost e=
xclusively.=C2=A0 Also, it is lore that St. Patrick used the shamrock to ex=
plain the Holy Trinity to the Irish although the storyteller pointed out th=
at the Irish already had many examples of three-part religious entities in =
their pagan tradition.=C2=A0 Different plants have been referred to as sham=
rock over time as well. We also learned that leprechauns were fairy shoemak=
ers, the common depiction of them comes from Disney and the bit about the g=
old at the end of the rainbow probably has something to do with Vikings bur=
ying treasure under rock mounds graves and the rainbow being the bridge to =
Valhalla. Although it was a nice and informative St. Paddy=E2=80=99s day, E=
ric and I are really looking forward to seeing a parade and having a Guinne=

 with just a little soreness from different muscle movements and joint posi=
