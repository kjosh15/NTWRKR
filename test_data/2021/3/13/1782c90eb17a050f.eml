Hi Josh,

Thanks so much for your note! I completely understand and thanks for
sharing that with us.

Out of curiosity, is the dollar commitment the reason for not sponsoring
this year? If so, I could definitely put together a sponsorship package as
low as $5K that still has significant value (e.g., 10 tickets would be
included).

Let me know if that might be interesting to you, and I would be happy to
put a package together that reflects that! Thanks so much, Josh!

Best,
Nathan
