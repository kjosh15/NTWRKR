Hi Josh,

Sorry for the late reply, my PSU decided to explode this morning, so I've
been trying to Frankenstein my old laptop back into working order.
Sounds good to me! I'll hop on and have a look but if what I'm assuming is
true turns out to be true, then it won't take me terribly long to code and
get it running, but I'll let you know a time estimate once I've had a look
at the infrastructure in place.

Thanks, and looking forward to working with you!
Lachlan
