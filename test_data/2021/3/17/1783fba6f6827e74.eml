Lachlan,

Chris got the S3 bucket working, but now we need to get 3 csvs into the
bucket every night. Essentially we need a bit of code on one of the VMs
that hits our API, downloads the user logs and puts them in the S3 bucket.
You can do it in python using boto3 but perhaps there is a better way?
Would be good also to have a size reporting feature so we can push the
client on times to delete old logs...

As you've signed the employment contract we are OK on confidentiality; can
I set you up with lachlan.mcwilliam@indigometrics.com so Chris can give you
AWS access to sort it? Could be a good chance to poke around and look at
what's there.

We can pay you by the hour until 1 April, if that works - just give me a
time estimate up front.

Let me know - and welcome to the team!!
Josh
