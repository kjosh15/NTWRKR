Let's read this together; it really reflects what I experienced and I think
it'll be even more relevant to you as you start trying new things and
making bigger projects in the world.

No, I was not paid directly for this job, but it has been worth an enormous
amount to me, most of all as a path to tenure and also future career
opportunities of a broader nature.

I started publishing earlier than most people, with two articles accepted
which I wrote at age nineteen, though it took a while for them to come out.

There I was at George Mason University, an undergraduate, and I figured I
needed to do something to advance my lot.  And I already had the experience
of beating adults at chess at young ages.  So it seemed to me I could
publish something, even if not in the very best journals.

I was also well aware that GMU was specializing in various brands of
Austrian and market-oriented economics, so some portfolio diversification
would not be a bad thing, in part to ensure I would learn other traditions,
and in part to signal that I was interested in them, as indeed was (and
still is) the case.

I had been doing a lot of reading on the Cambridge capital debates, and so
I thought I would try publishing a piece in the *Journal of Post Keynesian
Economics*.  I sent it in, and they took it!  While I had thought this was
possible, I still was quite surprised at the outcome, as it was my very
first submission to a refereed journal.  The piece was "The rate of return
in general equilibrium: a critique," and it focused on the claims of
Christopher Bliss and others that GE models were a successful resolution to
the capital reswitching debates.  Editor Paul Davidson gave me detailed and
excellent comments to help turn it into a publishable piece.

I was aware of course that such pieces would brand me as "not on the
mainstream fast track," but still it seemed like a very good deal to me.

Another area I had been studying was public goods theory, at the original
behest of Walter Grinder, an early inspirational mentor of mine.  So I
wrote up some of my ideas on public goods theory, but put them in a
neo-institutionalist framework, and sent it off to *Review of Social
Economy*, an institutionalist journal.

They accepted the piece too!  Of course I had to respond to the comments
from Reviewer 2, ever-valuable training to this day.  Note that with these
early pieces I received only modest help from GMU faculty at the time.

I also was doing a term paper for a British history class, and I studied
the 17th century British mercantilist Nicholas Barbon, and early advocate
of free trade and also YIMBYism for London, following the Great Fire.  I
turned that into a submission too, and a bit later it was accepted at *Rese=
arch
in the History of Economic Thought and Methodology*, then edited by Warren
Samuels.  That was "Nicholas Barbon and the Origins of Classical
Liberalism," and it contained some of the ideas that later evolved into
state capacity libertarianism.  I recall three referee reports, not just
two, and lots of follow-up work that was required.

My learning from these experiences was pretty simple:

1. I ought to keep on trying and writing more, but aiming higher.

2. My experience with early success in chess was not entirely unique, so of
course this boosted my confidence more generally.

3. Try things, and make people tell you no.  Just keep on trying, in the
most naive "Reader's Digest" sense.  Most people simply won't be doing
that, so it can be a huge comparative advantage.

4. It is worth writing for people with ideas and political viewpoints
different from one's own, and they might have a real interest in what you
are doing, especially if you can become fluent in their languages as well
as your own.

5. I realized I didn't have to grow up "having a chip on my shoulder," as I
saw was the case with many other young libertarians or for that matter
left-wing radicals.  I figured I would and could strike out along a
different path of eclecticism.

6. The publications probably got me get accepted into top graduate schools,
as I was accepted everywhere I applied, basically the top six plus a few
safety schools.  That validated my earlier decision to go to George Mason
as an undergraduate and work on my own, rather than be stuck with more
homework and more conformism at a bigger name university.  I figured that
subsequent "work on my own" decisions might turn out well too, and later
they did.

Here is a chain linking to my earlier posts on other early jobs
<https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/03/my-economics-in-=
argumentation-seminars-job.html>
.

And so that publishing job was to continue for a long time, in conjunction
with my other labors of course...
