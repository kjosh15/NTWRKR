  Gustavo to sell everything in June/July/Aug (doesn't want to sell before
then). He's planning on moving to start a new semester of schooling for
Etukai, but not before.

He has a list of 12 things he'd like to buy before then he'll email me.

In the meantime, he will make list of:

- what he wants to buy outright
- what he wants to buy for now through June
- what he wants to sell now
- what he wants to sell later

Basically I inferred we didn't want to wait until Sept. to sell everything,
so he offered to buy some things he wanted to keep long term and some stuff
he wanted to buy for now and resell himself when he moves.

Let me know if you have any Q's!

xoxo,
Josh
