Got it - this is super useful, and it really sounds like it starts with the
client first.

That said, if we can come up with a shortlist of companies to approach
(Workday, for example, or Blackrock for another) can you help me make a
pitch deck and audio reel for the Future of Work idea? I think if we can
time some outreach to the podcast release we can get some attention!

In the meantime, I'm pushing W50 based on your feedback. Fingers' crossed!

All best,
Josh

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rou=
ghly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corporate podcast like Ac=
centure. This includes all development (creative), research, writing, fact-=
checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production and exc=
lusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the level we do.<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work process, it varies. However, I think=
 what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work together to build and e=
xecute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the World 50 audience. =
World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be given opportunities=
 to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-t=
o-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, including: development =
(creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping,=
 production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T=
his is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our production servic=
es work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers =
really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different vendors (Dis=
tributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put together a mark=
eting plan as well. However, we can strategize together on this and help ge=
t this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive, so it requir=
es another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it sounds like=
 this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s only distributed to members=
 of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It&#39;d be a pri=
vate link essentially. So, long story short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven co=
mpany, we are a service oriented company. Might be good to include some cli=
ents we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua=
 Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, In=
vesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really glad=
 we spoke the other day - I think I have a really good lead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I=
 spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chief of Fortune=
 who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re that group I&#39;ve be=
en on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely exp=
anded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re structured into int=
erest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pit=
ched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each group to cr=
eate a series of insights to share across all the groups and he loved it. H=
e was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50 had been ta=
lking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had considered =
(which was focused on interviewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are=
 issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructuring, and ar=
en&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to media is going forward.=
 Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, and there is no gua=
rantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to =
build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally.=
 I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said that wo=
uld be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of =
ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 =
years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you=
 think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing (based off the Accent=
ure podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # references for G=
ilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

t;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest conc=
ern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that would be required to=
 interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with the represent=
atives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I =
would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all this so you can ke=
ep it in mind for pricing!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =E1=
