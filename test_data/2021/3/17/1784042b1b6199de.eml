Mike,

I was comparing notes with some other W50 folks about the podcast idea, and
the prevailing suggestion is that it'll be an easier pitch if it was run as
a test. Do you think that attaching some metrics for success - such as a
certain # of spontaneous emails from each group, or a total download rate,
or similar over the first season would be useful framing?

Separately, I'm due to reconnect with Eric Lent. Do you have any feedback
on how to bring this up so it's congruent with your plans for the groups as
a whole?

Much obliged!
Josh
