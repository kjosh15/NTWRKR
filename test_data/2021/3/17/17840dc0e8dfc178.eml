Damian,

Excellent talking to you earlier today. A few action items to follow up on:

- A call w/ your consultancy service makes a ton of sense and seems like a
natural place to explore collaboration. Can you connect me?

- A separate call to do a walkthrough of our sandbox, so your peers can get
a better idea of what the platform provides as a service (dashboards, data,
etc.), seems like a good next move. Who do you think is right?

Separately, I've included a brief overview deck. There's also the video on
our site <http://www.indigometrics.com> - but honestly, walking through the
product itself is likely highest value.

I really appreciated the insight you offered around recognizing the values
of products. I'm looking forward to seeing how we could connect the dots to
what you're building!

All best,
Josh
