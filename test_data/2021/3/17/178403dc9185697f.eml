Chris,

Been thinking about how to establish a solid corporate culture as we
onboard our first official hires. A few things seemed like immediate
options:

1. Send flowers and/or a bottle of wine for April 1 start dates
2. Ask for feedback on the onboarding process as we do it, so we can
establish the best process going forward + make it clear that the new hires
have agency
3. Establish a weekly all-hands mtg. Monday morning, and a biweekly social
hour on Friday
4. Set up Slack for everyone along with their email addresses
5. Schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else over the next few
weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's going.

I'm going to be reviewing BitLab's distributed workforce notes (they have
many) for other tips, but wanted to throw these out there as starting
points to improve an otherwise pretty ad-hoc onboarding!

Let me know what you think,
Josh
