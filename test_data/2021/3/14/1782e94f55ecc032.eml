Hi Josh,

After many discovery efforts I think I found a great solution to Othinn and/=
or Haakon doing art on line with me.  The program is called Scribble and is g=
reat!  If you are willing I can invite the drawers in your family to give it=
 a try. =20

Joel and I will be at home tomorrow, Sunday so if you=E2=80=99re available w=
hy don=E2=80=99t you call us, keeping in mind that we have daylight savings t=
ime tomorrow so we will be 1 hour ahead of usual.

As to the 2 e-cards for each boy,  I set up Haakon=E2=80=99s birthday card w=
ay ahead of time and forgot I had done so.  So, I sent him another card clos=
er to his birthday.  It was only fair to send 2 cards to Othinn.  It was ver=
y sweet of Othinn to thank us for the cards.

Love you,

Mom
