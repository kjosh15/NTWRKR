Cal, thanks for sharing the article about Facebook going all a lot in on VR
& AR. I tremble at the future of advertising we are likely to be confronted
with (ex. the scenes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D7bXJ_obaiYQ> in *Mi=
nority
Report*).

Glen, this reminds me of the scene from the film adaptation of *Ready
Player One* that made me laugh the loudest when I saw it: Halo Spartan
players running around the world <https://imgur.com/r/halo/IsmKS51> while
immersed in VR.

Flint, yes my Facebook feed has been particularly useless the past several
months, the content-I-care-about-to-unwanted-advertisements ratio has
nose-dived recently.

John V., I've seen several weak signals of the increasing awareness &
exploration of VR's potential for aiding mental health treatment but also
playing a role in real world physical treatments and pharmaceutical
therapies. Something to keep an eye on.

The Miko avatar phenom reminds me of some of the insights about what an
artificial personality could get away with--vice a real person--that the
Max Headroom creation <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDaHCjfvPViA> explo=
red.
Mainstream society is still pretty much unaware of how identity and how it
is presented to the rest of the world will be reshaped by the proliferation
of high-quality avatars for artificial or invented personalities.

Adding my own tidbit to this glimpse into the future, I was more than a
little surprised to see this video overview
<https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6774608822955724800/>
of the Minority Report-like AR gesture controls
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DPJqbivkm0Ms> that are available right no=
w.
Makes 2021 feel a bit more like the future we were promised.
