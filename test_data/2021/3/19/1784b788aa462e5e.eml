I'm free until 11am EST, so 10:30 would have the same 1/2 hr problem. Let's
keep the time and set another appt if need be, if that's ok?

In any case, I can tell you in advance that I'm looking for details on how
to work with your teams in a few ways:

1. directly with a large corporate client who is now interested,
2. in helping you produce a whitepaper examination of our data, and
3. in working with BOTH:
     i. a consortium of large multinationals on solving DE&I with data, and
     ii. an individual large multinational on an internal behaviors-led
DE&I initiative.

If you could help me get details on the terms needed for each of the above
to make sense to Wharton's People Analytics Group that would be
enormously helpful - and if you can send me anything in advance that would
be even moreso! So far I've talked to four large multinationals (including
two more since my call w/ Cade last Friday) and all of them have said
they're very interested... so things are moving quite quickly.

Very excited,
Josh
