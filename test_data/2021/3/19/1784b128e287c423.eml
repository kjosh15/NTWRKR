She should be good to go with just her vaccination record, BUT, even
without that she could get in with:


   - Copy of a valid residency permit of a relative that will be visited in
   Iceland.
   - Confirmation of the legal residency of a relative in Iceland (e.g.
   certificate from Registers Iceland).
   - Certified documents verifying familial ties to the family member (e.g.
   birth certificate, marriage certificate, proof of guardianship)


That last one doesn't make any sense for a sibling AFAIK; can you find
anything else? Otherwise, can you help me get the other three documents?

xoxo,
Josh
