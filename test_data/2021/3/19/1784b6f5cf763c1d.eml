Huge pleasure catching up - thanks so much for spending so long sitting in
the park; I learned a bunch. A few followups:

- Can you introduce me to Ziqq Rifit? I'm curious to learn about his
framework.
- You mentioned KnowInnovation and inclusiveinnovation.com; I'd love to
talk to someone from both about how to build an extraordinary (and better)
corporate structure
- Paul Jarvis: I've actually followed his stuff online several times, and
would LOVE to chat. Lots to talk about there.
- Finally, let me know how I can help you in turn. This would be the
biggest favor to me - I'd really like more opportunities to help get
thinkers and builders such as yourself moving faster in the world.

All best,
Josh

P.S. My company is www.indigometrics.com, FWIW!
