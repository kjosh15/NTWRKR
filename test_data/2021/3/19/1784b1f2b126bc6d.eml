    <p>Joshua,</p>
    <p>I printed the docs and your signature looks reproduced (it looks
      like the scan on your end was at a low resolution). If you&#39;d like=
,
      I can sign your name and add my initials and date. This is - for
      most documents - a legal means of signing. To be safe, send me an
      email authorizing me to sign for you in the matter of your
      organizing your LLC in Wyoming. I&#39;ll include this in the packet i=
f
      you&#39;d like.</p>
    <p>FWIW, your mother is leaving here ~9:00AM for a hearing
      appointment, so if you do this early your time, she can go by the
      P.O. while in town tomorrow.</p>
