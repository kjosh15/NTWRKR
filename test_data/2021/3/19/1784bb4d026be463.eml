&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corpo=

;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work tog=
ether to build and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the=
 World 50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be=
 given opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gild=
ed Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, inc=
luding: development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, =
equipment, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&g=

t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For o=
ur production services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#39;t=
 even track numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple di=
fferent vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients=
 put together a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize together=
 on this and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily compe=
titive, so it requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That =
said, it sounds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s only di=
stributed to members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simpl=
e! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So, long story short, we aren&#3=
9;t a data-driven company, we are a service oriented company. Might be good=
 to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times, JP =
Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Willi=
ams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <br>&=

ead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-=
in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re tha=
t group I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They =
recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re =
structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.=
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders fr=
om each group to create a series of insights to share across all the groups=
 and he loved it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing W=
orld 50 had been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what=
 he had considered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts).<br>=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big re=
structuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to medi=
a is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, =
and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that =
they&#39;ll try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think thi=
s is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to =
them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager an=
d Adam said that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking =
to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked clos=
ely with him for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing (b=
ased off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some=
 # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&g=

&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that w=
ould be required to interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate=
 with the representatives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. =
He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all=
 this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
