Hello, Elizabeth. I did a bit of research and what I found is that Sci-Grip 
does make a solvent cement formula that complies with SCQMD regulations. 
The formula is called "SciGrip 4SC" and this is the information I found on 
the Sci-Grip 
Site: https://www.scigripadhesives.com/scigrip-4sc-low-voc-acrylic-plastic-cement/

There is one big difference- the 4SC formula is one of Sci-Grip's "Water 
Thin" formulas; It is not a syrup like the #16 formula that we recommend. 
It's very thin.

For my personal acrylic projects I almost always use a "water thin" 
Sci-Grip cement. I like how the thin formula gets drawn into the parts via 
capillary action, and I like that the thin formulas set up much more 
quickly than the syrup formulas. The reason we recommend the syrup formula 
for the Crowbox is because the syrupy ones actually add a bit of material 
to the joints that are being cemented, which helps function as a gap 
filler. Handling the thick #16 cement is also more intuitive for users, 
since this cement can be applied directly from the tube.

You should have no trouble assembling your Crowbox with the 4SC formula but 
the application rules are different. You will absolutely need to use 
syringes OR a bottle with a syringe applicator tip. I would also recommend 
when you are working with the Crowbox parts that are 'pocket glued', that 
you inject less cement into the pockets than what I recommend in the 
assembly videos. In the videos I say to fill up the pockets, but that's a 
rule for #16 cement. Using a thinner formula like 4SC, I'd recommend you 
fill these pockets to half-way. 

I'd also recommend that when you are 'pocket gluing' parts that are 
temporarily held together with machine screws that you leave these screws 
*slightly* loose, inject the liquid cement into the pockets, then tighten 
the screws before you set the parts aside to dry. Leaving the screws 
slightly loose as you apply the cement will allow the cement to flow 
between the acrylic parts via capillary action, resulting in a more 
complete bond. Be sure to tighten the screws up after you apply cement. You 
don't have to be in a huge rush, but you should tighten the screws within 
2-3 minutes of applying the cement.

Also, here's a tip: When you get your can of cement and remove the cap, 
you'll find that the can's mouth has a thick metal seal. I like to take a 
nail and poke a tiny hole in the very center of this metal seal. This gives 
you a little opening so that you can insert your applicator needle and draw 
up cement. This cement evaporates extremely quickly, so it helps to only 
make a tiny hole in the seal to minimize exposure to the air. *Always* 
replace the cap immediately after you fill your syringe or applicator 
bottle! 

I found several videos on YouTube where various people demonstrate how to 
bond acrylic with water-thin solvent cement. Here is a pretty good one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4K8yo-_hSc

Let us know if you have more questions.

-Steve
