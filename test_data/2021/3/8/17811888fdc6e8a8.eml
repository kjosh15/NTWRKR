Thanks for this! I love the "CEO of your own interests" take especially.

Heard about the Mario Creator taking notes on kids playing in snow, dirt,
etc. anecdotally - maybe even from Clay Shirky? But no references, sorry.

I'll loop back in a few weeks to see if anyone on your side bit on our deck
- very much obliged!

All best,
Josh
