Andy,

Really glad we spoke the other day - I think I have a really good lead.

I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky
<https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/356564/fortune-editor-adam-=
lashinsky-steps-down-after-n.html>,
the former editor-in-chief of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World
50. They're that group I've been on retainer to as an "anti-McKinsey." They
recently hugely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They're
structured into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.

I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each group
to create a series of insights to share across all the groups and he loved
it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50 had
been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had
considered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts).

There are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big
restructuring, and aren't completely clear on what their approach to media
is going forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally,
and there is no guarantee they'll bite. There's also the risk that they'll
try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is
unlikely.)

That said, I think it's worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested
to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam said that would be super
helpful. More critically, I'm speaking to the new head of ALL the groups
tomorrow afternoon - I've worked closely with him for 5 years and would
love to put this idea to him then.

What do you think? If you're game, I need some rough pricing (based off the
Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # references
for Gilded.

Let me know what you think!

- J


P.S. Adam's biggest concern is the amount of "traffic cop" work that would
be required to interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with
the representatives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He
also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all
this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!
