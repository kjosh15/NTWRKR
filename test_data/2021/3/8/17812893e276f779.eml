Hey Josh,

*COSTS:*
Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corporate podcast like
Accenture. This includes all development (creative), research, writing,
fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-production
and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the level we do.

*PROCESS:*
In terms of a work process, it varies. However, I think what you can say is
something like:

Gilded and Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast
strategy that best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full
editorial approval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at
checkpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and
handles all production logistics, including: development (creative),
research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production,
post-production and exclusive music.

*#s*
This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our production
services work we don't distribute the shows, we don't even track numbers
really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different vendors
(Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put together a
marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize together on this and
help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive, so it
requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, it
sounds like this might be an internal podcast; if it's only distributed to
members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It'd be a
private link essentially. So, long story short, we aren't a data-driven
company, we are a service oriented company. Might be good to include some
clients we've worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua
Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer,
Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more.


*Dream Client List:*
On it.
