Hi! are you not getting my whats app messages? I had not heard a response
from you on the last two messages. When I am on the go, It's easier for me
to just send you a message there.
please check and let me know.
Wenna got the key and an ornament  I think you or Hulda wanted for her.
found the e-mail about the shipping label. it had expired. so you will need
to resent me one.
please let me know if you are getting my messages on Whats app.
These have been very busy weeks, taxes, court hearing and much more.
However, yes lets move things forward. I had asked to do a call if you like
. we can do that.
