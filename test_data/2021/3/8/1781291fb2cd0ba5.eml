Just heard back from Mahesh that he's forwarded the intro video and has
scheduled a meeting to talk to his head of D&I.

Also heard back from my contact at BP that he's asked his head of HR to
take a look and will revert back soonest.

Similarly, the CTO of Est=C3=A9e Lauder asked for a time for us both to get=
 on
the phone next week.

Good signs!
Josh
