Had a fun one today I wanted to share with you:

###

I thought a lot before my journey about what I wanted to ask, and settled
on "what do I need to pay attention to in order to be happier?" When the
drumming started I imagined myself walking into the front yard, where I had
started my other journey's from. Immediately my spirit animal nipped my
ankle from under the snow, summoning me. I leaped into the small hole it
had peeked out of and spiraled through a long narrow series of tunnels
after it, changing into its form as we went. Then, suddenly the tunnel
spiraled straight up and we popped back out... into the front yard. My
spirit animal ran around me in circles laughing at me, as it had answered
my question.

###

Plenty more on this particular journey - the cast of characters is widening
- but thought you'd get a laugh out of that bit. I hope you're doing well!!

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
