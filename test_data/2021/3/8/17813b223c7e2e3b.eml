Hi Josh,

I=E2=80=99m very impressed with the projects you sent me.  A couple of thing=
s struck me.

I think Indigometrics is a great idea.  I=E2=80=99m sure a lot of businesses=
 are stuck in a rut now and don=E2=80=99t know how to get out.  With your id=
ea there is easily produced weekly feedback between members of a business.  W=
hen I was working for Stoel Rives of course I got direction from my immediat=
e boss.  Information from higher up trickled down to secretaries and we coul=
d make some suggestions but it was my experience that that was not the norm.=
  Practices were set up by some in touch with reality and others didn=E2=80=99=
t understand what was needed to be done at our level. It looks like your pla=
n makes the communication easier and clearer. =20

I think it=E2=80=99s also a boon to have diversity in gender and ethnicity. =
 Who knows what wonderful ideas will come out of touching people who aren=E2=
=80=99t usually used in different practices. Also people working with those t=
hat they are unfamiliar with will hopefully pave the way for smoother relati=
onships and production.

As to Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing you should be proud of turning a ne=
gative into a positive.  It=E2=80=99s interesting and makes sense that when y=
ou looked at your data tension arose.  It sounds like you advocate new ways o=
f displaying data - sounds good. What a revelation that what you are working=
 on will benefit non diabetics as well as those with diabetics.

I=E2=80=99m involved, as a consumer, in two programs at this time.  One is C=
oursera that I=E2=80=99m taking a happiness class from.  It=E2=80=99s very o=
rganized in the way it presents data (lots of graphs) and the practical thin=
gs students might not have thought of.  I=E2=80=99m particularly interested i=
n how the brain is organized.  Apparently happiness is influenced by genetic=
s 50%, actions under our control 40% and life circumstances 10% of the brain=
.

The other program is one put out by AARP.  It is called Staying Sharp.  Ther=
e are tons of articles on how you can improve you mind and body.  Also lots o=
f games that test your reaction time, math, etc.  Glad I found this fountain=
 of improvement ideas.  I use it most every day.

Well dear Josh I talked your ear off enough for one day.

Hope Othinn enjoyed his birthday.

Love to you and the family,

Mom, Karen, Grandma
