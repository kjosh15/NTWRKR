Genius! # references are anything substantiating Gilded's work. So, total #
of listeners, total number of customers, speed of subscription rates... I
don't know what the metrics are in this industry, but anything you can
provide to make a clear case for why Gilded is the right company for the
job.

Thanks!!

P.S. I'd still like that list of dream clients from you; really curious who
I can get to!
