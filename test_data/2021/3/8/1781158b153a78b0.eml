So good to hear from you! How is life in the countryside, and how's the
family??

I did a couple other tv series (one on + in China and another on video
games, which I got to EP), and still have a couple pitches out. Not that I
expect anything to come of them, but it is fun to have a hand in!

Glad to hear you're well; it's a crazy world out there at the moment. Makes
me very glad we go to have all those adventures back in the day!

All the best,
Josh
