     1. Access door nut holder thing. I cut the acrylic wrench in two and g=
lued the 3mm nut inside to capture it permanently.

     2. My green acrylic had a slight warp, that I didn't notice until my b=
ox was assembled and during the testing of the coin platform it was binding=
. I noticed that if I applied slight pressure to the rails the coin platfor=
m would open without issue. I took a piece of scrap acrylic from the side o=
f the clear sheet and trimmed it to just wider than the opening between the=
 rails and the servo. I placed a piece of the styrene on top of the spreade=
r so servo wouldn't rub.&nbsp;

     <br>

    <div>
     <br>
    </div>
    <div>
     Lastly, I ported over the original CrOS to an Arduino ESP8266 NodeMCU.=
 I'll mention that this is centered around the home automation software, Ho=
me Assistant, but the crowbox OS can run independent of the Home Assistant.

    <div>
     <br>

     Currently the features are:
    </div>
    <div>
     <ol>
      <li>WIFI access, either as a client (connected to a wireless router) =
or ad-hoc (connecting directly from phone/computer to the crowbox)</li>
      <li>Ability to change programs remotely</li>
      <li>Platform sensor, see when someone/something is on the perch</li>
      <li>Coin sensor - see when and how many coins have been collected</li=
>
      <li>Reset coin count remotely</li>
      <li>Restart the crowbox</li>
      <li>Uptime - see how long your crowbox has been up (good if its on so=
lar power, or for troubleshooting)</li>
