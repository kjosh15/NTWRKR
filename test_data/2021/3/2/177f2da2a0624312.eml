short summary of my services:<br><br>&quot;Josh Klein has provided technolo=

A to Pfizer to BP, as well as to numerous very early stage startups in a va=

example, I can talk about my network in Asia + US + Europe, access to senio=

such as e-commerce, mobile, and cloud. As ever, I&#39;m trying to balance t=
