Thanks for the note Josh.

Please use the form at the bottom of our Submit page for potential 
investment consideration.

We don't want to waste your time so you should know that, at a high 
level, we invest in tech companies raising rounds of $500K and less at 
valuations of $3M and less that already have a live product with initial 
revenues. (Occasional exceptions to $1M and $6M, but _starting _at 
$25K/month in gross profit with strong growth to even consider at a $4M 
valuation).

It's probably worth carefully reviewing the detailed factors in the 
Automatic No and Pro Tips sections of that page.

*** Note specifically that we always require the product already be in 
the hands of users/customers and almost always require initial revenues.

Best,

Kevin
