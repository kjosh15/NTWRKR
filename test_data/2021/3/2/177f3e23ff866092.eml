Hey Stephen, wanted to hit you up on this one first. We're creating a small
consortium of 5-8 large companies using our culture analytics platform
<http://indigometrics.com> to solve for DE&I challenges with data. We're
working with Wharton's People Analytics team to bring in their lead DE&I
professor to help.

So far we are working with one of the largest US construction companies and
are in discussion with a similarly sized telecommunications company. I'd
like to get representatives from other industries and would love to use
this as an excuse to get to work together!

Let me know if you have a moment in the next couple weeks to discuss.

All best to you and yours,
Josh
