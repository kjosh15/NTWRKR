Hey David, wanted to hit you up on this one first. We're creating a small
consortium of 5-8 large companies using our culture analytics platform
<http://indigometrics.com> to solve for DE&I challenges with data. We're
working with Wharton's People Analytics team to bring in their lead DE&I
professor to help.

So far we are working with one of the largest US construction companies and
are in discussion with a similarly sized telecommunications company. I'd
like to get representatives from other industries and am particularly keen
to work with numerate executives such as yourself!

Let me know if you have a moment in the next couple weeks to discuss.

All best to you and yours,
Josh
