Sam,

Do you think Accenture would be interested in a Future of Work podcast? The
more I engage with their material the clearer it is to me that they could
do an entire series on this topic alone, and it fits really nicely with the
core of my research over the last five years. Let me know if it is worth a
followup call to talk about co-pitching the idea!

All best,
Josh
