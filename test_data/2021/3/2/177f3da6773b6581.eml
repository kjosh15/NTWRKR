Autonomy Is the Ultimate Success
--------------------------------

The beginning of my career probably sounds like a dream come true
to some. I was an attorney employed by powerful law firms,
working on important cases and transactions.

I flew on private jets with clients. Once, I flew alone on the
firm's jet just to file a brief at the Texas Supreme Court in
Austin and return. Okay, so the pilots were also there, but you
get the idea.

And yet, I couldn't stand it. Not only did I not enjoy practicing
law, I hated working for someone else. Years later, I realized
that second part was the real issue.

So I walked away, and figured out how to support myself without a
job. Early in the process, I was interviewed by an aspiring
author named Dan Pink for his first book, 2001's Free Agent
Nation (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmu7mwpvl4h6h07m3ef5/reh8h9uq7rmpvdu6/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNreDhoS00=3D
). At its essence, the book is about other people like me who
didn't enjoy answering to a boss, and how technology and
corporate dynamics were prompting us to go it alone.

Dan Pink went on to write bestseller after bestseller over the
subsequent 20 years. Fifteen years after he interviewed me, I
turned the tables on him as the very first guest on my podcast (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmu7mwpvl4h6h07m3ef5/8ghqh3ug3vo8pvbl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly91bmVtcGxveWFibGUuY29tL3BvZGNhc3QvZGFuLXBpbmsv
).

When reflecting back on Free Agent Nation, Dan had this to say
about the unifying motivations of the "free agents" he
interviewed:

And to my surprise, it turned out to be less of an economic story
and more of a psychology story. It was more about people yearning
for having a sense of autonomy and being true to themselves and
having some freedom and control over their lives.
What Dan is keying on here is intrinsic motivation, and he went
on to explore the topic in depth with his 2009 book Drive: The
Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmu7mwpvl4h6h07m3ef5/vqh3hmun47o639sw/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNreU52S0c=3D
). Pink boils down what motivates us to autonomy, mastery, and
purpose ... sound about right to me.

As I progressed deeper into my entrepreneurial journey, I'd
created what I thought was a "real" company, and ended up
restricting my own autonomy in the process. Not the deal I was
looking for, so I walked away from that as well in 2005.

Every time I did something "crazy" by leaving a seemingly
lucrative situation, I've gone on to exponentially greater levels
of financial success and gratification. I can't accept that this
is mere coincidence, given that when I have the proper motivation
in place, it's pretty hard to stop me. But you have to understand
that "more money" was never the motivator.

Maybe I'm an outlier when it comes to such a strict need for
autonomy. But it may be more accurate to say that I was just
early. After all, 60% of all small businesses are started by
people between the ages of 40 and 59 (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmu7mwpvl4h6h07m3ef5/l2heh6uo49lpv8tg/aH=

GwtYnVzaW5lc3MuaHRtbA=3D=3D
) -- and the most common reason given is "to be their own boss."

Making a lot of money is nice. And these days, a small digital
business can make loads of it. But the reasons to do it are your
sense of purpose, your creative mastery, and yes ... your
autonomy.

Anyway, I took this trip down memory lane thanks to Ryan
Holiday's essay on autonomy being the definition of success. In
it, he relates how "successful" people ranging from Marcus
Aurelius to Napoleon to Taylor Swift ended up with less freedom
and happiness than you would think, because of the trappings of
extrinsic forces.

Success is often viewed as achieving more and rising higher in
status. But the reality is that your success will be defined by
what you say no to, and what you refuse to put up with any
longer.

Empty Mind, Full Life
---------------------

Sure, it gets a little tougher to pick up new skills as we age,
just like doing a full squat is an adventure you're not quite
sure you'll return from. But harnessing a specific type of
mindset can help you learn effectively as an adult, and the
benefits of doing so are well worth it.

The Rite of Passage
-------------------

Transitions are how we get unstuck. Disruptions may be voluntary
(you leave a bad marriage or start a new business) or involuntary
(you get left or laid off), but the transition itself must be
voluntary. We have to choose to go through the process of turning
our fear and anxiety into renewal and growth.

Home Invasion

Home is where your head is at, and unwelcome guests can really
make a mess of things. If recurring thoughts continually bother
you, you are by no means alone. Here's how to handle them.

Get More Done With a Perspective Power Hour
-------------------------------------------

By Trudi Roth

A CEO client recently confessed to me, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m so busy on
back-to-back video calls that I don=E2=80=99t even have time for a
bathroom break.=E2=80=9D

That was no humblebrag. It was a clear, relatable illustration of
the dangers of over-accessibility, which research shows lead to
stress and burnout (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmu7mwpvl4h6h07m3ef5/n2hohqungpv4keu0/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9iZWF0LWJ1cm5vdXQv
).

While multitasking is a hallmark of our digital age, it=E2=80=99s nothing
new. Anyone with a busy job and personal life can lose sight of
the forest through the trees.

Luckily, there=E2=80=99s a simple technique you can use to overcome
overwhelm pioneered by the legendary diplomat, author, teacher,
and businessman George P. Schultz, who recently passed away at
100.

In the =E2=80=9980s, when he served as Reagan=E2=80=99s secretary of state,
Schultz would shut the door of his office, grab a pen and paper,
and declare himself unavailable for one hour. (Only the president
or his wife could interrupt.) In that small window, he made ample
room to think big.

Daydream Believer
-----------------

Schultz led a jam-packed life, notably holding four cabinet-level
positions under two presidents. Commanding respect from both
sides of the aisle, he tackled some of the greatest threats of
our times, from nuclear proliferation to climate change.

In 2017, New York Times journalist David Leonhardt shared
Schultz=E2=80=99s secret sauce. As he recounts:

Schultz told me that his hour of solitude was the only way he
could find time to think about the strategic aspects of his job.
Otherwise, he would be constantly pulled into moment-to-moment
tactical issues, never able to focus on larger questions of the
national interest. And the only way to do great work, in any
field, is to find time to consider the larger questions.
In other words, Schultz made space for purposeful daydreaming.

When your mind wanders, your mental default mode network (

) (DMN) is activated, tuning out the outside world and shifting
to an internal focus. This empowers you to innovate,
problem-solve, and make meaning out of your work and life.

How to Call the Schultz
-----------------------

A whole hour to daydream, free from online and offline
distractions, can feel exciting and daunting. Author Mike Sturm
suggests (

) a three-part approach:

* Start by journaling (

R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9qb3VybmFsaW5nLw=3D=3D
) to clear your mind. Simply jot down thoughts and feelings as
they arise.
* Next, consider your relationship with yourself and others. This
will bring up the three main areas that impact your life --
desires, expectations, and commitments -- and provide insight
into what=E2=80=99s in alignment and where conflicts exist.
* Finally, think about creative solutions to take action and move
things forward.

The key to it all is to remember to stay open and loose. A
Schultz hour makes you secretary of your inner state -- a
powerful vantage point to plot a bigger, brighter future.

This is how to carve out an hour a week to think big (

<p style=3D"color:#333">I flew on private jets with clients. Once, I flew a=

<p style=3D"color:#333">And yet, I couldn't stand it. Not only did I not en=

<p style=3D"color:#333">When reflecting back on <em>Free Agent Nation</em>,=

<blockquote style=3D"background:#fafafa;color:#666;font-style:italic;margin=

an economic story and more of a psychology story. It was more about people =
yearning for having a sense of autonomy and being true to themselves and ha=
ving some freedom and control over their lives.</blockquote>

<p style=3D"color:#333">As I progressed deeper into my entrepreneurial jour=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Every time I did something "crazy" by leaving a see=

 financial success and gratification. I can't accept that this is mere coin=
cidence, given that when I have the proper motivation in place, it's pretty=
 hard to stop me. But you have to understand that "more money" was never th=
e motivator.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Maybe I'm an outlier when it comes to such a strict=

all digital business can make loads of it. But the reasons to do it are you=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Anyway, I took this trip down memory lane thanks to=
 Ryan Holiday's essay on autonomy being the definition of success. In it, h=

se sight of the forest through the trees. </p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Luckily, there=E2=80=99s a simple technique you can=
 use to overcome overwhelm pioneered by the legendary diplomat, author, tea=
cher, and businessman George P. Schultz, who recently passed away at 100.</=
p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">In the =E2=80=9980s, when he served as Reagan=E2=80=
=99s secretary of state, Schultz would shut the door of his office, grab a =
pen and paper, and declare himself unavailable for one hour. (Only the pres=
ident or his wife could interrupt.) In that small window, he made ample roo=
m to think big. </p>
<h4 style=3D"font-family:calluna, Georgia, serif;color:#111;font-size:22px;=
margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:30px">Daydream Believer</h4>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Schultz led a jam-packed life, notably holding four=
 cabinet-level positions under two presidents. Commanding respect from both=
 sides of the aisle, he tackled some of the greatest threats of our times, =
from nuclear proliferation to climate change.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">In 2017, <em>New York Times</em> journalist David L=
eonhardt shared Schultz=E2=80=99s secret sauce. As he recounts:</p>
<blockquote style=3D"background:#fafafa;color:#666;font-style:italic;margin=
-left:0;padding:20px 30px">Schultz told me that his hour of solitude was th=
e only way he could find time to think about the strategic aspects of his j=
ob. Otherwise, he would be constantly pulled into moment-to-moment tactical=
 issues, never able to focus on larger questions of the national interest. =
And the only way to do great work, in any field, is to find time to conside=
r the larger questions.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"color:#333">In other words, Schultz made space for purposeful d=
aydreaming. </p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">When your mind wanders, your mental <a href=3D"http=

	<li>Finally, think about creative solutions to take action and move things=

</ul>
