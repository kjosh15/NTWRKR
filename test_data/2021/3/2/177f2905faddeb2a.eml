Villi,

Thanks for the call the other day; I'm still working hard not to look at
electric mountain bikes... In the meantime, how does this look for a short
summary of my services:

"Josh Klein has provided technology and innovation strategy and project
design for organizations from the CIA to Pfizer to BP, as well as to
numerous very early stage startups in a variety of verticals. His focus is
on new and emerging technologies, cross-border markets, and large to small
company integrations."

Happy to add more to this how/where you think it'll have the best impact;
for example, I can talk about my network in Asia + US + Europe, access to
senior leaders at most of the S&P, and role in ground-breaking technologies
such as e-commerce, mobile, and cloud. As ever, I'm trying to balance the
US propensity for outright bragging with the more stoic Icelandic approach
to self-presentation, so any advice is appreciated!

Finally, can you introduce me to your brother here in Akureyri? I'm
extremely keen to find some punching bags and a community!

Me=C3=B0 kve=C3=B0ja,
Josh
=E1=90=A7
