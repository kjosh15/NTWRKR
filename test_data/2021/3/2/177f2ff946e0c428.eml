Just got off the phone with her; she's great and ticks a lot of boxes -
basic excel numeracy, customer facing roles, very much into planning and
project management, and mission-driven. She def. wants a strong culture,
which I think is important for us at this stage, and is comfortable with a
fully remote team infrastructure.

My only concerns are around retention - she has moved around a lot in
search of adventure - and, concomitant to that, reliability. No evidence
that either would be a problem, but I wanted to flag them as
considerations.

Looking forward to talking this over Thurs,
Josh
