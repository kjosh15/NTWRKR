Joerg,

Wanted to loop back around - my company is growing quickly and I've got no
bandwidth to pursue these yet, but didn't want to leave you hanging. I'll
continue to keep an ear open, and please do ping me if there's anything
specific I can do to help you advance any of these!!!

all best,
Josh
