Cade, Caitlin,

Wanted to briefly follow up with a couple updates:


   - I spoke to Carl Haney (CTO at Estee Lauder) and he's very bullish.
   I'll be sending him a proposal one-pager this week but there are a few
   different ways we could propose Wharton integrating.

   - So far we've had three (of the three I asked) large multinationals
   express interest in a D&I consortium and I have a shortlist of ten more
   I'll be reaching out to this week. I have a call w/ Laura on Thursday to
   get more details.

   - My cofounder and I spoke and he agrees there's an endless rabbit hole
   of data we could provide for analysis. I'd love to get your team in touc=
h
   with him to start the conversation if you have time on your calendar in =
the
   next few weeks!

Otherwise still interested in feedback on the items mentioned in my last
email - really excited to see where we can go!

All best,
Josh

<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thanks for this!! And thanks again for the call on F=
riday; I&#39;m super excited to see what we can do together!<br>
<br>
I wanted to dig into the three main ways I had noted down for us to potenti=
ally work together. Some of this may be redundant, but given the potential =
for long-term partnership I&#39;m keen to make sure there aren&#39;t any su=
rprises. Please correct me anywhere herein!<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Research collaboration. We&#39;re looking at our existing data sets to f=
igure out what we could support, but need a little more clarity on the outp=
uts.<br>
<br>
We&#39;d like to see a deliverable that helps companies understand how Indi=
gometrics is effective and accurate in measuring (and potentially in changi=
ng) internal behaviors and values. How does that align with the kind of res=
earch you&#39;re doing internally? Could
 you tell me more about what the resulting white paper could/would include =
(i.e., scope/depth and potential areas of focus&#39;), where it might be pu=
blished, and how you would be comfortable with us using it?
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Existing company integration. We love the idea of integrating your coach=
ability research into an existing customer, and have a couple in mind. Howe=
ver, we would have to cover our costs by passing them on to the client. Is =
this in line with your expectations,
 are there any limitations on the use of your findings, and/or do you have =
any costs that need to be considered?<br>
<br>
<br>
3. New company integration. Our largest customers at the moment happen to b=
e through a 3rd party provider in the UK who would not be amenable to Whart=
on&#39;s participation. Do you have any companies you already have a good r=
elationship with (such as Estee Lauder!)
 that we could approach? I&#39;ve got a pretty good network so don&#39;t ne=
ed intros specifically, but would love to know where to look for overlap! T=
his feels like the best possible instance for collaboration as it&#39;s cle=
an slate with loads of potential upside for
 both parties.<br>
<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll be speaking to Carl Haney of Estee tomorrow, and am looking to hea=
r back from Laura at the end of next week to see if you have any DE&amp;I f=
aculty who might be interested in a collaboration.<br>
<br>
Finally, thanks again for bearing with me while I ask all the dumb question=
s - I&#39;m trying to get them all in up front!<br>
