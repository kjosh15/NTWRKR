So I worded that poorly I think, we would still be using an S3 bucket to
store/provide access to the files, but rather than running a script inside
of the VM(s) we have set up right now, we run it serverless in the cloud.
The advantages of serverless are that we only pay for the amount of time
the function needs to run each time it's called (AWS quotes about $0.20 per
1 million calls <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/>, it also provides
a free tier we might never even pass), and it is incredibly reliable as AWS
handles provisioning machines to run the code when needed so it would take
nearly the whole data center going down to stop the process running.
To the end-user, they shouldn't notice a difference as the end result is
the same as both options are just processing the API response and putting
it into the bucket as a CSV. So it's more a debate of how we run the
background job environment wise.
Using this basically means, we tell AWS to do something and it's on them to
do it, we don't have to worry about our VM crashing at 3am and
causing issues, as there is no VM for us to manage, its all handled for us.

It boils down to, other than paying for the S3 bucket, it would be pretty
much free to run it in the VM as we are already paying for that computing
space, but running it serverless would mean a small added cost for its
increased reliability and ease of expanding either the code or the number
of clients using it later.
