Oh my apologies, I was holding off on a timeline until I'd had a look at
the AWS set-up to figure out exactly how I was going to integrate to best!
Sorry about that, it's only been about an hour and if the API works around
how I think it works will only take about < 30mins to get it running.

So I have the script set up, and there are two ways it can be run. The most
maintainable would be running it in a serverless container (AWS Lambda) and
we can set up AWS to automatically run the function at set a set time of
day. In that case, getting it set up is clicking a few buttons and
defining some environment variables so if we ended up adding this for other
clients would take very little time to get up and running.
The other way would be the original ask, where I can set up a CRON job on
the VM to just run the python script at set times, the simple
difference between the two is Lambda just scales a lot better.

Let me know what you think!
