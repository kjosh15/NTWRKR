I'm working to get a pitch deck for a Future of Work podcast to you for 
floating by your Microsoft agent, but in the meantime wanted your advice on 
how to capitalize on the Accenture podcast.

It's due out April 15; I'm planning to put up a LinkedIn post with a quote 
and how it connects to either my consulting work or Indigometrics for each 
episode. Do you have any advice on how to do that well, and/or what else to 
do with it? I'm not active on any other social media. :/

Very, very much appreciated - you're going to have to come by Iceland 
sometime so I can thank you properly!!

All best wishes,
Josh
