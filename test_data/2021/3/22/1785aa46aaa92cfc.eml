Our biggest client is working on a HBR case study to publish in a couple
months and Wharton wants to do a whitepaper. The investment community is
supposed to reach a fever pitch over the next 6-12 months. Do you have time
for a brief call in the next couple weeks to talk about how to bootstrap a
PR blitz off this in order to solicit investment/M&A?
