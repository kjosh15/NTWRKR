Jaron,

Look for a revised pitch on the TV show shortly. In the meantime, I had two
quick items of potential interest:

1. I'm the cofounder of a SaaS platform <https://www.indigometrics.com>
that uses short (three minute) quantitative peer-to-peer surveys to model
human behavior and surface longitudinal behavior insights. Do you know of
any data ethicists that might be interested in discussing how to improve it=
?

2. I'm building a podcast on the Future of Work and know Microsoft is doing
a lot of work in the area. Do you know who could tell me if a collaboration
is possible?

Really appreciate your consideration - let me know if this is off the mark
and I'll keep it out of your inbox in future.

All best,
Josh
