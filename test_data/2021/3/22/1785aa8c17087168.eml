NP!

Some quick questions:

1. What are the maintenance costs for the serverless container vs a S3
bucket?
2. Am I right that functionally these solutions are identical for the end
user (I.e., they securely connect to a file repository of some kind and
pull out the files there)?
3. Are you suggesting the Lamda is more maintainable than the S3 bucket b/c
it uses AWS native controls instead of a VM's cron controls?
