Joshykins!

Great to hear from you and see that you're doing well with fingers in lots
of pies.  Do you still present I wonder?  I stepped out of TV a while back,
family life and moving to the depths of the countryside meant another
career for me in marketing for an online estate agent.  I met up with some
of the folk from The Link a couple of years back which was great.  Part of
me misses the crazy world of TV.

Hope you're well and take care,
Lizzie
