Hey Josh,

Apologies for the slow response. We are incredibly busy right now, and my
personal life has been quite busy as well.

This is all very awesome, I really appreciate your excitement around this
project.

If you think we can make a strong presentation to Microsoft, let's discuss
this angle further. From your short list, Workday and Mastercard jump out
to me as well.

Know you're on break right now, but let's plan on chatting when you're back=
.

gt;&gt; Hey Josh,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $3=
0-40k per episode for a corporate podcast like Accenture. This includes all=
 development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipme=
nt, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music. Everything i=

gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROCESS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In ter=
ms of a work process, it varies. However, I think what you can say is somet=
hing like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =
Gilded and Josh will work together to build and execute a creative podcast =
strategy that best serves the World 50 audience. World 50 will have full ed=
itorial approval, and will be given opportunities to provide feedback at ch=
eckpoints along the way. Gilded Audio is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles =
all production logistics, including: development (creative), research, writ=
ing, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-producti=
on and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was =
getting at in our call: For our production services work we don&#39;t distr=
ibute the shows, we don&#39;t even track numbers really (our clients do, th=
ough). We rely on a couple different vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for th=
at, and typically the clients put together a marketing plan as well. Howeve=
r, we can strategize together on this and help get this thing heard. Podcas=
ting is extraordinarily competitive, so it requires another budget for dist=
ribution and marketing. That said, it sounds like this might be an internal=
 podcast; if it&#39;s only distributed to members of World 50. In that case=
, distribution is super simple! It&#39;d be a private link essentially. So,=
 long story short, we aren&#39;t a data-driven company, we are a service or=
iented company. Might be good to include some clients we&#39;ve worked with=
 instead: New York Times, JP Morgan Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington=
 Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Amy Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Clevelan=

ot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recently hugely expanded in size through a buy=
out of the G100. They&#39;re structured into interest/role groups - i.e., C=
MO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<b=
r>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a po=
dcast interviewing leaders from each group to create a series of insights t=
o share across all the groups and he loved it. He was very clear that it wa=
s exactly the kind of thing World 50 had been talking about doing, but was =
much more practical than what he had considered (which was focused on inter=
viewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are issues - World 50 is just =
on the other side of a big restructuring, and aren&#39;t completely clear o=
n what their approach to media is going forward. Adam asked for some time t=
o socialize this internally, and there is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. Th=
ere&#39;s also the risk that they&#39;ll try to build it using internal res=
ources. (Although I think this is unlikely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I thin=
k it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I=
 pull together a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More =
critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow aft=
ernoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put=
 this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game,=
 I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a wor=
k process breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me =
know what you think!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - J<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;=
traffic cop&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group,=
 decide on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each =
group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an E=
P as well as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<=
