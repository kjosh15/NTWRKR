My take is that this doc makes clear that engagement software is about
feelings whereas Indigometrics is about behavior. If we miss that point the
rest doesn't make sense, and if we land it the rest can fall where it may -
it's still different than engagement. You ok if I send this out as is, or
would you rather be more circumspect and remove the cyclical feedback
element?
