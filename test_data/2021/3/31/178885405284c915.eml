The dynamic feedback cycle comes from Steve Revnew, who said "What comes to
mind off the top of my head is leading with how this is much different than
an engagement survey and the golden nuggets you will gain through this vs
an engagement survey. My take on your service is that it is not a one-time
survey but a dynamic tool that employees will continue to build and add
their feedback."

So, pretty heavily leaning into the ongoing survey element. Unless that's a
deal-breaker for you can I send this out as-is?
