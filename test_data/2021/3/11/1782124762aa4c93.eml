Today and tomorrow are booked up solid EST, I'm afraid, and this weekend is
the boy's bday parties. How does 9am EST the 17th look for you?
Unfortunately (or fortunately, really!) my business is starting discussions
with possible investors, and given that investors =3D=3D income for me and =
my
family it's consumed almost my entire calendar in the near future...!

In the meantime, let me know what date you'd like to drop off the books and
I'll reorder the shipping label, and let me know how the list of things to
buy/sell is coming along.

All best wishes,
Josh
