Not sure what you're up to atm, but just heard (before official
announcement) that Kria is looking to hire a general operations manager. I
bet you know someone who would be better for this than they would (like,
say, a woman?) so figured I'd float it by you.

Otherwise hope you're all doing well!!! We may be coming by R.vik over the
break, so perhaps we'll get a chance to say hi IRL!

All best,
Josh
