Huzzah!! +1 on you not needing more tracks/credibility/business skills. I
would (gently!) ask if you are concerned that you are "not enough" to
manage a fund, in which case I'm first in line to tell you otherwise.

Right now I'm super focused on building a consortium of companies to solve
for DE&I using data. This is private, but so far Bechtel is in, Motorola
and Sherwin Williams are in discussion, and I've got meetings scheduled
with the CTOs of Estee Lauder and BP. Happy to send you the pitch, but
would love your thoughts at the outset - my goal is to charge each company
$250k in lieu of doing an angel or seed round.

Along those same lines, would AKQA like to use Indigometrics as part of
their internal culture initiative? If you're going to be involved I'm happy
to do a revenue share and/or big price reduction just to have an excuse for
you to kick the tires!!

Super stoked to hear about all the progress. As ever, please let me know
how I can be of any help!!
- J
