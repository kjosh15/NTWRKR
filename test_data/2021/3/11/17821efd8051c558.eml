Hey, do you have time in the next couple weeks to reconnect? We're (still)
growing and getting even more traction around the DE&I topic, and I wanted
to ask your advice on creating an outside board to improve our
representation (esp. in terms of diversity). This will come as a shock, but
hiring for diversity as a startup is a challenge!!

I hope you're doing well - what's news on the book and the Future of the US
projects?

- J
