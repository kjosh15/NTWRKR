TSK



Tongue Synchronised Kinetics

Edward Ligocki

May 2001 =96 March 11th, 2021

C/O Josh Klein



Hi Josh,



I was going to send you a full cycle of what has transpired since last comm=
unicating, but it would be have been a long letter of =93and then I, and th=
en I, and then I=94. This letter with a better nutshell of the concept shou=
ld be better,, a bit long, so best read from anything other than your smart=
phone. In regards to you consulting in the Calgary area, that will be in an=
other letter that I=92ll send a later today.



*



TSK is a hands free, wearable controller/mouse, tap & swipe system to assis=
t in the movement of a cursor/click on a PC, and/or swipe/tap on a smartpho=
ne, tablet, device and/or refined maneuvering of an electric wheelchair; as=
 per use of a slim dental insert with commands made by tongue swipes and ts=
k=92ing and tapping upon it in the area of our front teeth and pallet just =
above the front teeth.



TSK, is an acronym for Tongue Synchronised Kinetics and was conceived after=
 street level research of physically challenged people relegated to use of =
systems that weren=92t evolving in a generational manner along with current=
 emerging regular technology.



Essentially, TSK is a controller for those wanting to access and manipulate=
 current technology with greater ease, proficiency and privacy. Considering=
 how our smartphones have almost eclipsed use of our PC=92s, such common th=
ings such as texting and selfies, photography and videos, music composition=
 and downloading, etc would now be equally afforded to those with motor/mus=
cle challenges.



Sitting on your hands and thinking about operating all your devices helps w=
ith visualising TSK.



From the time of original conception to the present, technologies have emer=
ged that not only attain the original intent of TSK for those with limited =
motor skills, quadriplegics, amputees and various other palsies and strokes=
, but also apply to regular markets where a third extra controlled assistan=
ce would be helpful within aerospace, gaming, robotics and other industries=
. The latter application to regular markets has a working title of =93Lucy=
=94. The following will be broken up into TSK and Lucy.



TSK



Without too much background on looking for the technology in 2001 to attain=
 a cursor/tap system, there was a technology licensed from the Canadian Spa=
ce Agency that was used on the Canada Arm on the Space Shuttle. That produc=
t was a minute pressure sensitive textile called Kinotex, however the drawb=
ack was its texture. So as an area/pad the tongue would move about would be=
 akin to licking canvas, causing tongue fatigue and cankers; the pad, or fi=
lm needed to be smooth. Later in 2004, after an evaluation by James Levine =
at IBM/Watson Labs, we determined that the next closest film/pad had anothe=
r drawback, moisture or saliva disrupting the pad in sensing where the tip =
of the tongue were laying. Currently there are several smartphones utilisin=
g tech that not only work, or understand where the user wants to swipe & ta=
p, but also in extreme water/rain/muddy conditions including grit and lumpy=
 gloves, which negates offset tongue at rest, saliva and left over bits of =
food travelling about the mouth.



The next problem was the tsk=92ing or tapping and the added problem with sw=
allowing. Tsk=92ing is done primarily with an open mouth and is actually ea=
sier than tapping ones tongue, saying/tonguing =93tadah=94 also works quite=
 well. Once the cursor is at the area one wants it to be, a tsk or tada-tap=
 is needed just like a left/right click. For TSK, the pad - to sense the co=
mmand of tsk=92ing and tapping - it is actually the reverse of how we use o=
ur smartphones; the command for TSK is on the release from the pad, so tapp=
ing might be better understood as gapping. A tsk or a tadah would be three =
movements; tongue as cursor on pad, gap during tsk=92ing, tongue returning =
to pad. Teeth tapping can be introduced too, for things like hitting the sp=
ace bar when writing a Word document, or placing copy/cut text.



Swiping on smartphones requires gapping/sensing for scroll flinging already=
, so pending what is in use, PC, smartphone, etc the TSK would know which p=
latform it=92s commanding. For the user the choice of device wanting to be =
used happens from a drop menu, and can be worked in tandem with Google Glas=
s, directly on the PC, TV or smartphone.



Swallowing; when one swallows, the mouth closes and there is a pressure dro=
p as well as the tongue compressing upon the area where TSK is situated and=
 some teeth clenching. This can be resolved in a number of fashion. For tho=
se with greater control of pointing their tongue, the area of the pad under=
stands that it is in cursor mode or swallowing mode due to it feeling a sma=
ller portion or a whole tongue compression upon the pad, parameters sensing=
 the tongue over the breadth of the mouth as opposed tongue focus towards o=
nes front teeth. The other solution is a micro diaphragm that detects the p=
ressure change within the mouth and teeth clenching during swallowing, givi=
ng pause to TSK in those moments and not create some cursor nightmare on th=
e users device.



When Google Glass came about, I recognised that TSK could provide the user =
with tidier and more private use of their online activity and assist in the=
 drop menu for whichever platform they chose to use. I then started thinkin=
g about different QWERTY layouts and common letter couplings to help with t=
yping, to stave off tongue fatigue and clustered information the user tsk=
=92ed at. Or better put, how much area one needs to move their tongue about=
, and in what is the field of vision on the device; if you think about the =
finger mouse-sensor pad that we use on our PC, the area we finger/move abou=
t is actually not much bigger in area than our 4 front teeth and upper pall=
et.



A future generation of TSK, would incorporate speech command. For most of t=
he world, speech (regardless of impediments) allows for projection. We can =
speak loud or quietly or whisper, control vocalizations. For others, speech=
 therapists and human translators are required as some can neither control =
volume from whisper to loud, and also talk with more guttural back of the m=
outh soundings for their words. Stephen Hawkings human translator understoo=
d very minor grunts, gargling, quiet uhchts and tongue clucks when Hawkings=
 wasn=92t using his computer to voice.



Because TSK is in the mouth, it would provide for a projected augmented voi=
ce to those where a common speech adaptive voice program lacks. No differen=
t than how our adaptive systems work in learning our voice; an in the mouth=
 system could learn the soundings of extreme impediment of which that perso=
n is the only one who speaks their language. Currently, a human translator =
must learn and be with a person who wishes to vocalise which reduces indepe=
ndence and privacy of conversation. In other words, a hyper-version of Goog=
le translate, that can augment a voice on their smartphone in almost real-t=
ime.





Lucy



Lucy is the working name for TSK used in adjacent industry and technology n=
ot strict to those with physical challenges. Louis Leakey thought he had di=
scovered the missing link between primates and humans and named the skeleta=
l remains =93Lucy=94.



Gaming



When I started delving into the world of gamers, virtual reality headsets s=
uch as Occulus and controllers/joysticks etc, it struck me that; all comman=
ds including moving forward commenced at the hands and it was doubtful that=
 orbital treadmills would pick up anytime soon to reflect running within a =
virtual game-scape. This also goes for gaming on regular screens.



Lucy would allow for running forward and steering oneself in the game; tong=
ue touch at bottom of front teeth with left to right swipes, for example. O=
r TSK=92ing for a jump, left right pale taps or teeth clacks for somersault=
ing left or right, or just used to reload the weapon or grab some hidden ma=
gical Easter egg while slaying a dragon. A gamer could customise how their =
third hand could work within their game field. Future games could be develo=
ped for challenged persons to get on the game field and not just watch thei=
r friends play.



Fitness/Health & Wellness



With the current fitness craze and wearables, Lucy fits nicely into this cr=
owd wanting to enhance and better understand their performance in whatever =
regard of exercise regimen they partake. This is more a component set that =
FLIR own but likely in other forms within Google.



With Lucy in the mouth no different than a mouthguard but slimmer, Lucy cou=
ld detect oxygen intake, environmental pollution for the jogger, cycling or=
 outdoor yoga Tai Chi crowd; heart rate, hydration needs, breathing lapses,=
 bodily temperature changes, and other saliva data not picked up via a smar=
twatch or arm sticker. Users could then determine whether or not it was wis=
e to go jogging through the Washington underpass, at rush hour, in the heig=
ht of Summer, or cycle the length of 5th avenue while road crews are re-asp=
halting.



Theoretically, considering Covid-19 or any virus or flu, and our want to be=
tter understand aerosolisation in the work place, gym, public space, etc an=
d the current technology to detect specific molecules and clusters; a futur=
e Lucy could be developed to help medical sciences understand where people =
are likely picking up viruses. FLIR would be key in developing this Big Dat=
a application and Cloud for peers to review worldwide. Similar to satellite=
s tracking dust storms or other atmospheric changes and phenomena, if adapt=
ed within the =93Lucy for Fitness=94, viral spread could at some point be v=
iewed no different than we look at Google maps. True viral tracking, and an=
onymous. I do know that leaps have been made in the field of =93smelling=94=
 and molecular distinction; Lucy would likely bring in other aerosol type d=
ata that science may or may not be looking at,, e.g., those with Lucy at se=
a-level have lower instances of virus than those traipsing about in Death V=
alley or atop skyscrapers in Denver. Lateral and vertical tracing, who know=
s?





Aerospace/Avionics/Military & Up-screen Tech



I=92ll start with an actual dilemma I encountered on two worksites. Both pl=
aces required looking at my work phone for design features and wiring where=
 I could neither expand the picture nor move/scroll it about as I had to us=
e both hands for the job. I was also in a workspaces lacking much room for =
any movement at all. Had I had Lucy, I could have moved the picture about t=
o where my hands were and had to do the work. In Avionics, Boeing use up-sc=
reen wiring layouts that can be augmented to overlay the actual wiring bein=
g worked on. Pending where the technician is working (maybe it=92s been upg=
raded), Lucy could allow for a 3-d skew to mimic the perception and allow f=
or the technician to not have to manually key a movement or bring up a conc=
urrent diagram as their head moves. Hands free commands when hands are need=
ed elsewhere.



In military applications, boots on the ground type settings, night vision o=
r regular binoculars could be attached to the helmet and zoomed in/out, ref=
ined infrared focusing or focusing, snapping a picture could be done withou=
t the Sergeant having to take his hands away from his firearm. I haven=92t =
delved to deep into military applications and there are likely many beyond =
what I can imagine. I do have a friend who is a senior all-tech director at=
 General Atomics who could give us a starting point and possibly the right =
people to talk to regarding solutions where a third hand would be of great =
use.



Robotics/Prosthetics



When I first thought about TSK, I always wanted to work it into an affordab=
le robotic prosthetic. When Google Glass emerged, I then had a better idea =
how to work a simple function limb with TSK; up-screen menu with crosshairs=
 on the Google Glass to pinpoint a command, e.g., reach for glass I=92m loo=
king at, spoon the soup to my mouth. It would be doable, and despite the in=
credible leaps in neural/implant robotics or locating/prosthetics being wor=
ked on at MIT, this tech is still many years away from affordability. One o=
f the most common complaints for those with non-functioning arms/hands, is =
not being able to feed oneself or raise a glass or scratch an itch.



Josh, I=92ll leave it at this for now, other than; TSK requires a compilati=
on of components largely at Google and it=92s likely that Google shares lic=
ensing with FLIR and other companies of other necessary component/s for adv=
anced models. This would include a receiver/box for the menu application fo=
r TSK to talk to when the user decides to create a Word document on their P=
C, or send an emoji on their smartphone, and so forth,, there seem to be pl=
enty of objects that talk and remotely commanded via smartphones on the mar=
ket. The receiver can be used with Lucy too but once again, there are a num=
ber of current technologies linking devices via apps and such.



The key individuals at Google that are key to those components and developm=
ent are;



~ Karen Roter Davis; who oversees all such new device Google technology at =
their X facility, and also part of the start-up team at Google. Going direc=
tly to Google seems more prudent from a funding standpoint, no matter who I=
=92ve researched to develop, co-develop or putting together a team to proto=
type would still need to roll back to Google and likely Ms. Davis. In other=
 words, development would happen twice in the scheme of things, as develope=
rs here are middlemen/women in a greater regard and would, if anything sub =
the work out to Google or a Google partner. My Canadianess has that frugal =
Occams Razor approach to everything, if you have ANY thoughts on this, I=92=
m completely open.



Orpyx declined to discuss anything and are only focusing on their insoles f=
or sports and diabetes. A venture/accelerator group here that I speak with =
researched Orpyx and determined that my concept is quite elevated in techni=
cality than what their product line is. Orpyx also outsource development an=
d being relatively new, are structured as a company with many investors; mo=
re investment would create a diluted situation for them to manage. Further =
research of what I want to do is really something that has to happen states=
ide. Even Blackberry is outsourcing much of its development/design and rese=
arch. I love Canada, but I=92ve been down the road of trying to get things =
going here, and things have always worked its way south of the border. Ther=
e are numerous articles on Canada=92s lack of embracing its talent and R&D =
sector and then coupled with pretty hefty taxes has our crowd leaving.



~ Johnny Lee; honestly he=92s that team member type I had sought for so lon=
g and never found. I think he was part of Google/ATAP (Advanced Technology =
and Products), I had reached out to WellcomeLeap in hopes that Regina Dugga=
n, ATAP=92s former director could have aligned me with Mr. Lee, but I=92ve =
yet to get a reply. He could likely put all the parts together in a week. A=
 tinkerers mind with a farmer=92s formulation.



~ Clay Bavor; similar to the fellow above. I think Sony or someone is tackl=
ing the VR part of movement and controllers at a really hefty cost, and if =
anyone could see the application of Lucy, not as an end-all controller but =
an enhancement to the game-field, it would be Mr. Bavor.



Karen Roter Davis would be the key in Google, as she works with all departm=
ents. Interestingly enough, Sergey Brin a co-founder of Google has a family=
 foundation addressing Parkinson=92s,, one of those connected dot things th=
at happen when we want to connect dots,, neither here nor there.



Google is a behemoth and doesn=92t have a switchboard for cold calls and ex=
ploration, especially problematic as an outsider of sorts. Even finding Goo=
gle partners is a challenge, and I need to lean on you and your connections=
 to get TSK moving correctly. TSK is an extremely important device to me an=
d it=92s really only marketable via Lucy/Gaming. I have spoken to various g=
roups in the past who=92ve had the extreme difficulty on persuading investo=
rs as to the importance of tech for the challenged, including some fairly p=
rominent non-profit organizations. I=92m sure this has changed somewhat now=
, and grants are there, but initial grants don=92t really allow for growth =
but more grant applications.



Can we partner, or can you partner me with a peer company/people of yours? =
However you=92d like to structure royalties, equity, finders fees, director=
 to your benefit, I=92m open to. I do know that ideas on paper, intellectua=
l property and sweat equity isn=92t as valuable as many think (this path is=
n=92t new), but the concept/solution outweighs the financial gain, for me a=
t least. You had mentioned in a previous email that you could seek funding =
and/or people, I also have two avenues in Calgary that I=92ll be approachin=
g. Licensing something from paper alone is tough, a prototype is needed; I =
could be wrong of course, but physical objects typically rule the day in my=
 experience. Your thoughts on how to proceed are welcome and gladly rewarde=
d somewhere down the line, and seek funding for you for your work with me.



I=92m grateful beyond measure of your reply to my earlier nutshell of TSK, =
it was the tonic that kept my horse running. There=92s likely something=92s=
 I=92ve missed in here so any questions or prompts from you to help smooth =
things are very welcome.



Cheers

Ed



A brief close on tech ease/accessibility for all



The importance of it as to who it serve=92s, is really to bring more people=
 into how we build upon and are a part of the Internet of things. Without c=
oming off as too cynical; most of the world have it great for how new tech =
and gadgetry serves us, makes more time for us, helps us perform better and=
 better and better. However, for all the immense leaps in technology and as=
 we bound into a 5G tech-scape with everything imaginable created for us, i=
n our cars, homes and so forth, a large group of people have been left far =
behind. What is available to their various community of challenge is quite =
expensive, and still in many ways primitive 1G.



More people participating in the mix of the Internet brings perspectives an=
d innovation, and of equal importance (of which I think the concept would a=
ddress), provide career/employment opportunities, greater ease in participa=
ting almost at par within all levels of education and a caught up immersion=
 into technology the rest of us enjoy. One of the greatest challenges to th=
ose in various communities is keeping up; affordable, generational, emergin=
g tools still aren=92t really there yet.



There=92s a scene from the film The Aviator that plays as a great metaphor =
for Internet/technology accessibility; in the scene, Howard Hughes is havin=
g a full maid serviced dinner in a very affluent manor, during the great de=
pression, where the lady of the manor states,



=93=85 MONEY! I never cared for it!=94



to which Howard Hughes rebuts quite sternly



=93It=92s because you HAVE IT!=94



It=92s a great scene and plays well into our lives today and people wanting=
 to be less online, or connected, or wireless-less.



It - or Technology in this case - isn=92t a care for us because we have it;=
 it=92s great but not great but great again, it=92s right there and easily =
handled and tossed aside and browsed again, music, film, games, books, et a=
l. However, if one has not been afforded the ease of use of technology, com=
plete accessibility, our for-grantedness of the tool might come off as both=
 glib and quite selfish. While we bound off into a 5G world with everything=
 imaginable at our fingertips, in our homes and cars and everywhere, a larg=
e community is still far behind - with at best =96 primitive 1G technology.



I always think about kids relegated to being an audience to all those super=
 nifty games their friends are playing and not getting to participate; part=
icipation is community and community erases difference. My concept (towards=
 part of the challenged community) is an almost at par stepping stone for t=
hose kids on any current format the non-challenged are enjoying, and more i=
mportantly, move them out of special needs schooling and into a regular cla=
ssroom and able to keep up or excel, compete. As a side, I think about recr=
eating the gaming field in a way where any challenged person can participat=
e as unique avatars needed by regular avatars, including those visually imp=
aired. Though not a gamer myself, I am empathetic to those in the margin wa=
tching a world just out of reach.



When James/IBM and I spoke back in 2004, the majority of our conversation r=
evolved around making sure everybody had not only access and ease to techno=
logy, but an ease that maintained privacy/independence for individuals and =
allow them to manipulate and further create future tech, how they see it.



I discovered much later after James passed away that he was part of the fir=
st team in creating detection of gravitational waves, I think they got the =
Nobel prize or some mention. You would have never guessed this from chattin=
g with him; that was like sitting around a campfire, beers in hand with exc=
ited and funny banter,, you could hear him gesticulate. He said he created =
the soft-mouse system for those with Parkinson=92s from bits and pieces lyi=
ng around the lab, and then said quietly and coyly =93=85 I don=92t think t=
hey=92d mind=94.

 course Big Data and all such things. That concept is to assist paraplegics=

not woken at all. Very sobering. What was funny was, I was to have a teleco=

 technology with greater ease, proficiency and privacy. Considering how our=

 and videos, music composition and downloading, etc would now be equally af=
forded to those with motor/muscle challenges.

 time of original conception to the present, technologies have emerged that=
 not only attain the original intent of TSK for those with limited motor sk=
ills, quadriplegics, amputees and various
 other palsies and strokes, but also apply to regular markets where a third=
 extra controlled assistance would be helpful within aerospace, gaming, rob=
otics and other industries. The latter application to regular markets has a=
 working title of =93Lucy=94. The following
 will be broken up into TSK and Lucy.</span></p>

<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">Without =
too much background on looking for the technology in 2001 to attain a curso=
r/tap system, there was a technology licensed from the Canadian Space Agenc=
y that was used on the Canada Arm on
 the Space Shuttle. That product was a minute pressure sensitive textile ca=
lled Kinotex, however the drawback was its texture. So as an area/pad the t=
ongue would move about would be akin to licking canvas, causing tongue fati=
gue and cankers; the pad, or film
 needed to be smooth. Later in 2004, after an evaluation by James Levine at=
 IBM/Watson Labs, we determined that the next closest film/pad had another =
drawback, moisture or saliva disrupting the pad in sensing where the tip of=
 the tongue were laying. Currently
 there are several smartphones utilising tech that not only work, or unders=
tand where the user wants to swipe &amp; tap, but also in extreme water/rai=
n/muddy conditions including grit and lumpy gloves, which negates offset to=
ngue at rest, saliva and left over bits
 of food travelling about the mouth.</span></p>
<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</=
span></p>
<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">The next=
 problem was the tsk=92ing or tapping and the added problem with swallowing=
. Tsk=92ing is done primarily with an open mouth and is actually easier tha=
n tapping ones tongue, saying/tonguing =93tadah=94
 also works quite well. Once the cursor is at the area one wants it to be, =
a tsk or tada-tap is needed just like a left/right click. For TSK, the pad =
- to sense the command of tsk=92ing and tapping - it is actually the revers=
e of how we use our smartphones; the
 command for TSK is on the release from the pad, so tapping might be better=
 understood as gapping. A tsk or a tadah would be three movements; tongue a=
s cursor on pad, gap during tsk=92ing, tongue returning to pad. Teeth tappi=
ng can be introduced too, for things
 like hitting the space bar when writing a Word document, or placing copy/c=
ut text.</span></p>

<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">Swiping =
on smartphones requires gapping/sensing for scroll flinging already, so pen=
ding what is in use, PC, smartphone, etc the TSK would know which platform =
it=92s commanding. For the user the choice
 of device wanting to be used happens from a drop menu, and can be worked i=
n tandem with Google Glass, directly on the PC, TV or smartphone.</span></p=

<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">Swallowi=
ng; when one swallows, the mouth closes and there is a pressure drop as wel=
l as the tongue compressing upon the area where TSK is situated and some te=
eth clenching. This can be resolved
 in a number of fashion. For those with greater control of pointing their t=
ongue, the area of the pad understands that it is in cursor mode or swallow=
ing mode due to it
<i style=3D"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">feeling </i>a smaller portion or =
a whole tongue compression upon the pad, parameters sensing the tongue over=
 the breadth of the mouth as opposed tongue focus towards ones front teeth.=
 The other solution is a micro diaphragm
 that detects the pressure change within the mouth and teeth clenching duri=
ng swallowing, giving pause to TSK in those moments and not create some cur=
sor nightmare on the users device.

<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">When Goo=
gle Glass came about, I recognised that TSK could provide the user with tid=
ier and more private use of their online activity and assist in the drop me=
nu for whichever platform they chose
 to use. I then started thinking about different QWERTY layouts and common =
letter couplings to help with typing, to stave off tongue fatigue and clust=
ered information the user tsk=92ed at. Or better put, how much area one nee=
ds to move their tongue about, and
 in what is the field of vision on the device; if you think about the finge=
r mouse-sensor pad that we use on our PC, the area we finger/move about is =
actually not much bigger in area than our 4 front teeth and upper pallet.</=

<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">A future=
 generation of TSK, would incorporate speech command. For most of the world=
, speech (regardless of impediments) allows for projection. We can speak lo=
ud or quietly or whisper, control vocalizations.
 For others, speech therapists and human translators are required as some c=
an neither control volume from whisper to loud, and also talk with more gut=
tural back of the mouth soundings for their words. Stephen Hawkings human t=
ranslator understood very minor
 grunts, gargling, quiet uhchts and tongue clucks when Hawkings wasn=92t us=
ing his computer to voice.</span></p>

<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</=
span></p>
<font face=3D"Times New Roman"></font>
<p style=3D"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">Because =
TSK is in the mouth, it would provide for a projected augmented voice to th=
ose where a common speech adaptive voice program lacks. No different than h=
ow our adaptive systems work in learning
 our voice; an in the mouth system could learn the soundings of extreme imp=
ediment of which that person is the only one who speaks their language. Cur=
rently, a human translator must learn and be with a person who wishes to vo=
calise which reduces independence
 and privacy of conversation. In other words, a hyper-version of Google tra=
nslate, that can augment a voice on their smartphone in almost real-time.</=

 neither expand the picture nor move/scroll
 it about as I had to use both hands for the job. I was also in a workspace=
s lacking much room for any movement at all. Had I had Lucy, I could have m=
oved the picture about to where my hands were and had to do the work. In Av=
ionics, Boeing use up-screen wiring
 layouts that can be augmented to overlay the actual wiring being worked on=
. Pending where the technician is working (maybe it=92s been upgraded), Luc=
y could allow for a 3-d skew to mimic the perception and allow for the tech=

 a movement or bring up a concurrent diagram as their head moves. Hands fre=

&gt; Hi Josh,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The concept for para/quadriplegics; is essentially a smartphone screen=
 as a dental insert similar to what hockey/football players use to stop fro=
m gnashing their teeth, though much slimmer. How we swipe and move about wi=
th our thumb on a smartphone, this
 unit assists by tongue swipe, taps, tsk'ing.<br>
&gt; TSK is the concept name, Tongue Synchronised Kinetics.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Originally, it was devised on several complaints an sip &amp; puff in =
the motoring about in wheelchairs,, I then took it up a notch and worked it=
 into a mouse for a PC. The problems back then were saliva and heat on the =
sensory &quot;pad&quot;; a company was found that
 licensed the technology from the Canadian Space Agency that had a product =
used on the shuttle that could deal with heat/moisture, but sadly, required=
 a bit of force to detect stroking, which would have the caused raw tongue.=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Keeping an eye on technology, there are several companies now with the=
 tech that not only allows for moisture, but also larger work gloves and gr=
it to swipe about a smartphone. There are other enhancement techs now that =
can be incorporated and I'll get to
 that below. Interfaced with Google Glass, a person committed to a wheelcha=
ir could be free to move about their city without having a laptop affixed t=
o their chair,, a freedom from the cumbersomeness of things.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Moving the tech into other user areas, and not strictly for the disabl=
ed, TSK can incorporate saliva reading tech for various illness and also th=
e technology that reads air quality for those in the sport crowd that might=
 want to use it in their exercise/jogging
 regime and get read outs to their smartphone alerting them to things like =
&quot;the highway route you are jogging is causing a large inhalation of CO=
2 and monoxide&quot; or some such thing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The other application is the gaming world, which would give the user y=
et another &quot;hand&quot; in the game for what they do. I'm not a gamer. =
It could also be used in some capacity for up-screen technologies in a mili=
tary capacity, hands free commands/scoping for
 those with a lot in their hands.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The concept regarding Pulmonary Embolism (P.E) is really no more than =
a foam pad with sensors that goes on your car seat. It's actually a lot clo=
ser to what Orpyx does with Insoles,,, my working name for the product is &=
quot;Ass-sole&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; While picking the brains of the specialists tending my stay in the hos=
pital, which coincidently is a forerunner hospital in all things cardiac, r=
espiratory and pulmonary, they gave me a greater understanding of Electroca=
rdiograms and why they don't always
 register things. There's a commercial Google APP for a thumbed unit but th=
at is too sporadic a usage; the foam pad on the seat would be reading all b=
lood pressure, temperature changes from both legs independently during Stop=
/Go cycles, swerving, slowing, speeding,
 fidgeting of the driver. Weight shifting across our mid-rift and slumped d=
riving could also be detected in the drive. Being that their are so many bo=
dy types, there is still a general area where our ass and legs lay upon the=
 seat and would be the best area
 for bodily contact.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For fleet vehicles, the pads would be assigned a driver that workday t=
o keep their diagnostic personal; a change user feature could be interfaced=
 via a smartphone if another driver plops down on it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Minor thrombosis from sitting is commonplace but as mentioned, also a =
major cause for a range of pulmonary disorders for frequent flyers and driv=
ers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The pad, would be a first step towards future models to better underst=
and blood flow, pressure, etc... and aside from the health research, would =
assist auto manufacturers address different manner of a car seat. Future mo=
dels could incorporate many pneumatic
 inflated/deflated bladders within it to relieve pressure points and stimul=
ate blood flow, similar to hospital beds now that adjust to stave off bed s=
ores for long term laying.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Josh, the pulmonary pad concept is still very fresh and the more likel=
y of the two of moving forward with Orpyx. TSK, not as likely but I'm still=
 going to pitch it,, I really like concepts that create inclusion and only =
later seeing it's potential for gamers
 or the fit-bit crowd, think I might be able to farm it out further,, so if=
 it fails at Orpyx, I'll be sending you a &quot;Hello from the future&quot;=
 email.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you have any questions further, email is sufficing well. My text au=
to-fill/correct is possessed so answering via that manner would be comical =
at best.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi Josh,<br>
&gt; &gt; The company I will be approaching for my two projects is Orpyx. W=
hen I opened your email last week, there were two very glaring reasons why =
I think you should connect with this company; firstly, they have the sensor=
 technology specific to diabetes as that's
 the core of what they address. Secondly, they are well underway, on the ot=
her side of the fence on all the medical/hospital bureaucracy for lack of b=
etter words. I'll post their web link below, for you to get a feel for them=
 and I can't express this enough,
 look at their team. Being that your concept is much closer to their core a=
ddress than to mine, you could approach them solo,, I had thought about tag=
 teaming your concept along with mine but then reconsidered this as it tend=
s to muddle focus, nobody really
 likes pot pourri.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I'll just nutshell my two concepts here as my presentations are i=
n a format specific to Orpyx. Initially, the reason I wanted to reach out t=
o them regards a concept I had in 2004, had an oral evaluation by James Lev=
ine at Watson Labs and was deemed of (at
 that time) that the technology needed wasn't yet available. Over the years=
 since then, not only has the tech come to par but exceeded it with other t=
echnologies that can be worked in, and of course Big Data and all such thin=
gs. That concept is to assist paraplegics
 and quadriplegics not only maneuver their equipment and chairs with greate=
r ease but affordably manipulate their mouse on their computer and/or smart=
phone at near par of you or I. Other aspects of that unit would provide rea=
l-time data of their immediate health
 and covid or similar to their doctors or researchers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The second concept has real-world background; this past July, aft=
er a series of tests to figure out something with irregularities in my hear=
t function, I caught on that something was about to occur following a test.=
 Went to emergency and they took me directly
 into the hospital where I spent a week. The doctors said that; had I ignor=
ed what was happening and went to bed, I would have either awoken while hav=
ing a stroke, woken with a stroke or not woken at all. Very sobering. What =
was funny was, I was to have a teleconferencing
 regarding the other concept with a venture firm that were going to help me=
 see other avenues in my presentation of it. But there I laid in a hospital=
 bed, not only picking the specialists brains for my own health but to bett=
er understand to better address
 how to have others avert such a catastrophe.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The reason for my near stroke; all the tests that were being perf=
ormed regarded my heart, which tests kept coming back as very healthy. It w=
as a stress test on a treadmill in the morning that kicked in my near strok=
e in the afternoon. The doctor at that
 clinic said &quot;your heart is fine, you can go home&quot;. My heart was =
fine according to the hospital specialists, however, the branches into my l=
ungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And had the cardiologists and pulmonary specialists not let me kn=
ow why this happened, I wouldn't have set out to create this concept. It wa=
s so shocking (not post-covid related anything) that I replied in half word=
s with head shakes; Excessive Driving.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; My job at that time was setting up a western office for a larger =
eastern Canadian company and involved at least 1500+ KM's a week to service=
 and acquaint with customers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Depending on body type and we hear of this common thrombosis occu=
rrence on frequent flyers, frequent driving creates a myriad of major healt=
h issues. Stepping on the gas, stopping at a red light and repeating the cy=
cles within a day, plus distance, sitting,
 creates compression. Some people get numb leg, some get heart palpitations=
,,, which, like me, were brushed off to coffee intake over the workday and =
common work stress.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That concept is fairly straightforward, but I see something other=
 in it than ones health; it can provide true big-data on what automobiles a=
re worse for long distances. This could serve companies creating fleets, or=
 auto-manufacturers redesigning car/truck
 seats, researchers better understand compression thrombosis,, it could, if=
 worked with your Indigo AI (this just popped into my head) to give other u=
nderstandings of &quot;Well Being&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Josh, last week while we were email tagging, I was being directed=
 by my doctor and another specialist to go to labs for more blood-work and =
other unpleasant tests. Because of covid, labs are backed up and it was lik=
e a scene from a bad treasure hunt movie,
 trying to get same day tests, fasting for one only not to get a test and t=
hen trying to figure out another moment to fast again, yet eat. All's good =
now before the next series of follow up work. That was last week, it was co=
mical.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I have some morning things to take care of but my afternoon is fr=
ee, as well as Tuesday and Wednesday all day.<br>

&gt; &gt; Josh, additionally, I'm going to align you with one of my oldest =
friends who is a workplace culture expert and very highly regarded in Canad=
a and that would be a good in for you to talk about indigo AI. I'll intro y=
ou on LinkedIn, expect an invitation from
 Gerry Gratton in Vancouver, sometime later today. He works with companies =
streaming culture both in office and field workers.<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi Josh, we met when I wrote you about my life with raccoons whil=
e your life was with crows,, that would be about 14 years ago. My most rece=
nt query of you was asking about companies regarding OLED.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The glucose patch is interesting as I'm just shy of opening dialo=
gue with a company regarding similar tech to address pulmonary embolism P.E=
.. It was kinda spooky in a good way seeing this email. I'll keep you in my=
 loop and brief you later on who the company
 is and a wee bit more on my project/s.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think we're safe enough to say that all is to be considered con=
fidential in brief disclosure from here on in?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Cool days ahead. Onward and upward!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Sincerely<br>
&gt; &gt; Ed Ligocki<br>

&gt; &gt; Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their network=
s in a newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. Y=
ou and I have worked together in the past; I wanted to invite you to reconn=
ect to see if we could help each other
 in the future.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Below are a few of my current projects; let me know if any strike=
 your interest, or just hit me with an update on what you're working on. Or=
 let's set up a time to chat!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; All best wishes,<br>
&gt; &gt; Josh<br>

and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that are now rem=

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing; a project to understand how t=
o use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, =
heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)<br>
