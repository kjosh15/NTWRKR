Happy to do so if you give me the address for the agent in Wyoming (as
that's where I'm moving the company TO and require the address for). I've
filled in the current address on the last page as per:

LEGALINC CORPORATE SERVICES INC.
1967 Wehrle Drive, Suite 1 #086
Buffalo NY 14221

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Much appreciated,
Josh
