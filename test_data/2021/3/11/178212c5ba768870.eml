Sam,

Let me know how I can help in figuring out who has tried to cover the
Future of Work in the audio space before - I can bring a laundry list of
senior executives to interview for this right out of the gate!

Great news about 4 more episodes of Built for Change! I'll let you know
when I hear from Accenture reg., but in the meantime do you have any idea
if/how this affects our chances for a second season?

Stoked!!
- J
