YES! Let=E2=80=99s talk about what our boundaries are: that=E2=80=99s somet=
hing I didn=E2=80=99t
grow up with consistently when I was a kid and would like to do for our
children.

And for chores, I=E2=80=99m hoping Rooster Money will help us get a framewo=
rk in
place! Even if it isn=E2=80=99t ultimately the answer (because we can=E2=80=
=99t put screen
time on the kids phones) it ought to prompt the discussion and shape the
approach. Ok?

Xoxo,
Josh
