Sounds good - just sent an invite and am looking forward to it!

Mostly I've worked with Mike Mudrey, but have spoken in front of most of
the other groups and worked with a variety of folks throughout the org;
Khatdija and Bria in the D&I group spoke with me earlier this week, Phillip
Barlag and I go way back, and I talked with your new CMO a month or two
ago. Does that help?

All best,
Josh
