OK, I have figured something out.

Sci-Grip makes a product with the designation "Sci-Grip 4SC", and this
product meets requirements set forth in the SCAQMD rules. It's still a
chemical solvent cement but the differences that make it compliant are
unknown to me. But I would assume since it's labeled as a full Sci-Grip
solvent cement product, it will function as expected.

https://www.scigripadhesives.com/scigrip-4sc-low-voc-acrylic-plastic-cement=
/

Now, we normally recommend Sci-Grip 16 because it's a syrup which is more
intuitive to apply, and has gap-filling properties due to the dissolved
plastic in the cement which remains after the cement evaporates, adding
body.

Sci-Grip 4SC is a 'water thin' formula. It's the style that I personally
prefer but comes with different rules for application. Firstly, the user
will REQUIRE a syringe or an applicator bottle with syringe tip.

Secondly, the user should not use this formula to completely fill the
pocket-glued joints. With the thick formula we recommend filling these
pockets completely. With the thinner formula I would recommend only
injecting enough cement to fill the pockets less than half-way. Perhaps
even just a third.

Thirdly, some of the joints should be side-filled to take advantage of the
capillary action of the very thin liquid cement. This is something I will
probably have to demonstrate.

I am unable to find a medium-bodied Sci-Grip cement which complies with the
relevant air quality rules.
