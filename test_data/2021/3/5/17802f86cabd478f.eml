<div>We're getting closer to funding, and at the same time are going to h=

DevOps/Analytics/etc.&=23160;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>That said, *ANY* advice you have on getting someone placed in this p=

The position is fully remote although we favor GMT and EST. We need someo=
ne who can get up to speed on AWS microservices, optimize/converting our =
existing codebase (Python backend / C=23 front end) to same while collabo=
rating on getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is an a=
bility to be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep learning =
curves.<br />
<br />
The upside is that we're currently working on DE&amp;I with the biggest c=
onstruction firm in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 500 co=
mpanies on a separate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest that I know of.=
 If we get it we'll be helping create systemic, public accountability for=
 much if not most of the =46ortune 500. To that end we feel like we'd rea=
lly benefit from some more diverse representation in our team=21=21<br />=

<br />
A year ago I wouldn't have expected to be here, but the shift to distribu=
ted workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We're seeing appetites=
 increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sharp to join the =
team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about your fee struc=
ture and how we could get started=3F<br />
<br />
=46inally - how the hell are you=3F=3F It's been a long time, and a weird=
 year. Let me know if you're game for a short call just to catch up some =
time=21=21<br />

All best,<br />
