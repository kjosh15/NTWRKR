Oh hey!
Good to connect and share thoughts!  4 things...

#1. Thanks for the deck -- lemme share internally.
#2. Re: capital raise.  I was gonna suggest indie.vc (run by Bryce Roberts
out of OATV) but they just shut the fund down
<https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09>!
#3. Re: " I keep coming back to your comment about designing my day the way
I want to live it and wrapping the work around it."

... I've heard a lot of advice about this... a good buddy of mine turned me
onto this ideas of "Life Design", which is start with the life you want to
have / the job you want to have and working backwards.

Another buddy of mine told me once "you should aspire to be the CEO of your
own interests". (which is a quote I can't get out of my mind and I feel
like I am constantly thinking about how to do this better

Lastly, an investor I talked to yesterday about my new thing (whatever it
ends up being ) said to me:
"You have to be confident, and sometimes right, but the only thing that
really matters is =E2=80=98are you excited when you wake up in the morning?=
'  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s
easy to make money, it=E2=80=99s harder to be excited about the thing that =
you=E2=80=99re
making money doing=E2=80=9D ... which I think is a pretty good North Star.

#4.  And you mentioned something about Shigeru Miyamoto (Mario creator)
being inspired by watching kids play in water + dirt + on slides etc... do
you remember where that quote came from?

Thanks, keep in touch, and lemme know how I can be helpful!
