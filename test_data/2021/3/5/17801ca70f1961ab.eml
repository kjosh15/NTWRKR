OMFG this is great, thank you so much! This is *exactly* what I needed.

We're currently talking to two candidates that seem ideal (except that one
of them is another straight white man!) I knew that getting representation
into our org would be hard, but I didn't count on how *easy* it would be to
find very good talent at a competitive price point who are very aligned
with our mission... and do not have a minority voice. From a
build-your-company perspective we need to move fast, and the easy answer is
right in front of us.

Thanks again for all of this help, Sonali. Please do let me know if you
come across any candidates that might be interested in what we're building
(I would love to hire through you!!!) and/or if I can be of any help in any
other way.

 email finds you and yours safe and healthy; it&#39;s been a hell of a year=
. <br><br>Fortunately I&#39;m writing with good news as I&#39;m looking to =
learn more about your placement services. My startup (<a href=3D"http://www=
.indigometrics.com" target=3D"_blank">www.indigometrics.com</a>) needs to h=
ire our second tech position. We&#39;re currently in the middle of getting =
our first raise, but we&#39;re profitable and want to get the interviews st=
arted.<br><br>The position is fully remote although we favor GMT and EST. W=
e need someone who can get up to speed on AWS microservices, optimize/conve=
rting our existing codebase (Python backend / C# front end) to same while c=
ollaborating on getting a full devops practice in place. Most important is =
an ability to be nimble and to take ownership of occasionally steep learnin=
g curves.<br><br>The upside is that we&#39;re currently working on DE&amp;I=
 with the biggest construction firm in the world and are negotiating to enr=
oll nearly 500 companies on a separate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest =
that I know of. If we get it we&#39;ll be helping create systemic, public a=
ccountability for much if not most of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel =
like we&#39;d really benefit from some more diverse representation in our t=
eam!!<br><br>A year ago I wouldn&#39;t have expected to be here, but the sh=
ift to distributed workforces lit a fire under our customer base. We&#39;re=
 seeing appetites increase as vaccines get distributed and need someone sha=
rp to join the team and push our perspectives. Can you tell me more about y=
our fee structure and how we could get started?<br><br>Finally - how the he=
ll are you?? It&#39;s been a long time, and a weird year. Let me know if yo=
u&#39;re game for a short call just to catch up some time!!<br><br>All best=
