Dennis,

Thanks again for the call the other day - I keep coming back to your
comment about designing my day the way I want to live it and wrapping the
work around it. With two kids and loads of space (for the time being,
anyway) this feels like the smartest piece of advice I've gotten in the
last year.

As per our conversation I'm sending you our latest deck; I'd love your
(and/or your team's) feedback! Also, you mentioned something about OATV
Brice Oriely but my notes were too cryptic to know why - does that ring a
bell?

Hope you're well; let me know if you all ever make it out to Iceland, and
keep me posted on what/how you decide to move things forward. Curious to
see what awesome new thing you build next!

Much obliged,
Josh

           <br>
           <br>We met in March 2020 at Think Coffee in what was officially =
my last in-person pre-Covid meeting. Congratulations! Two things I wanted t=
o ask you about:
           <br>
           <br>1. At the time you mentioned you were mostly focused on grow=
ing Marsbot. My contract work these days is mostly spent on retainer to sen=

 looking for partnerships and platforms they can use to differentiate. Is t=
his worth a followup conversation?
           <br>
           <br>2. I've got a startup built around metricing and managing co=
rporate culture which has been blowing up since COVID+BLM (
           <a href=3D"http://www.indigometrics.com" target=3D"_blank">www.i=
ndigometrics.com</a>). We're about to look for a seed round / Series A and =
I'd love to get your advice. Would you be willing to do a brief call reg.?
