Seems like there's significant uncertainty about question allocation
without SAP / MS Graph before launch, and a lot that's not clear on what
sort of comms are being deployed.

If that's the case, I'm happy to reach out to David Wilson directly to
offer to help however we can to get those pieces in place and to express
concern that he's going to see substandard results without them. It may be
this launch is simply to get the ball rolling and there are low
expectations... but I'm not keen to shoot for a hoop we can't hit.

Does that sound sensible?
