Joel,

Sorry we weren't able to connect well on this call; it sounded as though
you thought there were some groups that would be interested in investing in
a data-heavy play like ours and that we should connect again next week to
discuss. Take a look at the deck, and if so let me know when might be good
for you. Until then, best of luck with your internet!!

All best,
Josh
