Hey Josh, sorry for not responding earlier, my schedule and inbox as been
packed as well.

Yes I'm down to catch-up sometimes this weekend (Sunday afternoon/night
will be best). Atm, my focus has been more AI/data science research and
applying more into the financial services sector.

Best,
~Kevin
