Please fill and sign page 4 of the attached
document, FLLC-ArticlesDomestication.pdf, so I can complete
the domestication filing of H4X Industries, LLC to Wyoming. You are now my
registered agent in Wyoming (previously NY) and I have filled out the
appropriate WY address, etc. on the document.

I'd like to submit this paperwork to Wyoming as soon as possible as there
is a 30 day window from receipt of the documents from NYC to complete the
process and I'm already halfway through that period.

Thanks!
Josh Klein
