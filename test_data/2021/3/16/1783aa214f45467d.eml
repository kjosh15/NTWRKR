&gt; Laura,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Three follow ups:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) I wanted to loop back around on the introduction to your contact ab=
out the white paper (as we have a client who is interested in determining i=
f they have suitable data for a submission).=C2=A0 I just realized that the=
 abstract deadline is this week- but if
 we could have an abstract by Monday am we can make sure it=E2=80=99s consi=
dered. Here=E2=80=99s the link to the info and the place to submit. Just in=
 case they close it to entries, please send a copy to me and I will make su=
re they review it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) Similarly, it would be useful to connect to your profession working=
 on D&amp;I. I&#39;m going to be speaking to a c-suite executive of color n=
ext week who has a keen interest in the topic. We&#39;re going to discuss t=
he potential for partnering on D&amp;I as a special
 project and wanted to be able to reference her work. It would also be usef=
ul to have a gauge on her interest beforehand. I=E2=80=99m waiting to hear =
back from the Chair of the Management dept, will make intros to the designa=
ted folks as soon as I do!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3) Finally, a one-off to settle an argument between my co-founder and =
I: do you see coachability as a trait, or a state? We have devoted so much =
time to debating how to label it- and all the other ones we are focusing on=
 like grit, generosity, integrity,
 etc. Seriously- it=E2=80=99s been a major ongoing discussion!. We landed o=
n referring to them as =E2=80=9Cstrengths=E2=80=99 with the idea that stren=
gths can be developed. =E2=80=9CTraits=E2=80=9D seem immutable. And while w=
e didn=E2=80=99t consider =E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 I=E2=80=99d apply the sam=
e reasoning that it feels easier
 to tap into a strength than it does to change your state. Where did you la=
nd?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Lots of activity going on; we just signed another large multinational =
yesterday and today signed a very large blue-collar workforce (the London F=
ire Brigade), demonstrating the applicability of the platform across the fu=
ll organizational stack. That=E2=80=99s awesome!!There
 are so many interesting challenges to examine here!<br>
