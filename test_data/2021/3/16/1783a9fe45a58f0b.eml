How does early next week sound? Otherwise I could do tomorrow morning GMT -
let me know what suits you best.

Glad to hear everyone is doing well, although sorry for Lydia that school
is so difficult to get into/out of!

Curious to hear about the Innovation Channel and compare notes on the
podcast - launch date ATM is mid-April.

All best,
Josh
