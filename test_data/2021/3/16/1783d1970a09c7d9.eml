Hi Josh,

Some answers/thoughts in line below:

I'd like to make a shortlist for a Future of Work pitch. Can you help me
think through what makes a good corporate client (i.e., US/Multinational,
blue-chip/recently funded, large/small, etc. etc.)?
*Recently funded, small-medium scale, US. That said, Accenture is a great
client in that they know their audience; this is the most important thing.*

Similarly, is a pitch just a matter of having a deck?
*There is no standard here, but including demo audio is helpful. My
personal preference when receiving pitches is a simple one-sheet and some
audio (even an audio "mood board")*

Similarly,  what KPIs do most corps use to evaluate podcast success? I know
that internally World 50 has a hard time committing to things, and so
framing the W50 Podcast as a test is a great way to get them to say yes.
I'd like to suggest some initial goals to shoot for / measure against, but
don't know where to start if they're just using it internally. If they have
5k members, what sort of listen rate would be reasonably successful? *Typic=
ally
we work through publishers who receive an RFP with specific KPIs in mind.
On one recent project the KPI was literally just "make this as beautiful as
possible". I have also been on programs with a major client where there was
~10k downloads in total, and they were very pleased with that. Others just
want to share the message that they have a podcast, and care about the
number of impressions on that message, not about the podcast itself. Others
want direct response: more units sold. Long story short, the KPI is
specific to the brand, but we can help them achieve their goals with
format/messaging no matter the KPI.*

;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COSTS:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking we charge $30-40k per episode for a corporate po=
dcast like Accenture. This includes all development (creative), research, w=
riting, fact-checking, booking, equipment, shipping, production, post-produ=
ction and exclusive music. Everything it takes to execute at the level we d=

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of a work process, it varies. How=
ever, I think what you can say is something like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilded and Josh will work together t=
o build and execute a creative podcast strategy that best serves the World =
50 audience. World 50 will have full editorial approval, and will be given =
opportunities to provide feedback at checkpoints along the way. Gilded Audi=
o is a soup-to-nuts studio and handles all production logistics, including:=
 development (creative), research, writing, fact-checking, booking, equipme=
nt, shipping, production, post-production and exclusive music.<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt; This is sort of what I was getting at in our call: For our prod=
uction services work we don&#39;t distribute the shows, we don&#39;t even t=
rack numbers really (our clients do, though). We rely on a couple different=
 vendors (Distributor, Marketer) for that, and typically the clients put to=
gether a marketing plan as well. However, we can strategize together on thi=
s and help get this thing heard. Podcasting is extraordinarily competitive,=
 so it requires another budget for distribution and marketing. That said, i=
t sounds like this might be an internal podcast; if it&#39;s only distribut=
ed to members of World 50. In that case, distribution is super simple! It&#=
39;d be a private link essentially. So, long story short, we aren&#39;t a d=
ata-driven company, we are a service oriented company. Might be good to inc=
lude some clients we&#39;ve worked with instead: New York Times, JP Morgan =
Chase, Umpqua Bank, Verizon, Washington Post, Spotify, Pharell Williams, Am=
y Schumer, Invesco, Cole Haan, Cleveland Clinic and many more. <br>&gt;&gt;=

 Really glad we spoke the other day - I think I have a really good lead.<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt; I spoke on Friday with Adam Lashinsky, the former editor-in-chie=
f of Fortune who is now editor-in-chief at World 50. They&#39;re that group=
 I&#39;ve been on retainer to as an &quot;anti-McKinsey.&quot; They recentl=
y hugely expanded in size through a buyout of the G100. They&#39;re structu=
red into interest/role groups - i.e., CMO50, CTO50, CFO50, etc. etc.<br>&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt; I pitched the idea of doing a podcast interviewing leaders from each=
 group to create a series of insights to share across all the groups and he=
 loved it. He was very clear that it was exactly the kind of thing World 50=
 had been talking about doing, but was much more practical than what he had=
 considered (which was focused on interviewing outside experts).<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t; There are issues - World 50 is just on the other side of a big restructu=
ring, and aren&#39;t completely clear on what their approach to media is go=
ing forward. Adam asked for some time to socialize this internally, and the=
re is no guarantee they&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s also the risk that they&#3=
9;ll try to build it using internal resources. (Although I think this is un=
likely.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I think it&#39;s worth pitching to them mo=
re formally. I suggested to Adam that I pull together a one-pager and Adam =
said that would be super helpful. More critically, I&#39;m speaking to the =
new head of ALL the groups tomorrow afternoon - I&#39;ve worked closely wit=
h him for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
 What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing (based of=
f the Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and some # refe=
rences for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&=

t;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s =
biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic cop&quot; work that would be=
 required to interface with each group, decide on topics, coordinate with t=
he representatives and members of each group to do interviews, etc. He also=
 asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well as host. I flag all this s=
