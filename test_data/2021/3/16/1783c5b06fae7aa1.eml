Thanks for this!! And thanks again for the call on Friday; I'm super
excited to see what we can do together!

I wanted to dig into the three main ways I had noted down for us to
potentially work together. Some of this may be redundant, but given the
potential for long-term partnership I'm keen to make sure there aren't any
surprises. Please correct me anywhere herein!


1. Research collaboration. We're looking at our existing data sets to
figure out what we could support, but need a little more clarity on the
outputs.

We'd like to see a deliverable that helps companies understand how
Indigometrics is effective and accurate in measuring (and potentially in
changing) internal behaviors and values. How does that align with the kind
of research you're doing internally? Could you tell me more about what the
resulting white paper could/would include (i.e., scope/depth and potential
areas of focus'), where it might be published, and how you would be
comfortable with us using it?


2. Existing company integration. We love the idea of integrating your
coachability research into an existing customer, and have a couple in mind.
However, we would have to cover our costs by passing them on to the client.
Is this in line with your expectations, are there any limitations on the
use of your findings, and/or do you have any costs that need to be
considered?


3. New company integration. Our largest customers at the moment happen to
be through a 3rd party provider in the UK who would not be amenable to
Wharton's participation. Do you have any companies you already have a good
relationship with (such as Estee Lauder!) that we could approach? I've got
a pretty good network so don't need intros specifically, but would love to
know where to look for overlap! This feels like the best possible instance
for collaboration as it's clean slate with loads of potential upside for
both parties.


I'll be speaking to Carl Haney of Estee tomorrow, and am looking to hear
back from Laura at the end of next week to see if you have any DE&I faculty
who might be interested in a collaboration.

Finally, thanks again for bearing with me while I ask all the dumb
questions - I'm trying to get them all in up front!

All best,
Josh
