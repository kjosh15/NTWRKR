Just following up with a quick update that I spoke to both Mike and Adam
about a podcast. I initially pitched a format taking the biggest annual
topic/insight from each group that's relevant for all the other groups
to share across the organization's membership, which they really liked. Is
this something you'd want to go first on?

Separately, let me know if you can think of any member companies that might
be interested in the consortium to test data-led DE&I initiatives. We've
gotten a very positive response from our first five companies contacted and
are about to widen the net, and I'd love to make it easy to share outcomes
with your team first if possible.

All best wishes,
Josh.
