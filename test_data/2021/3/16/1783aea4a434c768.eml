Jessica,

Excellent as always to connect; sorry to have been dragging! Will double up
on the coffee next time.

Until then, here's a short blurb to facilitate an intro to Emmit McHenry:

Josh cofounded a company (Indigometrics.com) that uses peer-to-peer surveys
to make comprehensive models of behavior and belief inside of companies.
Then Covid and BLM happened and now a number of big multinationals are
looking to use it to measure the success or failure of their DE&I
initiatives. He's looking for feedback on how to improve it and who to work
with to ensure success!

Let me know what comes of the Joe Rogan pitch; would love to bring in my
Leaf.ly contact + Constellation Brands and launch something big!!

All best,
Josh
