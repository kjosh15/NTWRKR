I could do 1:30 EST Thurs or 1pm EST Friday, if either of those work for
you. Or pick a time here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest something
that works for you GMT!

We're looking at some pivotal opps (HBR case study, Wharton white paper)
and I'm trying to fund through services (5-8 companies at $250k each for a
D&I consortium) vs. raising and would love your view!

Finally, curious as always how/if I can be of help. Specifically, I'd like
an update so I can pitch your solution better to executives I'm talking to.

All best,
Josh
