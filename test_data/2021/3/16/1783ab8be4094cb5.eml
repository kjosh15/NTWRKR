Anyone on the list have any experience with starlings?

Otherwise, I'd guess you'll have to heavily mod the box design to have
different food trays for different food amounts. You may also have to do
some detection hardware changes to determine different types of coins. The
software and hardware are pretty well documented, so if you've got good
hardware and software expertise you should have a pretty good base.  Let us
know how you get on!
