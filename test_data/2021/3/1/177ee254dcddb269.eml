Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their networks in a =
newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. You and =
I have connected in the past; I wanted to invite you to reconnect to see if=
 we could help each other in the future.

Below are a few of my current =
projects; let me know if any strike your interest, or just hit me with an =
update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,
Josh

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.=
indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for =
autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if =
you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor =
Testing(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asB=
vSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project to understand how to use physically embedded =
sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and =
diabetes (and hence Covid!)

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as=
 ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology =
transformation and new innovation / product development.
