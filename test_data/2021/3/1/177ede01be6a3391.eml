Hey Elyse,

I recently heard from Mike Mudrey about his expanded remit, and he pointed
out the he and you and I should all pow-wow sometime soon!

I'm definitely looking forward to it, but figured I'd be a little
pre-emptive and ask about the recent inquiry on the W50 app about metrics
for sustaining vs. disruptive innovation. I've got a Saas platform which
does this explicitly, but obvs. don't want to shill my stuff in lieu of
member's feedback.

Given that you're helping keep the group's culture on track what do you
think is the best way to bring this up in answer to the question? Happy to
simply post the URL as a suggested alternative (being explicit it's mine),
or can contact the member directly, or could mention I'm working on a
solution that's relevant (and to please contact me for more details), or...
Let me know what you think fits your vision for the group best!

Much obliged!
- J
