Love him. Think he'd be a huge asset if we can get him for cheap on the
promise of growing pay/stock as he demonstrates value. I.e., I think our
biggest challenges would be:

1) Keeping him, esp. after year one,
2) Aligning his tech aspirations with business imperatives, and
3) Affording him as he realizes his value.

Can't think of anything negative to say about him otherwise aside from that
he's not going to add anything to our diversity. Otherwise he seems very
self motivated, has a decent grounding in the relevant tech stacks, has a
high-level understanding of devops, agile, and security, and can clearly
self-educate as needed. He's also keen on culture and structural change,
which is a big plus given Indigo's mandate.

What did you think?
