Just spoke to my friend Reshma at Seedcamp and got some interesting
feedback about our situation - long and short of it is she thinks we should
hang on and look to raise when we're at a higher ARR. If we absolutely have
to fund now go for as small a check as we're able, hopefully through an
angel.
