Josh,



It=E2=80=99s been a long time stranger. Probably a decade or more. Your nam=
e popped
up recently when I was emailing with Josh Higgins about some work related
stuff and I thought to myself it is time I reach out.



I am hoping you have managed alright during the last year. Asking about
family after a decade is a fraught subject, let alone 12 months into a
pandemic. Are you and Hulda still together, U.S. or Iceland? If you have a
moment give me an update, I would love to know how you are doing.



I am in Louisiana of all places, living in New Orleans. I took a job
teaching at LSU in the art department and am very happy. One of the better
decisions I made, I feel pretty fortunate. The art career is going well
too, getting more and more into textiles, spent 6 months in Senegal awhile
back learning weaving, and I hope to be in Ghana or the Ivory Coast for a
month or two this summer if travel is a reasonable thing, but that is
feeling doubtful.



I went back and checked my emails to see when we drifted apart and I
noticed one of the last I could find was from the summer of 2010 when you
mentioned your TV show. It was a few weeks later that I was involved in a
pretty miserable accident, a catastrophic spinal injury, fractured
clavicle, hip, pelvis, extensive nerve damage. It was a mess Josh, I don't
know if you were aware or not. The next year and some was pretty much
physical therapy, crutches, braces, and pain killers. I am not asking for
sympathy, but if it felt like I fell off the face of the earth it=E2=80=99s=
 because
I kind of did. I know we weren=E2=80=99t as close as we had once been, stil=
l those
years are hazy, and many friendships suffered because of it. Now nobody
even knows about the accident unless I mention it, though I may be beating
you in the race to become a cyborg based on the amount of titanium in me
though, so I have that going for me.



Not to awkwardly transition to business, but as I mentioned Josh Higgins
thought you might be a good person to touch base with. I think you met my
friend, the painter Kehinde Wiley, he has created a non-profit that has an
art residency in Senegal, https://blackrocksenegal.org/ , and is building
another in Lagos, Nigeria, with plans for Brazil and another Africa
outpost. Long story short is he is funding everything himself (design,
construction, dozens of staffing, local programming), and recently created
the non-profit, I am a member on the board, and he is now planning
fundraising strategies to make the organization more self-sustaining. One
thing he is considering is making a series of NFTs with funds to directly
go to Black Rock. He isn=E2=80=99t very tech savvy so I have been putting o=
ut some
feelers to find a digital artist that could help him navigate those waters
and possibly translate his work into something interesting. I should also
say, this would be more to have a conversation about ideas, possibilities,
and how to do things. Since Kehinde did the official Obama portrait he has
enough visibility it may be a smart way to capitalize on the trend and
build the non-profit endowment, he is literally spending millions on
residencies for young artists.



Do you have any suggestions of people he may want to contact? Or know
anybody I should ask? If you have ideas please let me know, if you don=E2=
=80=99t no
worries. Most importantly though I would love to hear how you are doing.
Give me an update when you have a moment.


I hope you are well my friend, much love,


Scott
