Just a quick follow up; these are the topics on my agenda to cover in our
first all-hands. Let me know what else you think is needed!

1. Does everyone know what success means for their role? Any questions? Can
you tell us what it is in your own words?

2. When is good for a second meeting to discuss OKRs (
https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and when can we set a
calendar date to revisit these quarterly?

3. When is best to schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else
over the next few weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's going?

4. Let's talk through the tools and processes everyone has found works well
for them!

5. Let's talk briefly about the company policies and values; this is core
to who we are. What is needed?

6. There is no welcome packet, yet: what was missing from the process so
far?

All best,
Josh
