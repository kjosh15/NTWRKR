Subject:  Few thoughts on employee share plans

*	Looks like we will have to spend some money on lawyers to get a
share compensation plan up and running
*	It is complicated by a need to make sure it is tax efficient (or at
least doesn't lead to an additional tax burden) in all the tax jurisdictions
we are awarding in
*	So I wonder if with Andrew we add some wording in such that "Over
the time of this contract, the Company plans to introduce an Employee and
Contractor Share Retention Scheme. At the end of [ 1 year ] contract should
you remain contracted to the Company, the Company will make an award to you
as a part of its Employee and Contractor Share Retention Scheme equal to
0.2% of the shares issued by the company as the end of your contract" .
*	Pretty loose - but don't want to spend the time or money on lawyers
at this stage?
*	Note above language would mean he wouldn't be diluted by a fund
raising over the next 12 months - so maybe want to switch it to number of
shares outstanding today
*	Need to put some numbers together - but thinking that 5% for
employees over the next 5 years maybe a bit on the low side - maybe closer
to 10% - but will put some numbers down so we can discuss
