Thanks so much for this!!! Some quick followups:

1. Is it possible to get an introduction to Anurima?

2. I've sent you an invite to our preliminary skills matrix. Are you
available the week of the 5th to discuss?

3. Natch on the .5% + 2 year tenure. Do you use a vesting period for that,
or is that just .5% up front and then another .5% for the new person after
the two year mark? I ask as I expect that would create disincentives for
moving people off the board.

Thx!!

ENORMOUSLY helpful. One of my favorite parts of being a CEO now is being
able to talk with crazy smart people such as yourself to help figure things
out. A couple follow ups:
