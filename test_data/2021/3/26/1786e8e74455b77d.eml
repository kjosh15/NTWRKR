Lachlan, meet Loreley, and Loreley, meet Lachlan - you're both starting on
April 1 at Indigometrics! As noted I'll be sending out an official
introductory email soon, but I wanted to give you both a chance to schedule
a call to connect and compare notes beforehand.

If you're looking for stuff to talk about, I suggest:

a) your vision for the company,
b) the tools you're most comfortable with,
c) the work processes you've found make you most successful,
d) the areas you really want to have an impact on.

But you could also cover football, sangria recipes, or wtf else. Just
wanted to give you a chance to chat before Chris and I are both on the line=
!

Gratefully,
Josh
