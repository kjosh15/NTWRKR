*TL;DR: We're looking to talk to angels to see if we can find one that's
very aligned with the impact Indigometrics wants to make on the world. Know
anyone?*
The long version:

Two areas for updates:

*1. Indigometrics* recently made our first two hires, so priority one has
become setting up decent infrastructure to support our growth. We're also
working on an HBR paper from our first big client, and Wharton is looking
to analyze our data and produce a white paper - both good press options to
increase our valuation and drive adoption. Finally, I've been reaching out
to C-suite executive friends of mine about using the platform for D&I, and
we're getting some pretty solid responses.

This means we're starting to see the upward tick of the hockey stick, which
for me as CEO entails a number of new areas to master. Do you have feedback
on any of the following?

- *Marketing*: how to use incipient press to increase valuation, entice
M&A, and drive demand?

- *Pricing models*: at present we're charging standard SaaS "$2.50 / head"
(at >5k users), but the long lead times and staged rollouts big companies
have are starving us for revenue in the short term. Would "$250k / year for
up to 2k users" on day one be as palatable? What else?

- *Funding*: we're profitable enough to cover costs with no new customers
(and no salary for my cofounder and I!) as of next month. D&I isn't going
away and is driving demand, and we're looking at a couple good press pieces
(HBR case study and Wharton white paper) Q2/3. Short-term funding could
really help us level up; do you advise this, and if so how/from who?

- *M&A*: My goal is to sell the company for >$50mm ASAP. What am I missing,
and how do I craft my near-term targets for this?


*2. Contracts / Podcasts / Retainer work:* short-term income *personally*
is very tight. I'm all-in on Indigometrics, but until it can produce a
salary additional work would be fantastic. Am I overlooking any
opportunities for quick-turnaround income boosts?

As always, I'm enormously obliged and hugely grateful. Let me know how I
can help you in turn!

All best wishes,
Josh
