Richard,

Thanks for offering to introduce me to Mucho (both of them!) How's this for
an intro paragraph?

Josh cofounded Indigometrics, a company which uses data modeling and an
expert learning system to model and modify employee behavior using
peer-to-peer feedback loops. He is trying to rewrite how organizations
support emergent behavior, respond to changing conditions, and nurture
optimal behaviors for all employees.

His startup is hitting the hockey stick thanks for D&I and distributed
workforces, and he's about to get an HBR case study, a Wharton white paper,
and launch a major new Accenture Podcast. In the meantime he is getting
some crazy opportunities to rewrite how a number of very large
multinationals operate at a fundamental level - and he's done zero
publicity to date.

Would you be willing to take a short call with him?

Many thanks!
Josh
