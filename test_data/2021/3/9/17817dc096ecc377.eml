Hi Josh,

Sorry about the slow reply. We've been in a difficult time on the show,
trying to figure out what the future looks like after a host and reporter
stepped down from it. So I'm going to be pretty consumed with that kind of
stuff for a while now, honestly! Sorry to not be of more help to you.

I hope you're well,
Tim
