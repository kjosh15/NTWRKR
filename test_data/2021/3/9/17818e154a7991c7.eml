The kids loved this one!! And so did I - this absolutely cracked me up!!

Othinn says thank you for the e-cards, btw. Out of curiosity, why did you
send two for each boy?

Also, O is having a bday party here this Sunday, so you may want to try
calling on Saturday.

Finally, I=E2=80=99m wondering if there is a virtual team sketching platfor=
m you
and he could use to draw together without the timeline/game format of
scriblio?

Xoxo,
Josh
