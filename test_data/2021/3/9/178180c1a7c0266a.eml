Sounds like a hell of a week. Are you looking for a host? I'm currently
co-hosting Accenture's big new business podcast (due out via T-Brand later
this month) and am looking for something long-running to be a part of.

Also, I'm in Iceland. So GMT!

Let me know how/if I can help, and in any case best of luck and all good
wishes,
Josh
