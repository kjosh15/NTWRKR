Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the next couple weeks; I'm=
 curious to hear what you're working on and to see if I can help!

All best,
Josh

Below are a few of my =

with an update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.=
indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for =
autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if =
you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor =
Testing(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asB=
vSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project to understand how to use physically embedded =
sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and =
diabetes (and hence Covid!)

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as=
 ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology =
transformation and new innovation / product development.
