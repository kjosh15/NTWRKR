Thanks! Can you give me a more complete list of the virtual mailbox
services? I.e., how many names on the mailbox, what price to forward
letters to a US or Icelandic address, do you scan everything that comes in
or do you sort for spam, etc.?

Also, you are currently my registered agent. What is the Name and physical
address for Wyoming so I can file it as part of the domestication process?

Thanks!
Josh
