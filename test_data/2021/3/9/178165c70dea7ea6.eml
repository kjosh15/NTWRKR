Hey Gustavo,

Your Whatsapp message didn't show up until I opened the app and checked
your feed explicitly - not sure what the problem is. I'll try to keep an
eye out.

For the shipping label, let me know when you'd like to drop the books off
as it's supposed to be for a prespecified day.

Haven't heard anything from the landlord. It may be they're just holding
all the checks?

Let me know when you have a rough list of stuff to buy/sell.

Glad to hear you're getting through the taxes, court dates, and related
craziness!

All best,
Josh
=E1=90=A7
