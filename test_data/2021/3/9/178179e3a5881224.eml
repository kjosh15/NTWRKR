ked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put this idea to him the=
n.<br><br>What do you think? If you&#39;re game, I need some rough pricing =
(based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a work process breakdown, and so=
me # references for Gilded. <br><br>Let me know what you think!<br><br>- J<=
br><br><br>P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;traffic c=
op&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group, decide o=
n topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each group to =
do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an EP as well=
 as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<br></div>=
