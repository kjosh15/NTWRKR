Hannah,

Good to hear from you! We've seen blue jays and other corvids using the box
(but not through a complete training process.) What birds are you
considering? As for research projects, some different school groups around
the world have launched their own boxes (Israel, most recently). Let us
know what sort of structure you're looking at and hopefully someone can
pitch in ideas!

All best,
Josh
