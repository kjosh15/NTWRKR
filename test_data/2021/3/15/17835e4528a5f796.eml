Hello Josh,

Thank you for providing that information. I just need to ask a couple more
questions so I can fill out her form for you:


   - What 2 forms of ID will she be using? (Foreign ID is okay)
   - What is the address mentioned on the ID?
   - What is her email address?


I have also included below a list of acceptable ID for the 1583 form:

Two forms of unexpired ID are required:


   - At least one ID must match the address you will be using in boxes 7a
   to 7d.
   - At least one ID must contain a photograph of the addressee (this is
   you if you are the signer of the form).


Acceptable Primary forms of ID (when current and unexpired):
To be accepted as a primary form of identification, the identification must
include a clear photograph of the individual bearer. Postal customers may
provide the following as acceptable primary forms of photo identification:

   1. U.S. Government I.D. - U.S. Government I.D. may be federal-, state-,
   or tribal-issued. Customers may provide the following:
   a. State-issued driver=E2=80=99s license.
   b. Non-driver=E2=80=99s identification card.
   c. U.S. Armed Forces card.
   d. Uniformed Service ID card.
   e. U.S. permanent resident or other identification card issued by U.S.
   Citizenship and Immigration Services.
   f. U.S. certificate of citizenship or naturalization.
   g. Identification card issued by a federally or state-recognized tribal
   nation (tribal identification card).
   2. Passport: This includes a U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, or
   foreign passport.



Acceptable Secondary Forms of ID (must be current, unexpired, and contain
the address written in Box 7 on your Form 1583):

   1. A lease, mortgage, or deed of trust.
   2. Voter or vehicle registration card.
   3. Home or vehicle insurance policy.
   4. Utility bill.
   **(electric, gas, water, telephone, or cable bill)*
   5. Form I-94, Arrival, and Departure Record.
   6. Matricula Consular (Mexico): A Matricula Consular card is an
   identification card issued by the Government of Mexico through its
   consulate offices to Mexican nationals residing outside Mexico.
   7. NEXUS (Canada): NEXUS is a joint Canada Border Services Agency and
   U.S. Customs, and Border Protection operated trusted traveler and expedi=
ted
   border control program. Customers may provide a NEXUS card as a form of
   identification for money orders. To be accepted, the NEXUS card must
   contain an identification number.
   8. U.S. University Identification: For some retail products and services
   specified in Exhibit 10.3, customers may provide a public or private U.S=
.
   university identification card as an acceptable form of photo
   identification.
   9. An additional Primary ID might be used as your Secondary ID if it was
   originally issued with the address in Box 7 printed on it.



The following IDs are NOT accepted for notarizing this document:

   - *Social Security Cards*
   - *Credit Cards*
   - *Birth Certificates*



Warm regards,



How would you rate my reply?

                <div>Hello Josh,<br><br>I will be happy to add these names =
as recipients to the account. While looking into your account I see that yo=
u are currently subscribed to our starter plan, which includes one addition=
al recipient at no extra charge. I can still all three names, however, ther=
e will be an additional charge of $10/ month for the 2 additional recipient=
s. <br><br>Please let me know if you would still like to have all three nam=
es added or if you would just like to add one name. <br><br>As another opti=
on, you may choose to upgrade your account to the standard plan (this comes=
 with 2 additional recipients) or the premium plan (which comes with 6 addi=
tional recipients.)<br><br>Please let me know how you would like to move fo=
rward.<br><br><br>Warm regards,<br></div><br>

                <div>Hello Josh,<br><br>Yes, your wife may receive her mail=
 at your PostScan Mail address. Her name will need to be added as either a =
recipient or a user on the account. Please allow me to explain the differen=
ce between a recipient and a user:<br><br>You may add additional users to a=
n account. The cost is $5 per month per additional user. An additional user=
 will have their own digital inbox with their own unique login credentials.=
 All mail addressed to an additional user will show up in their personal in=
box.<br><br>You may also add additional recipients. Each plan comes with a =
set number of additional recipients that may be added to the account at no =
additional charge. A recipient does not have their own digital inbox and do=
es not have their own login credentials; they will share login credentials =
with the main account holder. All mail addressed to additional recipients w=
ill show up in the main account holder&#39;s inbox.<br><br>She will also ne=
