Beth,

I'm considering pitching a embedded Continuous Glucose Monitoring project

Wdz8F-K_g/edit#slide=3Did.g94ec82ae12_0_281>
(I
have a chance to propose this to C-Suite executives from Apple to Nike) and
was curious if it was an area of interest to you and/or what you thought of
it. Is this something you're keen on?

I hope you and yours are doing well!!

All best,
Josh
