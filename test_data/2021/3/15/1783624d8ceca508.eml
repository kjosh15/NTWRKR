This is great, thanks!! I have a direct to IKEA, and 2nd or 3rd degree
links to many of the others. Who are Champion and HAY??

I'd like to make a shortlist for a Future of Work pitch. Can you help me
think through what makes a good corporate client (i.e., US/Multinational,
blue-chip/recently funded, large/small, etc. etc.)? Similarly, is a pitch
just a matter of having a deck? I'd like to get at least an initial list of
targets and something to send them when the Big Change comes out.

Similarly,  what KPIs do most corps use to evaluate podcast success? I know
that internally World 50 has a hard time committing to things, and so
framing the W50 Podcast as a test is a great way to get them to say yes.
I'd like to suggest some initial goals to shoot for / measure against, but
don't know where to start if they're just using it internally. If they have
5k members, what sort of listen rate would be reasonably successful?

Finally, I don't know the name of the agent, but Jordon is a great resource
if we can think of anything else we need.

Thanks!!
Josh

k it&#39;s worth pitching to them more formally. I suggested to Adam that I=
 pull together a one-pager and Adam said that would be super helpful. More =
critically, I&#39;m speaking to the new head of ALL the groups tomorrow aft=
ernoon - I&#39;ve worked closely with him for 5 years and would love to put=
 this idea to him then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think? If you&#39;re game,=
 I need some rough pricing (based off the Accenture podcast is fine), a wor=
k process breakdown, and some # references for Gilded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me =
know what you think!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - J<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Adam&#39;s biggest concern is the amount of &quot;=
traffic cop&quot; work that would be required to interface with each group,=
 decide on topics, coordinate with the representatives and members of each =
group to do interviews, etc. He also asked if I would be willing to be an E=
P as well as host. I flag all this so you can keep it in mind for pricing!<=
