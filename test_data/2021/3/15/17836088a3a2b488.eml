Thanks, Ed, Right now I've got about 5-10 hrs/week I could put towards
another project. If you can get me an outline of what you're looking for
I'm happy to make a bid, but right now most of my clients are NYC-centered
multinationals so my rate is probably on the higher end. Let me know how/if
I can help!

All best,
Josh

<p style=3D"margin:0in 0in 0pt"><span style=3D"font-size:12pt">Without too =
much background on looking for the technology in 2001 to attain a cursor/ta=
p system, there was a technology licensed from the Canadian Space Agency th=
at was used on the Canada Arm on the
 Space Shuttle. That product was a minute pressure sensitive textile called=
 Kinotex, however the drawback was its texture. So as an area/pad the tongu=
e would move about would be akin to licking canvas, causing tongue fatigue =
and cankers; the pad, or film needed
 to be smooth. Later in 2004, after an evaluation by James Levine at IBM/Wa=
tson Labs, we determined that the next closest film/pad had another drawbac=
k, moisture or saliva disrupting the pad in sensing where the tip of the to=
ngue were laying. Currently there
 are several smartphones utilising tech that not only work, or understand w=
here the user wants to swipe &amp; tap, but also in extreme water/rain/mudd=
y conditions including grit and lumpy gloves, which negates offset tongue a=
t rest, saliva and left over bits of
 food travelling about the mouth.</span></p>

blem was the tsk=E2=80=99ing or tapping and the added problem with swallowi=
ng. Tsk=E2=80=99ing is done primarily with an open mouth and is actually ea=
sier than tapping ones tongue, saying/tonguing =E2=80=9Ctadah=E2=80=9D
 also works quite well. Once the cursor is at the area one wants it to be, =
a tsk or tada-tap is needed just like a left/right click. For TSK, the pad =
- to sense the command of tsk=E2=80=99ing and tapping - it is actually the =
reverse of how we use our smartphones; the
 command for TSK is on the release from the pad, so tapping might be better=
 understood as gapping. A tsk or a tadah would be three movements; tongue a=
s cursor on pad, gap during tsk=E2=80=99ing, tongue returning to pad. Teeth=
 tapping can be introduced too, for things
 like hitting the space bar when writing a Word document, or placing copy/c=
ut text.</span></p>

 of device wanting to be used happens from a drop menu, and can be worked i=

when one swallows, the mouth closes and there is a pressure drop as well as=
 the tongue compressing upon the area where TSK is situated and some teeth =
clenching. This can be resolved in a
 number of fashion. For those with greater control of pointing their tongue=
, the area of the pad understands that it is in cursor mode or swallowing m=
ode due to it
<i>feeling </i>a smaller portion or a whole tongue compression upon the pad=
, parameters sensing the tongue over the breadth of the mouth as opposed to=
ngue focus towards ones front teeth. The other solution is a micro diaphrag=
m that detects the pressure change
 within the mouth and teeth clenching during swallowing, giving pause to TS=
K in those moments and not create some cursor nightmare on the users device=

Glass came about, I recognised that TSK could provide the user with tidier =
and more private use of their online activity and assist in the drop menu f=
or whichever platform they chose to
 use. I then started thinking about different QWERTY layouts and common let=
ter couplings to help with typing, to stave off tongue fatigue and clustere=
d information the user tsk=E2=80=99ed at. Or better put, how much area one =
needs to move their tongue about, and in
 what is the field of vision on the device; if you think about the finger m=
ouse-sensor pad that we use on our PC, the area we finger/move about is act=
ually not much bigger in area than our 4 front teeth and upper pallet.</spa=

 For others, speech therapists and human translators are required as some c=
an neither control volume from whisper to loud, and also talk with more gut=
tural back of the mouth soundings for their words. Stephen Hawkings human t=

where a common speech adaptive voice program lacks. No different than how o=
ur adaptive systems work in learning
 our voice; an in the mouth system could learn the soundings of extreme imp=
ediment of which that person is the only one who speaks their language. Cur=
rently, a human translator must learn and be with a person who wishes to vo=
calise which reduces independence
 and privacy of conversation. In other words, a hyper-version of Google tra=
nslate, that can augment a voice on their smartphone in almost real-time.</=

equired looking at my work phone for design features and wiring where I cou=

 it about as I had to use both hands for the job. I was also in a workspace=

 layouts that can be augmented to overlay the actual wiring being worked on=
. Pending where the technician is working (maybe it=E2=80=99s been upgraded=

 a movement or bring up a concurrent diagram as their head moves. Hands fre=

&gt; Hi Josh,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The concept for para/quadriplegics; is essentially a smartphone screen=
 as a dental insert similar to what hockey/football players use to stop fro=
m gnashing their teeth, though much slimmer. How we swipe and move about wi=
th our thumb on a smartphone, this
 unit assists by tongue swipe, taps, tsk&#39;ing.<br>
&gt; TSK is the concept name, Tongue Synchronised Kinetics.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Originally, it was devised on several complaints an sip &amp; puff in =
the motoring about in wheelchairs,, I then took it up a notch and worked it=
 into a mouse for a PC. The problems back then were saliva and heat on the =
sensory &quot;pad&quot;; a company was found that
 licensed the technology from the Canadian Space Agency that had a product =
used on the shuttle that could deal with heat/moisture, but sadly, required=
 a bit of force to detect stroking, which would have the caused raw tongue.=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Keeping an eye on technology, there are several companies now with the=
 tech that not only allows for moisture, but also larger work gloves and gr=
it to swipe about a smartphone. There are other enhancement techs now that =
can be incorporated and I&#39;ll get to
 that below. Interfaced with Google Glass, a person committed to a wheelcha=
ir could be free to move about their city without having a laptop affixed t=
o their chair,, a freedom from the cumbersomeness of things.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Moving the tech into other user areas, and not strictly for the disabl=
ed, TSK can incorporate saliva reading tech for various illness and also th=
e technology that reads air quality for those in the sport crowd that might=
 want to use it in their exercise/jogging
 regime and get read outs to their smartphone alerting them to things like =
&quot;the highway route you are jogging is causing a large inhalation of CO=
2 and monoxide&quot; or some such thing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The other application is the gaming world, which would give the user y=
et another &quot;hand&quot; in the game for what they do. I&#39;m not a gam=
er. It could also be used in some capacity for up-screen technologies in a =
military capacity, hands free commands/scoping for
 those with a lot in their hands.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The concept regarding Pulmonary Embolism (P.E) is really no more than =
a foam pad with sensors that goes on your car seat. It&#39;s actually a lot=
 closer to what Orpyx does with Insoles,,, my working name for the product =
is &quot;Ass-sole&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; While picking the brains of the specialists tending my stay in the hos=
pital, which coincidently is a forerunner hospital in all things cardiac, r=
espiratory and pulmonary, they gave me a greater understanding of Electroca=
rdiograms and why they don&#39;t always
 register things. There&#39;s a commercial Google APP for a thumbed unit bu=
t that is too sporadic a usage; the foam pad on the seat would be reading a=
ll blood pressure, temperature changes from both legs independently during =
Stop/Go cycles, swerving, slowing, speeding,
 fidgeting of the driver. Weight shifting across our mid-rift and slumped d=
riving could also be detected in the drive. Being that their are so many bo=
dy types, there is still a general area where our ass and legs lay upon the=
 seat and would be the best area
 for bodily contact.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For fleet vehicles, the pads would be assigned a driver that workday t=
o keep their diagnostic personal; a change user feature could be interfaced=
 via a smartphone if another driver plops down on it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Minor thrombosis from sitting is commonplace but as mentioned, also a =
major cause for a range of pulmonary disorders for frequent flyers and driv=
ers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The pad, would be a first step towards future models to better underst=
and blood flow, pressure, etc... and aside from the health research, would =
assist auto manufacturers address different manner of a car seat. Future mo=
dels could incorporate many pneumatic
 inflated/deflated bladders within it to relieve pressure points and stimul=
ate blood flow, similar to hospital beds now that adjust to stave off bed s=
ores for long term laying.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Josh, the pulmonary pad concept is still very fresh and the more likel=
y of the two of moving forward with Orpyx. TSK, not as likely but I&#39;m s=
till going to pitch it,, I really like concepts that create inclusion and o=
nly later seeing it&#39;s potential for gamers
 or the fit-bit crowd, think I might be able to farm it out further,, so if=
 it fails at Orpyx, I&#39;ll be sending you a &quot;Hello from the future&q=
uot; email.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you have any questions further, email is sufficing well. My text au=
to-fill/correct is possessed so answering via that manner would be comical =
at best.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi Josh,<br>
&gt; &gt; The company I will be approaching for my two projects is Orpyx. W=
hen I opened your email last week, there were two very glaring reasons why =
I think you should connect with this company; firstly, they have the sensor=
 technology specific to diabetes as that&#39;s
 the core of what they address. Secondly, they are well underway, on the ot=
her side of the fence on all the medical/hospital bureaucracy for lack of b=
etter words. I&#39;ll post their web link below, for you to get a feel for =
them and I can&#39;t express this enough,
 look at their team. Being that your concept is much closer to their core a=
ddress than to mine, you could approach them solo,, I had thought about tag=
 teaming your concept along with mine but then reconsidered this as it tend=
s to muddle focus, nobody really
 likes pot pourri.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll just nutshell my two concepts here as my presentations a=
re in a format specific to Orpyx. Initially, the reason I wanted to reach o=
ut to them regards a concept I had in 2004, had an oral evaluation by James=
 Levine at Watson Labs and was deemed of (at
 that time) that the technology needed wasn&#39;t yet available. Over the y=
ears since then, not only has the tech come to par but exceeded it with oth=
er technologies that can be worked in, and of course Big Data and all such =
things. That concept is to assist paraplegics
 and quadriplegics not only maneuver their equipment and chairs with greate=
r ease but affordably manipulate their mouse on their computer and/or smart=
phone at near par of you or I. Other aspects of that unit would provide rea=
l-time data of their immediate health
 and covid or similar to their doctors or researchers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The second concept has real-world background; this past July, aft=
er a series of tests to figure out something with irregularities in my hear=
t function, I caught on that something was about to occur following a test.=
 Went to emergency and they took me directly
 into the hospital where I spent a week. The doctors said that; had I ignor=
ed what was happening and went to bed, I would have either awoken while hav=
ing a stroke, woken with a stroke or not woken at all. Very sobering. What =
was funny was, I was to have a teleconferencing
 regarding the other concept with a venture firm that were going to help me=
 see other avenues in my presentation of it. But there I laid in a hospital=
 bed, not only picking the specialists brains for my own health but to bett=
er understand to better address
 how to have others avert such a catastrophe.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The reason for my near stroke; all the tests that were being perf=
ormed regarded my heart, which tests kept coming back as very healthy. It w=
as a stress test on a treadmill in the morning that kicked in my near strok=
e in the afternoon. The doctor at that
 clinic said &quot;your heart is fine, you can go home&quot;. My heart was =
fine according to the hospital specialists, however, the branches into my l=
ungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And had the cardiologists and pulmonary specialists not let me kn=
ow why this happened, I wouldn&#39;t have set out to create this concept. I=
t was so shocking (not post-covid related anything) that I replied in half =
words with head shakes; Excessive Driving.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; My job at that time was setting up a western office for a larger =
eastern Canadian company and involved at least 1500+ KM&#39;s a week to ser=
vice and acquaint with customers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Depending on body type and we hear of this common thrombosis occu=
rrence on frequent flyers, frequent driving creates a myriad of major healt=
h issues. Stepping on the gas, stopping at a red light and repeating the cy=
cles within a day, plus distance, sitting,
 creates compression. Some people get numb leg, some get heart palpitations=
,,, which, like me, were brushed off to coffee intake over the workday and =
common work stress.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That concept is fairly straightforward, but I see something other=
 in it than ones health; it can provide true big-data on what automobiles a=
re worse for long distances. This could serve companies creating fleets, or=
 auto-manufacturers redesigning car/truck
 seats, researchers better understand compression thrombosis,, it could, if=
 worked with your Indigo AI (this just popped into my head) to give other u=
nderstandings of &quot;Well Being&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Josh, last week while we were email tagging, I was being directed=
 by my doctor and another specialist to go to labs for more blood-work and =
other unpleasant tests. Because of covid, labs are backed up and it was lik=
e a scene from a bad treasure hunt movie,
 trying to get same day tests, fasting for one only not to get a test and t=
hen trying to figure out another moment to fast again, yet eat. All&#39;s g=
ood now before the next series of follow up work. That was last week, it wa=
s comical.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I have some morning things to take care of but my afternoon is fr=
ee, as well as Tuesday and Wednesday all day.<br>

&gt; &gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their network=
s in a newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. Y=
ou and I have worked together in the past; I wanted to invite you to reconn=
ect to see if we could help each other
 in the future.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Below are a few of my current projects; let me know if any strike=
 your interest, or just hit me with an update on what you&#39;re working on=
. Or let&#39;s set up a time to chat!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; All best wishes,<br>
&gt; &gt; Josh<br>

&gt; &gt; Current Projects:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; IndigoMetrics; an AI platform for autonomously managing behavior =
and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you&#39;ve got staff that are now=
 remote!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing; a project to understand how t=
o use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, =
heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Professional Services: as ever, I continue to work with senior le=
aders and teams on technology transformation and new innovation / product d=
evelopment.<br>
