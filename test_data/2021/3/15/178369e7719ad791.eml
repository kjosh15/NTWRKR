Laura,

Had a great call w/ Cade on Friday. I'm super excited to see how we can
work together!! He was clear at the outset that any DE&I work we did would
have to be faculty led - who do you suggest I connect with over there on
this topic?

Similarly, do you have time in the next week or two to talk about how such
a thing could be structured?

Really excited to move quickly on this as I've just spoken to my third
interested CTO and have another call tomorrow with one who made time very
quickly: I think there's definitely a there here...

All best wishes,
Josh

br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2) Similarly, it would be useful to connect to your profess=

 of color next week who has a keen interest in the topic. We&#39;re going t=
