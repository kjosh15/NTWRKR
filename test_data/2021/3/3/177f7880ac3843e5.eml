Thanks Gustavo - great news on the court hearing!! Sending you and your
family all best wishes.

Reg. the shipping label, did you check your spam folder? If it's not there
let me know and I'll void the order and re-submit it.

Separately, let me know if you need help coordinating with Weena on the key
(the safe has all our legal docs, identifications, etc. etc. so it's a
super critical item!) and/or how we can help with the selling / keeping of
items.

All best,
Josh
