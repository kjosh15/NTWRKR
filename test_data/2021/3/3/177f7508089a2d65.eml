That's what you get, Richard, for not attending to appearances first and
meaning second.

What a world. I'll continue to ponder how to find high-calibre conversation
at scale, though... there's got to be a better way than solely happenstance=
!

You know, it occurs to me that an element of this may be intimidation. As
popular as Rene Brown's work is I think she's on to something with the
value of vulnerability and being willing to be embarrassed for the sake of
learning and growth. Perhaps she's so well known because of the paucity of
those qualities in most people's day-to-day.
