xoxo,

P.S. I keep seeing evidence of privilege in how education is getting sliced
up, but it does make me realize that we could potentially find a highly
skilled educator who wants to live remote in a low-cost area and focus on
just a small # of children. I.e., if we had a dedicated educator who lived
in Mexico or southern spain, for example, and who was focused just on our
and another couple family's children, that would be a different
proposition. It wouldn't solve the socialization issue, but it might
provide the academic structure without requiring home schooling. Thoughts?
