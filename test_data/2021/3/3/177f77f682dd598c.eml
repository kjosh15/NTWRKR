Thanks, Megan!!

1) Congrats on the new role - should have led with this, but super excited
to see what you do at Niantic!

2) Really appreciate the advice about All Raise and will pass it along.

3) If I can ever be of any help please do let me know. I'm mostly
consulting to senior execs these days, if that's of use to you, or come to
Iceland (our new home these days) and I'll help you arrange a tour!

All best,
Josh
