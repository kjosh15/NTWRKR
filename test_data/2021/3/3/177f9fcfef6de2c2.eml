This might be a nice alternative to Kahn academy for Haakon; it has points a=
nd =E2=80=9Ctickets=E2=80=9D you can use to buy online stuff (fish, pet supp=
lies, etc.) and follows a well rounded curriculum.=20

It=E2=80=99s free for the first month and might prove to be a nice alternati=
ve for Haakon if we decide to spend more time supporting Othinn=E2=80=99s de=
sire to self-educate out of school on a platform like Kahn.=20

Either way I=E2=80=99d like to set up a similar model for both of them; even=
 if they don=E2=80=99t do much out-of-school learning, I think it=E2=80=99s a=
n increasingly relevant skill and that providing a framework and family dial=
ogue of =E2=80=9Chow=E2=80=99s your project learning X going?=E2=80=9D could=
 be really formative towards lifelong learning. What do you think?
