The wild west is right - we're in Iceland right now and the view of the
world from here is stunning...

Pick a time here <http://josh.is/scheduling> and let's set a call (my
apologies for the crazy calendar - my startup is growing fast and it's
chewing up time like crazy); I'm very very pleased to hear your wisdom and
insight!

I hope you and yours are all doing well,
Josh
