Hey Mar,

My understanding from talking to Matt is that the EP title covers a wide
variety of types of involvement, from purely advisory (such as from Jaron)
to deeply involved (such as production.) Regardless, for the kinds of
projects I'm looking to build going forward I would require the EP title.
If that works I can see the 60/40% split making sense.

All best,
Josh
