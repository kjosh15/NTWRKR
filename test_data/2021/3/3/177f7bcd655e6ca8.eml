Adam,

I'm a special advisor to the Innovating 50 group and have been lucky enough
to see you work with a number of different World 50 groups - especially
over this last year!

I wanted to catch up as I was speaking to the D&I group leads yesterday and
they were asking for suggestions on how to share content from inside the
group. I've been doing a lot of work in podcasting lately (both hosting and
production) and had been chewing on the idea of pitching a "Future of Work"
or "World 50 Insights" podcast to the team.

I suspect you've got plenty of ideas in this area and would love to hear
your thoughts and see how/if I could contribute. Do you have time for a
brief call reg. in the next couple of weeks?

All best wishes,
Josh Klein
