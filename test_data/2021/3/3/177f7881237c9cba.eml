 that second part was the real issue.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">So I walked away, and figured out how to support mys=
elf without a job. Early in the process, I was interviewed by an aspiring au=
thor named Dan Pink for his first book, 2001's <a href=3D"https://click.conv=

a>. At its essence, the book is about other people like me who didn't enjoy a=
nswering to a boss, and how technology and corporate dynamics were prompting=
 us to go it alone.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Dan Pink went on to write bestseller after bestselle=

<p style=3D"color:#333">When reflecting back on <em>Free Agent Nation</em>, D=

terviewed:</p>
<blockquote style=3D"background:#fafafa;color:#666;font-style:italic;margin-=

 economic story and more of a psychology story. It was more about people yea=
rning for having a sense of autonomy and being true to themselves and having=
 some freedom and control over their lives.</blockquote>

<p style=3D"color:#333">As I progressed deeper into my entrepreneurial journ=
ey, I'd created what I thought was a "real" company, and ended up restrictin=
g my own autonomy in the process. Not the deal I was looking for, so I walke=
d away from that as well in 2005.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Every time I did something "crazy" by leaving a seem=
ingly lucrative situation, I've gone on to exponentially greater levels of f=
inancial success and gratification. I can't accept that this is mere coincid=
ence, given that when I have the proper motivation in place, it's pretty har=
d to stop me. But you have to understand that "more money" was never the mot=
ivator.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Maybe I'm an outlier when it comes to such a strict n=

<p style=3D"color:#333">Making a lot of money is nice. And these days, a sma=
ll digital business can make loads of it. But the reasons to do it are your s=
ense of purpose, your creative mastery, and yes ... your autonomy.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Anyway, I took this trip down memory lane thanks to R=
yan Holiday's essay on autonomy being the definition of success. In it, he r=
elates how "successful" people ranging from Marcus Aurelius to Napoleon to T=
aylor Swift ended up with less freedom and happiness than you would think, b=
ecause of the trappings of extrinsic forces.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Success is often viewed as achieving more and rising=
 higher in status. But the reality is that your success will be defined by w=
hat you say no to, and what you refuse to put up with any longer.</p>

<p style=3D"color:#333">In the =E2=80=9980s, when he served as Reagan=E2=80=99=
s secretary of state, Schultz would shut the door of his office, grab a pen a=
nd paper, and declare himself unavailable for one hour. (Only the president o=
r his wife could interrupt.) In that small window, he made ample room to thi=
nk big. </p>

gin-bottom:0px;margin-top:30px">Daydream Believer</h4>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Schultz led a jam-packed life, notably holding four c=
abinet-level positions under two presidents. Commanding respect from both si=
des of the aisle, he tackled some of the greatest threats of our times, from=
 nuclear proliferation to climate change.</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">In 2017, <em>New York Times</em> journalist David Le=
onhardt shared Schultz=E2=80=99s secret sauce. As he recounts:</p>
<blockquote style=3D"background:#fafafa;color:#666;font-style:italic;margin-=
left:0;padding:20px 30px">Schultz told me that his hour of solitude was the o=
nly way he could find time to think about the strategic aspects of his job. O=
therwise, he would be constantly pulled into moment-to-moment tactical issue=
s, never able to focus on larger questions of the national interest. And the=
 only way to do great work, in any field, is to find time to consider the la=
rger questions.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"color:#333">In other words, Schultz made space for purposeful da=
ydreaming. </p>
