Khatdija, Bria,

Thanks again for a great call yesterday; I always hang up after speaking
with you completely amped to go out and change the world!! Definitely a
good sign.

As per our conversations I followed up with Adam Lashinsky and will be
having a call with Mike Mudrey early next week. I'll keep you posted.

In the meantime, I've been reflecting on where you are in the growth
journey of both W50 and the D&I group. It struck me that although I'm
moving very quickly with my data-led consortium there's no reason I can't
just feed insights to you/your members as they're discovered: much of what
we're learning already is around the impact of measurement and how
accountability in DE&I efforts affects different layers of the organization=
.

The only tricky bit is that if I bring in non-W50 members we're going to
have to do a lot of juggling to keep their material separate. The three
companies we're talking to at the moment are all coincidentally members,
but we've also gotten a couple inquiries from those who aren't.

If you had a short list of ~3-5 member companies who are large, not in
construction, telecomms, or beauty, and who you think would be interested
in tackling DE&I issues with data I'm happy to approach them first. So far
we're batting 100% on the invitations we'd extended - I'd rather prioritize
W50 members first so there are no problems with sharing with the group.

Let me know if you have any ideas, suggestions, or if I can be of any help
on the other two topics you'd mentioned!

All best wishes,
Josh
