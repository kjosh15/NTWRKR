You bet. How is Friday? If not, please suggest some times that work for you n=
ext week. It might also be helpful to me if you would go just a level deeper=
 on what exactly you might be proposing. In other words, are you suggesting t=
hat something be done by the team or more specifically that you do something=
 with the team and if so what the arrangement  might look like? No wrong ans=
wers. It would just help me think about the topic before we speak.
