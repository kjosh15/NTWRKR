v>Hey Josh,<br /><br />Since these reauthorization settings are <strong>=
determined completely by Capital One and their security protocols, we ca=
n't estimate if or when they'll change them</strong> to allow for easier=
 access to your data. I know that's not the answer you were looking for,=
 but I want to be clear so that you can make the best choice for your bu=
dgeting situation.<br /><br />If these frequent reauthorizations are too=
 burdensome and you decide to end your subscription, I completely unders=
tand. But if you'd like to try out some of our <a href=3D"https://docs.y=
ouneedabudget.com/article/32-adding-transactions">alternate transaction=
 entry methods</a> that will help you automate your accounts while relyi=
ng less on CapOne's connectivity, I wanted to share my budgeting workflo=
w in case it would be helpful for you:<br /><ol><li>I've created <a href=
=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/165-scheduled-transactions"><=
strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong></a> for recurring or predictable=
 transactions like my paycheck, rent, utilities, insurances, subscriptio=
ns like Netflix, etc. I set the date and frequency of the transaction on=
ce and YNAB automatically enters them at those intervals for me.</li><li=
>I use our <strong>mobile app</strong> to record spending while I'm out.=
 This one's always been hard to remember for me, so I keep myself discip=
lined by entering a transaction as soon as a cashier hands me the receip=
t, before I put it in my wallet.</li><li><a href=3D"http://docs.youneeda=
budget.com/article/173-file-based-import"><strong>File-Based Importing</=

/video-courses/using-your-ynab-budget/lesson-3/unit-3/#course-player">re=
concile my accounts</a> </strong>at least once a week, which ensures tha=
t their balances are 100% accurate and that no missing, incorrect, dupli=

trong>5 minutes a day</strong> between my Capital One and USAA accounts,=
 <em>maybe</em> 10 minutes if I'm reconciling all four individual accoun=
ts at once. With this method of active-entry, your budget will be <em>mo=
re</em> up to date than if you rely solely on Capital One to import your=
 transactions, and will lead to heightened awareness and prioritization=
 over your spending &amp; saving. It's worked well for me, so I hope you=
