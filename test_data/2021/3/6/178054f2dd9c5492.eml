                I'd really like to work with your team - especially given t=
he work coming down the pike with expanding my UK company to the US - but I=
'm currently looking at GreenBackTaxes' flat $500 fee and have to acknowled=
ge that my current&nbsp;contract list is going to take longer than anticipa=
ted to close. GreenBack has reviewed my situation and confirmed that they c=
an manage it, but I really like your and Aubrey's approach and small busine=
ss profile. Do you have any latitude on costs here?

                 At the current ownership level there is no reporting of th=
e UK entity required unless you gain or dispose of more than 10%, unless it=
 becomes more than 50% American owned, or if the value of it reaches a thre=

                        Thanks for this. Am I understanding it correctly th=
at if I do nothing and am later hit with a fine I am not precluded for maki=
ng the reasonable cause argument then? I ask as I'd rather undertake the ri=
sk of a $10k fee while selling the company vs. now when it is still worth n=
othing. Or am I missing some risk here?

                        The only other possibility I can imagine is to ask =
my cofounders to re-issue my shares to my LLC and close out my personal own=
ership or otherwise re-issue my shares so I can file Form 5471 now. Is this=
 taking creative license too far?

                            As for the old filings, all you are missing is =
Form 5471 in the year 2015.&nbsp; This form has a $10,000 penalty if not fi=
led and no statute of limitations.&nbsp; There are two potential options to=
 fix this.

                           <div>
                            Streamlined - very likely to be accepted and th=
e penalty is 5% of value, or for you, about $4.&nbsp; The problem is that t=
echnically you don't qualify because you are supposed to use this when you =
have an issue the past three years.&nbsp; We would need to discuss with the=
 IRS if they&nbsp;would accept&nbsp;a filing for a year older than 3 years =
ago.

                            Reasonable cause - no restriction on time perio=
d, no penalty if accepted, but these are much harder to get approved.&nbsp;=
 I cannot give you a percentage, but if I had to guess, I would say slightl=
y worse than 50/50 you are denied.

                            For us, the fee would be $3K-$5K for either opt=
ion to get it all done.&nbsp; So you have to decide if the $10K potential p=
enalty is worth a $5K best case scenario if we do one of these things.&nbsp=
; Also, if the form is discovered in the future you are not precluded from =
arguing reasonable cause at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            For the 2020 filing, I would assume same info a=
s 2019, but with maybe an FBAR and a part year NY return.&nbsp; We can prep=
are this for a fee of $1,000.

                                      <br>Good news/bad news: it looks like=
 we're still quite cash restricted in the near term (that's the bad news), =
but my company has signed a longer-term contract which ought to both genera=
te a salary + bring us to the US sooner rather than later. My co-founder ha=
s expressed interest in finding a solution for handling both our and our co=
mpany's filing - he's a UK citizen with a US wife who plans to move statesi=
de in 2021.=20
                                      <br>
                                      <br>In the meantime, what would you c=
harge to get my US taxes filed for 2020 as a one-off so I can then file Ice=
landic taxes?
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Similarly, I'd love your advice o=
n what to do about declaring my ownership of the UK startup - I co-founded =
it Dec 22nd 2015, and have 629 shares worth (drumroll...) $87.59. I.e., so =
far it's only generated losses. I'm hoping that I can simply declare this n=
ow (and ongoing) to avoid fines?

                                                   1) Pay taxes (in NYC fro=
m Jan 1-June 15th 2020 and in Iceland from June 16-Dec 31 2020)

                                                   2) Establish a working b=
usiness structure going forward. At the moment my best guess on this is to =
move my LLC to Wyoming for tax purposes; going forward I'll take payments t=
hrough the LLC and then pay myself a subset as a salary to an Icelandic LLC=
, which will be fully taxable in Iceland.

                                                  <div>
                                                   The interest in Wyoming =
is that there are no personal, corporate, or corporate gains tax. I have in=
terest in two startups I advise which are aiming for exits this year, and a=
m conducting a raise on a startup aiming at an M&amp;A exit in the next two=
 years. Iceland's double-taxation treaty stipulates that the US gets any ca=
pital gains for the first five years I am in Iceland.&nbsp;

                                                  <div>
                                                   As part of this I need t=
o determine if an S-Corp, C-Corp, or Sole-proprietor&nbsp;format makes the =
most sense - at present I am under a W-2 to Accenture (for which I will be =
filing a Form 673), but they can shift the contract to pay a C- or S-corp i=
n which case they would simply waive their taxation without the form.&nbsp;

mended the above arrangement. I now need an accountant in the US who can ma=
nage my filing there for 2020 and then going forward.
