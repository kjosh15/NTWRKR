Just got off a brief call with a founder (grid.is) here in Iceland who was
invested in by Slack. He followed the direct VC route, with Seed funding
off a 0% developed product followed by a series A.

Two things he said really stuck with me. First, that he spent half a year
just vetting potential investors before really getting into the process of
securing the investment itself. Secondly, he felt that $1mm ARR + 20% month
over month growth is a gating mechanism to seed funding. (I.e., that once
you hit that it gets a LOT easier.)

My question to you is if we can show (or better yet, contract) our existing
clients to an adoption curve that follows this? I.e., if we can get Bechtel
to agree to adopting a certain number of users each quarter, or even just
put in a gating mechanism with that rate as a default, it would let us tell
a really compelling story about growth to potential investors based solely
off the income from a few clients. I'm looking for a hockey stick graph
here.

I bring this up as I am beginning to think we're getting snubbed in part
due to our small # of clients. My concern is that potential investors
aren't convinced we're going to be able to secure clients #4-10, and don't
see the revenue growth rate based on our numbers from the existing clients
to make that worth it to them.

Thoughts?
