Is 12:30 EST this Friday ok?

In terms of what I'm looking for, I'd like to host and/or co-produce a
podcast for W50. I'm currently working with the NYTimes' T-Brand as well as
Gilded Audio, and have also worked with a team specialized in corporate
content out of Seattle - so lots of resources to draw on.

My initial thinking is that there is a ton of insight the different groups
could unlock, both for themselves but also outwardly facing, and I'd like
to work with each of them to help get resolution on what they think they
can uniquely share. Separately, I also think it would be interesting to do
a purely topical podcast across the groups, for instance on the Future of
Work, which touches all the groups' domains.

Those were my initial targets, but I expect you have some thoughts here
also. Let me know if Friday works for you and/or if we can move any other
thinking forward via email in the meantime!

All best,
Josh
