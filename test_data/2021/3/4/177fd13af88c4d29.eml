Subject: the story

=20

Just got off a brief call with a founder (grid.is <http://grid.is> ) =
here in Iceland who was invested in by Slack. He followed the direct VC =
route, with Seed funding off a 0% developed product followed by a series =
A.=20

=20

Two things he said really stuck with me. First, that he spent half a =
year just vetting potential investors before really getting into the =
process of securing the investment itself. Secondly, he felt that $1mm =
ARR + 20% month over month growth is a gating mechanism to seed funding. =
(I.e., that once you hit that it gets a LOT easier.)

=20

My question to you is if we can show (or better yet, contract) our =
existing clients to an adoption curve that follows this? I.e., if we can =
get Bechtel to agree to adopting a certain number of users each quarter, =
or even just put in a gating mechanism with that rate as a default, it =
would let us tell a really compelling story about growth to potential =
investors based solely off the income from a few clients. I'm looking =
for a hockey stick graph here.

=20

I bring this up as I am beginning to think we're getting snubbed in part =
due to our small # of clients. My concern is that potential investors =
aren't convinced we're going to be able to secure clients #4-10, and =
don't see the revenue growth rate based on our numbers from the existing =
clients to make that worth it to them.

=20

Thoughts?
