Hope you got that septic hole filled...

Where I live, there are a lot of restrictions on who can buy the SciGrip
#16. Seems like it would be possible to get some on Ebay, but we were
wondering if there exists some alternative that's not a violation of the
South California Air Quality Management rules.

Does anyone have any suggestions?
