Agreed. Most of these data are aggregate; being able to get more data on
the individual might be more compelling for a manager / from a
performance perspective. I think the larger question is if that=E2=80=99s a
direction we want to go - we have avoided it thus far and focused on larger
culture trends, which I think is ultimately in line with our mission. That
said, the individual data might be very compelling for both individuals and
managers. How hard is it to pull some examples together?
