I'm so sorry for the delay here -- I've been drowning in work this week.

Glad to hear that you're going to be in a good place by April to hire. The
UK and EU is a lot cheaper -- like 45-75k USD. So way way cheaper than the
US!

Let me get back to you this week with the material we talked about, our
contract and how we work with companies and if we have any way to move
forward with things.

Best,
S

 healthy; it&#39;s been a hell of a year. <br><br>Fortunately I&#39;m writi=
ng with good news as I&#39;m looking to learn more about your placement ser=
vices. My startup (<a href=3D"http://www.indigometrics.com" target=3D"_blan=
k">www.indigometrics.com</a>) needs to hire our second tech position. We&#3=
9;re currently in the middle of getting our first raise, but we&#39;re prof=
itable and want to get the interviews started.<br><br>The position is fully=
 remote although we favor GMT and EST. We need someone who can get up to sp=
eed on AWS microservices, optimize/converting our existing codebase (Python=
 backend / C# front end) to same while collaborating on getting a full devo=
ps practice in place. Most important is an ability to be nimble and to take=
 ownership of occasionally steep learning curves.<br><br>The upside is that=
 we&#39;re currently working on DE&amp;I with the biggest construction firm=
 in the world and are negotiating to enroll nearly 500 companies on a separ=
ate joint DE&amp;I effort - the largest that I know of. If we get it we&#39=
;ll be helping create systemic, public accountability for much if not most =
of the Fortune 500. To that end we feel like we&#39;d really benefit from s=
ome more diverse representation in our team!!<br><br>A year ago I wouldn&#3=
9;t have expected to be here, but the shift to distributed workforces lit a=
 fire under our customer base. We&#39;re seeing appetites increase as vacci=
nes get distributed and need someone sharp to join the team and push our pe=
rspectives. Can you tell me more about your fee structure and how we could =
get started?<br><br>Finally - how the hell are you?? It&#39;s been a long t=
ime, and a weird year. Let me know if you&#39;re game for a short call just=
 to catch up some time!!<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=3D"s=
