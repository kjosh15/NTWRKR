Sw33t! I was chatting with a friend yesterday (he's working direct for the
Winklevoss twins on some interesting auth stuff) and he suggested we should
check out:

See GitHub + Cloudformation
look at fluent D for logging (Splunk is like a million dollars!)
see mixpanel; handle front end interactions (vs google analytics)

I'm leaning towards GitHub instead of GitLab just b/c of simplicity. Do you
have any opinions on that and/or the above?
