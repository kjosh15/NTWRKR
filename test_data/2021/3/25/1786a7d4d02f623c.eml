Pleasure chatting with you today; really appreciate you taking the time
with your hands so full!

As per our conversation I've attached our overview deck. You can you also
watch a short video and find additional case studies at
www.indigometrics.com, but as mentioned I'd suggest kicking around our
sandbox:

http://reviews.indigometrics.com/

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$

It's got all the bells and whistles turned on (so is busier than it would
normally look) and is set for a managers' view (employees get a subset of
the first few tabs), but it'll give you the best idea of the kind of data
and dashboards you can get out of the box.

Also note that all this data is available via API if you have an internal
visualization platform or KPIs you want to match it to. Let me know if you
have any questions, and thanks again!

All best,
Josh
