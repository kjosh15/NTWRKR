Hi Josh,

Massive apology for letting your note slip down in my inbox. We're in the
thick of summit season and we are learning that attention economics is very
much real.

We've been gauging with members in the I&D community to see if they'd be
open to something like that but have come up short. We think a lot of them
are doing this internally and therefore reluctant to share their data
publicly for now. Should any tell us that they are open and willing to join
in, we'll happily connect you to them.

Again, so sorry for the delay and the outcomes so far from our
conversations. We'll stay on it and will keep you looped in as well!

Best,
Khatdija
