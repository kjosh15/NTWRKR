He very much is. Their plus program is the best we could do - and they have
a one month trial for it (after that it's $20/year for the whole family).
This allows us to set up chores, etc. and track $$ in a virtual account
(i.e., you and I actually pay out when the kids want to spend, the app just
tracks how much they "own.")

As the kids age, at some point we'll give them their own card. GoHenry (and
similar apps) let you set all kinds of controls on these, but I'm seeing an
increasing number of banks offer similar. I'd suggest we cross that bridge
when we come to it and for now focus on connecting chores and "extra
earning projects" with the save/donate/spend pots framework Rooster
provides.

Shall we do a weekend push to get Othinn's laptop and phone fully set up
and we start Rooster at the same time?

xoxo,
Josh
