Chris,

Accenture is after me for a headshot, paragraph, social links, and your
website to live on the Accenture.com/BuiltforChange (the name of the
podcast) landing page. Is the following ok by you?


"Josh is a hacker who specializes in translating technology insights into
actionable strategies, focusing on using new and emerging technologies to
create exponential improvements with the recently possible.

Currently Josh is CEO of www.Indigometrics.com, a data-led SaaS platform
for measuring and managing corporate culture. He also lives as a speaker,
writer, and advisor at www.josh.is.

Also, your point about clarifying outside vs. inside work for Indigometrics
really stuck with me. You're 100% correct, we need to encourage our
employees to have lives outside of Indigo - and the more they reinforce
each other, the better! Let me know if the above reflects that well.
