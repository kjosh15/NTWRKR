I like the idea of showing areas of greatest growth - and then breaking
that out by division. Brings up competition by omission rather that
explicitly.

I=E2=80=99ll be on the call in ~1 hr and will bring up a one-on-one call w/=
 David
then.

Am still having problems with teams; no matter how I log in it bounces me
whenever I use Skype or my son uses Minecraft. :/
