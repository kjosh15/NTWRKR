This is great, thanks so much! Let me know when we have websites to link
to; I'm looking to set up a series of posts for LinkedIn tying in quotes
from each EP, as well as a general outreach blast updating folks and
pointing them to the podcast.

In the meantime, no word as yet about the additional 4 episodes. Is this
still happening?

All best,
Josh
