Hello Josh! It=E2=80=99s been mental closing my projects but I=E2=80=99m sat=
isfied to say I=E2=80=99m leaving things in pretty good shape and I=E2=80=99=
m liberating all that brain space to start with all things indigometrics soo=
n!=20

I don=E2=80=99t have yet my indigometrics email.=20

As for onboarding, planing one on one calls with all the team is a great sta=
rt as it will give me the scope to know right from the start who does what e=
xactly. And it=E2=80=99s lovely to have a partner in crime to go through the=
 onboarding together! Please feel free to connect me with Lachlan once you c=
reate my account.=20

Are you guys using any tools for asynchronous messaging? Like loop? It=E2=80=
=99s a great way for remote teams to communicate via video and it=E2=80=99s w=
onderful for onboarding processes as team members can easily create videos (=
sharing or not their screens while still on camera) to show how to do things=
, where to find files, etc. it also greatly reduces the need to rely on zill=
ion zoom calls, which are awesome but can be overwhelming when absorbing all=
 new info when joining a new company.=20

I think the free option in Loop gives up to five minute per video.=20

I will keep thinking of other ideas!=20

I seriously can=E2=80=99t wait!
