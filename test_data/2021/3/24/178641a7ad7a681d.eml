Berg=C3=BE=C3=B3ra,

I've been talking with Tryggvi and he suggested I connect with you. For a
start, I recently moved to Iceland (from NYC) and am curious about moving
my UK-based culture analytics company <http://indigometrics.com> here.
Tryggvi mentioned you have a new tax framework for R&D that was very
favorable, for one, but I suspect there is more overlap with what you're
doing as part of =C3=8Dslandsstofa/Business Iceland. Are you available for =
a
brief call in the weeks ahead?

Med kvedju,
Josh
