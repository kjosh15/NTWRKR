Chris,

Wanted to update on the onboarding process - I did a quick scan of best
practices and while most aren't relevant to us I wanted to move forward on
the following:

1. Send them something memorable and unique to our brand

Flowers and/or a bottle of wine isn't super unique to our brand, but it'll
have a nice impact regardless!

2. Welcome email

I'll write this, but want it to include:

- clarified expectations for first day
- First day schedule
- Talk about company policies and values
- explain there is no welcome packet, yet: let's use this experience to
identify what it should have!
- Let them know what success means in their role: how they can master their
job + what they need to do.

This means we need to decide on what our expectations for the first day are
and what success means in their role:

i. For first day schedule and expectations, I would suggest that day one be
a half day, and that both you and I one-on-one with each person before
letting them one-on-one meet with each other. There's doubtless a lot of
followup that this will generate, but I don't know what it'll be - so
suggest we just attempt to keep the calendar open to help support it.

ii. For a definition of success, I've got the following for Lachlan: "To
facilitate Indigometrics' rapid growth by supporting and expanding its
technology infrastructure."

Does that work, and what do you suggest for Loreley? Let me know and I'll
send you a draft. I'll also send them an email later today to expect it
shortly.


On their first day in our one-on-ones I'd like to suggest we achieve:

3. Schedule a second meeting to discuss OKRs (
https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and set a calendar date to
revisit these quarterly:

OKRs are silicon-valley standard, but I think they'll be extremely useful
for our growth. It's also an excellent way to help focus our day 1
conversations. I'd like to suggest in my welcome letter that part of our
second meeting will be to define OKRs for their first week, first quarter,
and first year.

4. Schedule a one-on-one for everyone with everyone else over the next few
weeks to touch base and compare notes on how it's going.

5. Get feedback on the toolchain. At present I'd expected we'd use Slack
and Google Docs, but you raised Teams as an alternative. I'm strongly
disinclined to get any further into the M$ ecosystem because I really
disagree with their values and what they represent, but am happy to
entertain the conversation to see if I'm in the steep minority.

Let me know if you have any feedback on the above and I'll reach out to
everyone to get appointments scheduled and draft the welcome email!

All best,
Josh
