Brilliant! And love the idea of using Loop; could be a much more humane way
of sharing info than straight up Slack and email. Let's talk about it when
we all get together April 1!

In the meantime, do you have Signal or a similar secure messaging app I can
use to send you your new email address password?

I'm SUPER SUPER SUPER EXCITED also!!! We have so much world changing to do.
:)

All best,
Josh
