Thanks for all this! Funny you should mention Adam Grant as I'm working
closely with his People Analytics group at Wharton.

Some quick followups:

1. Do let me know if Dr. Hermundur has any other material to share, but
don't stress about getting it to me in English. My wife is equally involved
in this effort and I like having material in Icelandic I want to understand
in front of me.

2. For funding we're currently exploring a consortium of big companies to
address D&I through data (a longer conversation to be had there certainly!)
If we fill all 8 seats we may not elect for funding at all (instead funding
via consortium investment), but in all likelihood we'll be looking for
investment by this summer.

So; if you have any introductions to make I'd love to get them started now,
before money is in hand, as it helps me vet if we're aligned on little
things like the purpose of the company, growth goals, etc. before they have
checks to write.

3. Reg. introductions to funds, I'm thinking specifically of helping in
connecting Icelandic companies to US funders/CVC/JV/corporate clients, etc.
To your point, there's got to be a specific project out there where I can
deliver real value as part of the Icelandic ecosystem. My guess is that it
will be in this space.

4. Let me know when you're available to talk again; I'm curious to hear the
story about building resilience and grit - esp. if this is a data driven
insight. Now that we're working with Wharton we have a lot of scientists
wanting to test stuff on our platform...!
