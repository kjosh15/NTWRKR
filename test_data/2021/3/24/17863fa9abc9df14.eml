S=C3=A6ll!

I'm writing because, firstly, I recently moved to Iceland and am really
excited to meet amazing people here. I heard you moved back here to pay
taxes on the Ueno acquisition, which is a pretty good qualifier.

But mostly I'm writing because you wrote this
<https://loremipsum.ueno.co/room-250-6e06cedf2e42>. I am building this
company <http://www.indigometrics.com> which is being hired by a growing
number of very large companies to address their inclusion challenges. That
scares the shit out of me (which I think it should), but your article gave
me hope that it's also something we can do well.

If you're up for it I'd love to connect to chat through building a company,
your thoughts on entrepreneurialism in Iceland, and to get any advice you
see fit to give on the topic of inclusion. Let me know when/if you're
around!
