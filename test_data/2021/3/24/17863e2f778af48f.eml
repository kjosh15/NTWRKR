Been chewing on this and keep coming back to relative numbers. I.e., how
can we encourage that competition without doing an "apples to apples"
between managers? Is it possible to show a relative percentage of change
between them?

TBH, I was going to propose in our call tomorrow that I set up a call w/
David Wilson to discuss both this issue as well as to ask him some pointed
questions about why we're proving valuable to the org, how he'd like to
participate in a consortium, and what he anticipates realistically as a
growth path within Bechtel (esp. given his changing role.) Thoughts?
