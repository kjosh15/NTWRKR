Patti,

I was a mentor for SXSW and met this gentleman who's raising funds for his
short film. Do you have any pro tips I can pass along?

Hope you and the family are doing well - we're firmly ensconced in Iceland
where I'm building my startup <http://indigometrics.com>. Just signed our
third large multinational and may be looking for angel funding soon, if you
know anyone who's interested in building the future of work! What are you
up to these days?

All best wishes,
Josh

Hi Josh,

Thanks so much! I really appreciate it! Here is a quick introduction, let
me know if this works.

---

My name is Ritvik Dhavale, I am a filmmaker passionate about bringing
stories at the intersection of South Asian identity in the United States.
Being born and raised half of my life in Pune, India, and the other half in
the Bay Area lends me a unique perspective into nuances of assimilation. My
next project, HEMA, is based on my mother's experience of attempting to
assimilate into the American culture. I've included a logline some articles
to help you understand the film better.

I am currently looking to raise $20,000 for the project through
crowdfunding and grants. Please let me know if you would like to read the
script and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

*Logline: *Plunged into a country far different than hers due to her
husband=E2=80=99s job, HEMA must assimilate into the American culture, conn=
ect with
her son and find her own voice despite the language barriers.
