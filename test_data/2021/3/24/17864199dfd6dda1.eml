Andrea,

We're looking to address diversity and inclusion using our data-led culture
metrics platform <http://indigometrics.com>. Having recently moved to
Iceland I am especially keen to find a way to participate in battling
corruption here. Are you available for a brief discussion about FKA and
how/if we could collaborate?

Kve=C3=B0ja,
Josh
