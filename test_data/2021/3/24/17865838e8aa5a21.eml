Most excellent chatting with you today; really was the highlight of the
week!! Let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or
suggest something that works for you GMT.

Let's talk through how to get you set up with a similar media outreach
effort, what an article about the experience so far would look like, and
where we could get it published!

All best,
Josh
