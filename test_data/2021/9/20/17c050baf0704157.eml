In the first image, looking west (toward town, away from the Johnson=E2=80=
=99s) you can see 2 tall, thin obstructions with a sloping obstruction betw=
een them. The tall, thin obstructions are trees and the large sloping area =
is our roof. Looking east, there are some low obstructions. These are the t=
reetops between Mark and Wendy=E2=80=99s and us. <br>
<br>
In the 2nd image the antenna is above our roof and the roofline obstruction=
 and the treetops between the Johnson=E2=80=99s and us are gone, leaving on=
ly the 2 tall trees to our west as obstructions. The note re. partial obstr=
uction once a minute seems to stay the same. I think (HOPE) it=E2=80=99s ju=
st a std warning. <br>
<br>
The third Image is the antenna in its current location. The 2 rightmost tre=
es are the obstructions. I believe, since the antenna points north, that th=
e leftmost tree is out of view for the antenna. <br>
<br>
Prior to moving the antenna we showed 18 to 24 minutes of obstructed view e=
very 12 hours. Now we have 2 to 4 minutes every 12 hours!<br>
<br>
We=E2=80=99re anxious to see how the effects on our Skype/Zoom abilities an=
d will try to Skype you shortly. <br>
<br>
BTW, we had a heavy rainstorm yesterday and our dnld speed dropped to 35 to=
 75. Still very usable. Upload stayed about the same - 10 to 20.<br>
