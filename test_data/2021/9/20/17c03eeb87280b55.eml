Micro lab???? I'm super curious. Where can I learn more? Delighted to hear
you're finding balance, toe-keeping or otherwise.

Last weekend I herded sheep down out of the highlands. The weekend before I
used a chainsaw to cut up a tree. Yesterday I took my kids on a 5k hike to
see the fall colors. Life for me now is about stepping back and
appreciating the gifts in front of me while delivering on the commitments I
have today, and maybe living just a little less in the future. Iceland
gives you lots of room for your self to be, which is not where I usually
sit in relation to the heady trajectory of life as framed by progress. But
it's a gift nonetheless.
