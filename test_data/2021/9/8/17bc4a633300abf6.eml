Thanks, Larianna! I've passed on this info to the show producers.

In the meantime, it strikes me that Scott might be interested in
Indigometrics, a project I've been working on to produce statistical
analysis/metrics on employee behavior. I'm currently in discussion with
Blackrock and Blackstone around using it to monitor/manage investments - it
strikes me that given Scott's background and expertise he might have an
opinion on how to leverage the enormous amounts of unique data we're
generating.

Let me know if a call would be useful,
Josh
