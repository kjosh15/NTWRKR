I didn't work with you to file my taxes last year, when we first moved to
Iceland, and now I really wish I had! Is it possible to get an estimate for
working with you to both determine estimated taxes and to prepare for
filing for 2021?

We've lived in Iceland since June 15, 2020, and already filed taxes here
and in NY/USA (where we lived before) for 2020. I have an LLC in Wyoming
which receives all my contract payments, and then pays us a small salary
here in Iceland. My accounts are in good order, we've kept our total amount
of cash here below $10k, and I have excellent records. Let me know what's
needed next!

Looking forward to it,
Josh Klein
