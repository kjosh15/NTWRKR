Hello Joshua,

Thank you for your reply. As an early adopter of 23andMe, you were
genotyped on a previous version of our chip and don=E2=80=99t have access t=
o all
our newly released reports and features. You can now upgrade to the most
recent version of our chip - V5 - to receive the latest Health + Ancestry
Service experience. By purchasing a chip upgrade, you will receive a new
kit at a discounted rate $125. Your Chip Upgrade will be associated with
your profile, but the 14-digit barcode must be registered to your account
once you receive your Chip Upgrade kit.

Specifically, you do not have access to our newly released reports
including Chronic Kidney Disease (APOL1-Related), Type 2 Diabetes (Powered
by 23andMe research)*, Familial Hypercholesterolemia*, Bunions, Flat Feet,
and more. To see a full list of what reports you=E2=80=99d receive from a c=
hip
upgrade, visit:

*The 23andMe PGS test includes health predisposition and carrier status
reports. Health predisposition reports include both reports that meet FDA
requirements for genetic health risks and the 23andMe Type 2 Diabetes
health predisposition report which is based on 23andMe research and has not
been reviewed by the FDA. The test uses qualitative genotyping to detect
select clinically relevant variants in the genomic DNA of adults from
saliva for the purpose of reporting and interpreting genetic health risks
and reporting carrier status. It is not intended to diagnose any disease.
Your ethnicity may affect the relevance of each report and how your genetic
health risk results are interpreted. Each genetic health risk report
describes if a person has variants associated with a higher risk of
developing a disease, but does not describe a person=E2=80=99s overall risk=
 of
developing the disease. The test is not intended to tell you anything about
your current state of health, or to be used to make medical decisions,
including whether or not you should take a medication, how much of a
medication you should take, or determine any treatment. Our carrier status
reports can be used to determine carrier status, but cannot determine if
you have two copies of any genetic variant. These carrier reports are not
intended to tell you anything about your risk for developing a disease in
the future, the health of your fetus, or your newborn child's risk of
developing a particular disease later in life. For certain conditions, we
provide a single report that includes information on both carrier status
and genetic health risk. Warnings & Limitations: The 23andMe PGS Genetic
Health Risk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) is indicated for
reporting of the 185delAG and 5382insC variants in the BRCA1 gene and the
6174delT variant in the BRCA2 gene. The report describes if a woman is at
increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and if a man is at
increased risk of developing breast cancer or may be at increased risk of
developing prostate cancer. The three variants included in this report are
most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and do not represent the
majority of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in the general population. The
MUTYH-Associated Polyposis Genetic Health Risk Report is indicated for
reporting the Y179C and G396D variants in the MUTYH gene and an increased
risk for colorectal cancer. The two variants included in this report are
most common in people of Northern European descent. These reports do not
include variants in other genes linked to hereditary cancers and the
absence of variants included in these reports do not rule out the presence
of other genetic variants that may impact cancer risk. The PGS test is not
a substitute for visits to a healthcare professional for recommended
screenings or appropriate follow-up. Results should be confirmed in a
clinical setting before taking any medical action. For important
information and limitations regarding other genetic health risk reports and
carrier status reports, visit https://www.23andme.com/test-info.

Hello Joshua,

Thank you for contacting the 23andMe Team. The Type 2 Diabetes report does
not provide information about type 1 diabetes or other forms of diabetes,
such as MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) and gestational
diabetes. In addition, scientists do not yet know whether the genetic
variants included in this report are relevant for people who have already
been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes or other forms of diabetes. However,
maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle are important for your overall
health if you have type 1 diabetes. Talk to a healthcare professional if
you have any concerns about your diabetes symptoms or management.
