Might be worth talking to them at the end of the year if we have more
pipeline; Chris pointed out today that if we have no pipeline re-evaluating
valuations doesn't make any sense. Given that I'm the one who will be
devalued by their putting in more cash, but that's an argument we can have
then if need be.

Thanks for looking through this - as you noted, it's pretty wacky times for
corporate valuation, especially given all the money being thrown around for
tech startups!

Love,
Josh
