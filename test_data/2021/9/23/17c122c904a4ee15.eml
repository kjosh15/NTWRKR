Would love to connect - in fact, our f2f conversation all that time ago led
in no small part to my current company <http://indigometrics.com>, which is
now doing a bunch of D&I work. This week and next are pretty packed, but
let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work, or suggest
something that works for you GMT.

Looking forward to connecting,
Josh
