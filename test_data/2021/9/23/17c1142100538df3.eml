Boy,

There is a lot here and it appears to me to be well written. If you want, we=
 can take some time - perhaps Fri or Sat?  Indigo Metrics seems - from what l=
ittle I know - to be one of the more complex companies in this category to v=
alue. For example, you=E2=80=99re far from a one man show (have paid employe=
es), are very young in terms of customers and corporate longevity. I don=E2=80=
=99t know how mature your software is, how easily it could be subcontracted o=
ut or ifitis protected in any way. All complex, difficult-to-nail-down issue=
s.=20

I note they offer a free valuation. Is this of enough interest at this point=
 to consider, or would it be better to wait until you were a bit more mature=
 before going this route?

Let me know your thoughts here.=20


Love,
DAD
