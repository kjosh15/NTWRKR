Oh good, glad everyone is doing well. Not moving to Germany yet, especially
not after their mishandling of the vaccines nearly as badly as Spain. Both
of which make the US look like a diaper-wearing alcoholic in comparison,
but still. Right now the kids are liking school, Hulda is enrolled in a
local university program (which she gets paid to attend) and I'm building
my company out of a 14-room farmhouse with fiber internet. As long as you
ignore the weather it's pretty ideal for parents who have no time to
socialize in any case.

What about you guys? Is life returning to normal(ish)? Curious how things
look from inside the country!

xoxo,
Josh
