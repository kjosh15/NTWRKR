Natasha,

Long time no speak - I hope this stage of the pandemic finds you and yours
well!

Wanted to ask if you had a UK lawyer you could recommend; my company is
growing quickly and we're in discussion with a number of potential partners
(Blackrock, KPMG, Accenture, etc.) that could create a lot of momentum.
Before then I wanted a neutral third-party lawyer to look at all our
corporate paperwork to make sure everything is in order and that everyone
is represented properly. Do you have any suggestions/advice?

Otherwise let me know if running a company/parenting/preservation of sanity
allows a catch up call some time; it'd be good to hear how life continues
and what interesting stuff you're working on!

Gratefully,
Josh
