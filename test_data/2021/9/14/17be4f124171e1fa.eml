S=C3=B8ren, so good to speak to you earlier today; I'm hopeful we can be he=
lpful
to each other. Please do send information about your current effort and
I'll see if I can tie it into my contacts at Bloomberg and CIV:LAB as well
as for the project here in Iceland.

Separately, I've attached the overview deck for my CGM project. To
summarize, we're looking to use a scaled Baysian adaptive trial to
determine the best UI/UX elements - and in which order - best employ the
data from a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to create behavior change.
I.e., instead of starting with the data source, start with the behavior and
use rapid, scaled algorithmic testing to work backwards to ensure impact.
If it works well, the system could identify and validate a variety of new
treatment modalities, platforms, sensors and services addressing
broad-spectrum health effects (obesity, heart disease, and Covid impact,
among others.)

Very much obliged,
Josh
