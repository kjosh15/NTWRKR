Fantastic!! This made my morning. Exactly what I want to be doing at 80. :)
Although it's clear you've got a better chainsaw than I do...!

Much love,
Josh

Your mother and I got a late start, but still filled the pickup and trailer=
 - the mountain roads are so rough that if we fill the trailer too full, th=
e wood can bounce out. Home in time for a late lunch. Now it has to be spli=
t and stacked, awaiting colder weather. <br>

This is something I still enjoy doing - even at 80 =F0=9F=98=8A.=C2=A0 And,=
 even better, your mother is now enjoying helping. It becomes a fun day out=
, as long as we don=E2=80=99t try and overdo it. <br>

P.S. it was fun felling an 80 foot tall tree and having it land where we wa=
nted it. We drove right up to it (bless 4-wheel drive) to load it up. This =
is the 2nd of 2 loads from that tree. <br>
