Hey Wendy! Let me know if any of these are helpful:

# DIABETES:

For Diabetes I've used:

   - mySugr
   - Diabetes:M

I also have a good friend who's the lead developer at One Drop, so do let
me know if you get a chance to look at it. FWIW, here's </> a good article
on finding an app that works for you.

# CHRONIC PAIN:

I don't have any experience with this, but these seem like good starting
points:

   - https://www.pathways.health/top-10-chronic-pain-apps/
   -
   https://uspainfoundation.org/blog/10-best-apps-for-people-with-chronic-p=
ain/

# HEART DISEASE:

Similarly I have a lack of experience here, but I have advised an
investment firm that mentioned they've matured a lot in recent years. For
example, this list:

https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/top-iphone-android-apps#ins=
tant-heart-rate

has at least one that uses the phone's camera to take readings - which'd
certainly make tracking easier!

# PARKINSONS:

Weird there are so few apps! I found these:

https://www.apdaparkinson.org/apda-symptom-tracker/
https://careclinic.io/parkinsons-tracking-app/

# OVERALL:

Personally I use these daily:

   - MyFitnessPal to track my diet,
   - Strong for lifts,
   - Runkeeper for running (they have a great couch-to-5k program),
   - Calm for meditation,
   - Sweepy for chores,
   - Stoic for journaling.

I also strongly recommend:

   - Lasting for marriage,
   - Woebot for reframing,
   - Breathwrk for breathing exercises

That said, each has many competitors so obvs. look around for one that
works for you - I've found Stoic works better for men, for example, but
that there are a number of journaling/reframing apps out there that can
make a big difference in anxiety, depression, etc.

Let me know if you end up sticking with any of the above; I hope they're
helpful!!

All best,
Josh
