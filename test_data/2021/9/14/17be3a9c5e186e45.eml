Still in Iceland? How's it going?

I'd like to solve obesity/heart disease/diabetes, and have an idea for 
tackling the problem (see attached). I'm currently getting conversations 
lined up with some folks at J&J and Novo Nordisk to see if there's an 
opportunity there. 

I wanted to ask if I could put your name on the deck as a potential 
partner, esp. given that Greg Perez isn't with IDEO anymore. Is that ok?

All best,
Josh
