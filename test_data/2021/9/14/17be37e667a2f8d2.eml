Good to hear from you! And the timing might be absolutely perfect - I=E2=80=
=99m
just finishing an email campaign designed to replace the native networking
effect of living in NYC that I=E2=80=99ve been calling the Serendipity Engi=
ne, and
I=E2=80=99m trying to figure out next steps. You might be one of a very sma=
ll
number of people who understand the market + tech well enough to help me
figure out next steps, if you=E2=80=99re willing?

Either way it=E2=80=99s be good just to catch up - having recently moved to=
 the
countryside of Iceland I=E2=80=99m keenly interested in Vermont! Let me kno=
w if any
times at josh.is/scheduling work, or suggest something that works GMT?

Looking forward to it!
- J
