John,

Excellent speaking with you earlier; I really appreciate your taking the
time!

The Katzenbach Center seems like an ideal contact, especially given their
focus on cultural transformation and the impact of behaviors.

Indigometrics provides validated statistical data on employee behaviors,
organized by the company's values. Because we provide longitudinal data
about specific behaviors at the individual, group, and corporate level -
and have a platform employees find extremely sticky for understanding same
- we're constantly finding new opportunities for high-value culture change.
We'd like to see if there's a way to collaborate.

I've attached an overview deck, and a short overview video is available her=
e
<http://indigometrics.com>. If you could let me know who best to connect
with it'd be hugely appreciated!

All best,
Josh
