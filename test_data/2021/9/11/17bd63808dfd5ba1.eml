Still in Iceland; it's been an interesting place to weather the pandemic.
How are things where you are?

Understood that you're not investing. My startup <http://indigometrics.com>
is growing well, which is rewarding, and we're starting to get enough data
for things to be really interesting indeed - longitudinal, scaled data on
actual behavior as evaluated by peers, framed by values and defined by
evolving behavior statements. Real ramifications for ESG and potentially
governance/government, all areas of increasing impact given the
geopolitical landscape. Let me know if you want to compare notes sometime;
I suspect you'd have some interesting insights!

All best wishes,
Josh
