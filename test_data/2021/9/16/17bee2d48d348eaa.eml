Huddle in your hotel room clutching your hand sanitizer? Or punch a hole in
your mask for a straw to sip your cocktails through?

Not sure. Largely rely on your vaccination, I suspect. FFS, it's Vegas -
I've only ever been there for Defcon, so it's only been firearms, federal
warrants, and mind-bending hackery to me. You'll probably have a much
better time!

I sent you an invite for Tuesday morning your time; let me know if that
works. Looking forward to it!
