at it actually is. Some declare that the term =E2=80=9CCRT=E2=80=9D should =
only apply to the original (rather obscure) academic theory, while others s=

he term=E2=80=99s actual definition is probably a big reason for the confus=
ion of the debate itself.
In this post, Vic attempts to cut through that confusion by explaining CRT =
not as a theory about racism or a collection of historical facts, but as a =
way of doing social science. Basically, he conceives of CRT as being an ana=
lysis of social science through the lens of racial power dynamics =E2=80=94=
 basically, discarding objectivity as a hopeless goal, and analyzing resear=
ch by assessing the racial interests of the researchers themselves.
I should note that I pretty strongly disagree with this idea. I=E2=80=99ve =
already written why I disagree, in a May post entitled =E2=80=9CWhy politic=

h robs us of lots of useful understanding, even if the goal of perfect obje=
ctivity is impossible.=20
But there are certainly powerful arguments on the other side of that questi=
on, and Vic is someone whose perspective I have learned never to discount. =
So read on=E2=80=A6
If you ask the average person where the Western social sciences came from, =
they=E2=80=99ll probably look at you puzzled, then mumble something about h=
ow the triumphs of the =E2=80=9Cscientific revolution=E2=80=9D led certain =
people in certain places to seek a =E2=80=9Cscience of society.=E2=80=9D As=
 with all common oversimplifications, they=E2=80=99d be right in a sense, b=
ut they=E2=80=99d be ignoring most of the story. More particularly, they=E2=
=80=99d be ignoring why a fault line of that story is core to the current =
=E2=80=9Cdebate,=E2=80=9D over critical race theory.
There are today three things floating around under the name: =E2=80=9CCriti=
cal Race Theory'': The first is the original intellectual framework out of =
legal academia; the second is educational theorists applying this intellect=
ual framework to the study of education; the third and most recent is a buf=
foonish ploy by Republicans seeking to win back Congress. Critical Race The=
ory being used to study education goes back to 1995, and didn=E2=80=99t bec=
ome a point of public controversy until it was weaponized by political oper=
atives. The buffoonish ploy relies on rhetorical pungency to generate moral=
 hysteria, but even it draws on something real and, from the standpoint of =
most American Conservatives, sincerely threatening. So, while I recognize t=
he importance of reserving to the legal framework its prerogative of actual=
ly being Critical Race Theory, we must recognize that there is more than si=
mply the adoption of a scary name at play.
What is Critical Race Theory?
Critical Race Theory=E2=80=99s founders sought to understand how a society =
that had officially disowned racism managed to continue being racist. Acade=
mically, Critical Race Theorists departed from Critical Legal Studies (CLS)=
, which arose from legal thinkers realizing that law and the courts existed=
 in the same sociological, economic, historical and political reality as th=
e rest of society. Therefore, to understand how law impacts society, we mus=
t understand how law exists in society, which means applying insights from =
the fields that study society: the social sciences. One key insight of CLS =
is that law is not just an outcome of statutory authority, nor is it a syst=
em of deductive reasoning leading objectively to one =E2=80=9Cright,=E2=80=
=9D outcome; but that the way it is applied, enforced and interpreted is an=
 outcome of social power. This insight made Critical Legal Studies a logica=
l jumping off point, within legal academia, for those seeking to understand=
 law=E2=80=99s application as an outcome of racial power.
Civil rights lawyers using legal scholarship to pursue justice in legal aca=
demia, and racial justice-minded law students demanding law schools give th=
em the resources to continue the work of generations before them, created C=
ritical Race Theory out of Critical Legal Studies.=C2=A0
Derrick Bell, the acknowledged progenitor of Critical Race Theory, who star=
ted his legal career with the NAACP=E2=80=99s legal department working unde=
r Thurgood Marshall, pioneered the study of law as an instrument of racial =
power. Law student, now professor, Kimberele Crenshaw and her comrades buil=
t on Bell=E2=80=99s insights to create an activist-intellectual movement. T=
his is Critical Race Theory=E2=80=99s dual genealogy: Social science perspe=
ctives informing the study of law meets the quest for racial justice as a f=
ramework for studying the law.=C2=A0
What all three social objects under the name =E2=80=9CCritical Race Theory,=
=E2=80=9D have in common is the idea of politicizing the allegedly apolitic=
al. The fear of politicizing the apolitical has generated the recent backla=
sh, its commitment to hyperbole notwithstanding. That the allegedly apoliti=
cal is actually always already political motivates both the legal academic =
framework and its application to understanding schools as social institutio=
ns. It=E2=80=99s notable that both sides of the recent debate claim to figh=
t in the name of objectivity. Both claim to fight for the schoolhouse as a =
place of training and learning for the betterment of society. That last par=
t, =E2=80=9Cthe betterment of society,=E2=80=9D is important, because while=
 both sides claim to be preserving the integrity of American education in t=
he name of facts, they also draw on a vision of what society should be. We =
find this explicitly in a critique of =E2=80=9Ccritical race theory=E2=80=
=9D by Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts, who said he wanted schools to teach=
 things that would =E2=80=9Cbring us together as Americans.=E2=80=9D We fin=
d this in a Tweet from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: =E2=80=9CCrit=
ical Race Theory doesn=E2=80=99t bring us together, it further sows divide =
in our country.=E2=80=9D We see this all over the Conservative side of the =
discussion, the idea that Critical Race theory, the 1619 project and anythi=
ng in their vein, are inaccurate as well as divisive. It may seem that the =
social sciences must sit quietly on the sidelines of such nakedly political=
 wrangling, facts held demurely in hand for whichever side will be bothered=
 with them. To the contrary, this is their fight and always has been.
It=E2=80=99s easy to forget that the tools we use to understand the world a=
re a part of the world; that history has a history, sociology a sociology, =
economics its own economics, political science its own political science et=
c. They are not bracketed off from the world behind a stone wall of objecti=
vity, any more than courts occupy some lofty place away from the influence =
of the powerful. The Western social sciences emerged from curiosity about h=
ow society functioned; but this curiosity became more common among the elit=
e, and was influential, funded and listened to, because of the role it coul=
d play in the social and political life of its time and place.=C2=A0
The roots of social science in the West
The time and place was 18th and 19th century Europe. Let me first free what=
 I'm about to narrate, in brief, from any claims of inherent universal sign=
ificance. Western history has global significance only because Europeans an=
d European colonists once seized power across most of the earth.=C2=A0
Out of social forces many call modernity, came the pattern of thought calle=
d =E2=80=9Cclassical liberalism." Classical liberalism, in brief, hinged on=
 a belief in human equality, and that social order should rest on this prem=
ise; that individuals are equal before the law and politically equal. It go=
es without saying that this had many exceptions in practice, and that its p=
hilosophers routinely sold-out the rights of humanity to bourgeois profits.=
 Nevertheless, new regimes built on these ideas emerged; and a new class of=
 rulers found that, having done away with feudalism=E2=80=99s intellectual =
chains forged from scripture, they needed new mental fetters that would bin=
d the masses to new states and a new social order. The nation and nationali=
sm answered this call. While the nation as an idea had been around for cent=
uries; in the West=E2=80=99s so-called age of revolutions, leaders found it=
 useful to emphasize, expand and deepen the national idea into something ca=
lled nationalism. Though royalty and nobles had long swapped Europe=E2=80=
=99s lands and peoples back and forth like private property, now, revolutio=
nary commoners could claim they belonged to captive nations crushed under t=
he boots of foreign rulers to justify revolution, to justify union into lar=
ger states and to dissolve great powers. Ernest Gellner defines nationalism=
 as the idea that the state and the nation should be identical. Gellner, Er=
ic Hobsbawm and Benedict Anderson, three of the most well known scholars of=
 nationalism, agree that a nation is a social group made up of people who t=
hink they=E2=80=99re a nation, or as Anderson would put it, who =E2=80=9Cim=
agine,=E2=80=9D they are. The new social sciences helped this process along=
, through new information about the collective pasts of groups with common =
soil, common customs and common tongues. They offered grand theories about =
what it means to be a nation, how nations come into being, how they triumph=
 and how they fall. In turn, the new nation-states made use of this deep un=
derstanding for justifying, creating and preserving social cohesion.
"Nation," and "race," formed in the same womb. The easy explanation for why=
 the peoples of the earth had different customs was that they were fundamen=
tally different. This also helped explain why, at that moment, Europeans we=
re conquering much of the globe; that it was just the natural order of thin=
gs. Scientific racism was =E2=80=9Cscientific,=E2=80=9D precisely because i=
t claimed to be =E2=80=9Csocial science,=E2=80=9D and if we define social s=
cience as what social scientists do, it frequently was. One major explanato=
ry schema of the early social sciences was =E2=80=9CSocial Darwinism.=E2=80=
=9D In fact, the phrase =E2=80=9Csurvival of the fittest,=E2=80=9D was coin=
ed, not by Charles Darwin, but by an early, now widely discredited, social =
scientist, Herbert Spencer; who believed that progress came through the sup=
erior triumphing over the inferior. This schema worked for dominant classes=
 against the classes they exploited; colonizing states against the peoples =
they colonized; nation-state majorities against the minorities they terrori=
zed and; of course, exploiting, colonizing, terrorizing, colonizing races a=
gainst the races they exploited, colonized and terrorized.=C2=A0
The social sciences therefore rose in the midst of various national project=
s and served to justify them. Their (very incomplete) transition away from =
this heritage has traced an arc similar to their growth toward greater obje=
ctivity. The legacy of this transition continues, as the social sciences bo=
th reflect and condition how the public thinks about society. The fault lin=
es of the critical race theory =E2=80=9Cdebate,=E2=80=9D reflect the fault =
lines early social science practitioners faced as they developed their disc=
iplines out of =E2=80=9Csocial philosophy,=E2=80=9D into social science. Re=
cognizing that these faults still condition our thinking about the social w=
orld is crucial to recognizing what=E2=80=99s at stake right now.
Pioneering social scientists W.E.B. Du Bois, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber d=
id their work and made their contributions in the midst of three different =
national projects. Du Bois worked amidst a nation that had lost its foundin=
g social institution, chattel slavery; to a civil war, and was now reforgin=
g its =E2=80=9Cbonds of affection,=E2=80=9D over the battered bodies of a B=
lack =E2=80=9Cnation within a nation.=E2=80=9D A captive population that, w=
hile legally included in the nation, was functionally excluded in all areas=
 of its societal life. Weber did his work as Germany was willed into being =
out of a melange of German speaking states, forcing him to grapple with the=
 basic =E2=80=9Cstuff,=E2=80=9D of nationality. Durkheim was a French Jew w=
hose French nationalism was challenged by an affair that brought ardent ant=
i-semitism forth out of the center of French nationality.
Just 24 years after the creation of Germany, in addressing a =E2=80=9CPolis=
h question,=E2=80=9D around the economic displacement of Germans by Polish =
migrants, Weber argued that social scientists should analyze economic probl=
ems with an eye to upholding the well-being of the society they live in, fo=
r =E2=80=9Creasons of state.=E2=80=9D He argued Poles were an =E2=80=9Cinfe=
rior race,=E2=80=9D that was able to outcompete civilizationally superior G=
ermans because Poles were naturally accustomed to lower standards of living=
=2E While leaving room for Polish assimi=
lation, provided not too many crossed=
 the border at once, he yet argued that the ultimate end of German economic=
 policy should be ensuring that the Germans have descendants who resemble t=
hem. This was textbook Social Darwinism. Later, particularly after consumin=
g the work of W.E.B Du Bois, and a 1904 visit to the United States where th=
ey met, established a correspondence, and secured Du Bois=E2=80=99s commitm=
ent to publish an article on the =E2=80=9CNegro problem,=E2=80=9D in a jour=
nal Weber edited; Weber came to see race less as an objective reality and m=
ore as an unscientific way of justifying human hierarchy.=C2=A0
Weber=E2=80=99s shift is interesting, because he remained a German national=
ist throughout. We may ask, what is scientific about economists and sociolo=
gists deliberately serving =E2=80=9Creasons of state?=E2=80=9D Weber=E2=80=
=99s model of scientific objectivity deals with this in part by making a di=
stinction between =E2=80=9Cends=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cmeans,=E2=80=9D the g=
oal you set and how you meet it; he argued that you may choose whatever end=
 goal you like; the social sciences are to judge if you=E2=80=99ve chosen t=
he best way to meet it, they aren=E2=80=99t to tell you what goal to pursue.
Weber was able to draw heavily on Du Bois=E2=80=99s work, because Du Bois h=
ad grappled full-time with the problem of difference within nation-states. =
The Black American sociologist started off accepting that races existed, bu=
t insisted that they were more historical and sociological than biological.=
 As early as 1897, in an address titled =E2=80=9COn the Conservation of Rac=
es,=E2=80=9D he argued that the evidence gave no quarter to a biological ta=
xonomy of racial groups; that whatever precise physical badges of race one =
found, variation within races immediately rendered false. He therefore acco=
unted for observed cultural distinctions, without quixotic flights in searc=
h of tell-tale skull measurements. He further argued that nothing about rac=
ial differences prevented groups living side by side within their own cultu=
res, or as Du Bois put it, their own =E2=80=9Cideals of life,=E2=80=9D so l=
ong as they shared broad national ideals. Unlike other social scientists, h=
e saw nothing wrong with a group functioning as a distinct social organism =
with its own institutions, while also receiving full equality in the larger=
 society. Du Bois identified the lack of such peaceful co-existence as a =
=E2=80=9Csocial problem;=E2=80=9D a term he used to describe a society fail=
ing to live up to its own ideals. Du Bois=E2=80=99s response was: Objectivi=
ty.=C2=A0
He established the first school of scientific sociology in the United State=
s as a professor at the predominantly Black Atlanta University. From his pi=
oneering study of Black Philadelphia, to yearly conferences gathering toget=
her the best research and data on the so-called =E2=80=9CNegro problem,=E2=
=80=9D Du Bois invested his boundless energy and mighty intellect into wiel=
ding facts against the lies of White race-mystics. Overtime, however, Du Bo=
is saw that he was not dealing with a simple failure of mass information, b=
ut the raw expression of racial power. If Du Bois, ever the scientist, need=
ed evidence that he dealt not with a sedate republic of reasoners, but a fr=
enzied bloodthirsty, power-mad mob, it would=E2=80=99ve been piled upon him=
, year by year, day by day, murder by murder, massacre by massacre. In resp=
onse, he turned to activism, helping to create the NAACP. Eventually, Du Bo=
is was forced to leave the NAACP because of his increasing belief that orga=
nized, voluntary separation was a superior effort to integration in the fac=
e of violent resistance.=C2=A0
France, through the French Revolution and Napoleon=E2=80=99s empire buildin=
g, played a central role in the rise of both Western social science and nat=
ionalism. The French were the first on the continent to throw off feudal sh=
ackles, and many of classical liberalism=E2=80=99s chief theorists were Fre=
nch. The idea of France as a beacon of liberty and reason to a world gropin=
g its way out of a repressive, superstitious past, was central to its natio=
nal identity. One ardent believer in this French exceptionalism was Emile D=
urkheim, another founder of sociology. Durkheim was a secular Frenchman of =
Jewish heritage, who originally argued that the collective consciousness of=
 society arose out of its economic relations, and that therefore, a society=
 organized along modern industrial economic lines would no longer have room=
 for the divisive prejudices of its past. The Dreyfus Affair, and the wave =
of riotous antisemitism it unleashed, undermined this belief and convinced =
him that the nation had to be deliberately created if it was to be rational=
 and inclusive, and that a productive national consciousness could only com=
e about through education. We may say he ended up where Du Bois started, an=
d as Du Bois but not Durkheim would live to see, in terrible revelations ou=
t of the Nazi death camps, and as we can see in today=E2=80=99s fascist res=
urgences; the problem is not nearly solved, not in America, not in Europe, =
not anywhere within the global Western excrescence.
All three men grappled with what a nation is; whether it was an organic gro=
wth out of common biology or a structure of human constitution. Du Bois and=
 Durkheim discovered the relative impotence of their ideas and research for=
 making social change, when up against the captivating power of folk unders=
tandings built on racist mysticism and pseudo-social sciences.
Weber=E2=80=99s grappling with objectivity helps us think through this impo=
tence. It=E2=80=99s worth noting that he is the only one of these three who=
 is not of a persecuted minority group, so perhaps he felt less of a stake =
in trying to redeem Western society from itself. Weber=E2=80=99s idea about=
 means and ends, that only means can be objective, not ends, sheds light on=
 the current critical race theory =E2=80=9Cdebate,=E2=80=9D as more than a =
buffoonish ploy, as a true and even informed opposition to the goal sought =
by the intellectual framework Critical Race Theory.=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CObjectivity=E2=80=9D hides a simple power struggle
Conservatives and Liberals both seek national cohesion, but differ on how t=
o achieve it, because they want it for different reasons. Conservatives see=
k to preserve the nation-state on behalf of the racial nation, what they se=
e as the European founding stock; while liberals seek to preserve it as an =
abstract legal idea which anyone can join, and whose ideals any population =
can exemplify. With these two differing "ends," the differing =E2=80=9Cmean=
s=E2=80=9D make more sense. For a Social Darwinist, social inequality resul=
ts from certain groups: classes, races etc. failing to compete effectively,=
 therefore, all society and the law owes them is an even playing field on w=
hich to keep being defeated. Even past injustices are simply less polite ex=
amples of the fittest surviving, so if the playing field is unequal because=
 of that, it's just more proof of ancestral superiority.=C2=A0
One major critique Critical Race Theory makes is of =E2=80=9Cequality befor=
e the law,=E2=80=9D as justice. These theorists argue that because law is t=
he outcome of social and racial power, =E2=80=9Cequality=E2=80=9D ultimatel=
y ends up reproducing the status quo. A Social Darwinist perspective holds =
that the status quo should be reproduced, because it has demonstrated its e=
xcellence by virtue of being in a position to impose itself. The best conce=
ssion this worldview makes to the human rights of those who lose in this wa=
r of all against all, is that they are lucky to live in victorious societie=
s, where they can eat their betters' leftovers. Social and nation-state coh=
esion, in this telling, require that they accept their places with humble g=
ratitude and a slight chance that by playing the game as the victors have l=
aid it out, they can earn one of the few spots reserved for =E2=80=9Cexcept=
ions.=E2=80=9D
Considered this way, the anti and pro-CRT camps are equally objective in th=
eir claims. They want American education and law to do different things bec=
ause they want to achieve different things with them. Even if you could con=
vince those of a Social Darwinist view that human groups are all equal and =
the West hasn=E2=80=99t conquered through genetic or cultural superiority, =
you still wouldn't necessarily convert them to the CRT, pro-racial justice =
camp. Why? Because wanting the White race to be dominant and thinking it de=
serves dominance is no no less, and certainly no more, objective than wanti=
ng the United States to survive at all. To want the existing global liberal=
 order to survive is no more or less objective than wanting a fascist White=
 ethnostate to rule Europe and the Western hemisphere while enslaving the r=
est of the globe. These are all choices we as human beings make and fight f=
or or against.

 through that confusion by explaining CRT not as a theory about racism or a=

 interests of the researchers themselves.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; fo=

 &#8220;Critical Race Theory'': The first is the original intellectual fram=
ework out of legal academia; the second is educational theorists applying t=
his intellectual framework to the study of education; the third and most re=
cent is a buffoonish ploy by Republicans seeking to win back Congress. Crit=
ical Race Theory being used to study education goes back to 1995, and didn&=
#8217;t become a point of public controversy until it was weaponized by pol=
itical operatives. The buffoonish ploy relies on rhetorical pungency to gen=
erate moral hysteria, but even it draws on something real and, from the sta=
ndpoint of most American Conservatives, sincerely threatening. So, while I =
recognize the importance of reserving to the legal framework its prerogativ=
e of actually being Critical Race Theory, we must recognize that there is m=
ore than simply the adoption of a scary name at play.</p><h3 style=3D"-moz-=

ught to understand how a society that had officially disowned racism manage=
d to continue being racist. Academically, Critical Race Theorists departed =
from Critical Legal Studies (CLS), which arose from legal thinkers realizin=
g that law and the courts existed in the same sociological, economic, histo=
rical and political reality as the rest of society. Therefore, to understan=
d how law impacts society, we must understand how law exists in society, wh=
ich means applying insights from the fields that study society: the social =
sciences. One key insight of CLS is that law is not just an outcome of stat=
utory authority, nor is it a system of deductive reasoning leading objectiv=
ely to one &#8220;right,&#8221; outcome; but that the way it is applied, en=
forced and interpreted is an outcome of social power. This insight made Cri=
tical Legal Studies a logical jumping off point, within legal academia, for=
 those seeking to understand law&#8217;s application as an outcome of racia=
l power.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;=

 working under Thurgood Marshall, pioneered the study of law as an instrume=
nt of racial power. Law student, now professor, Kimberele Crenshaw and her =
comrades built on Bell&#8217;s insights to create an activist-intellectual =
movement. This is Critical Race Theory&#8217;s dual genealogy: Social scien=
ce perspectives informing the study of law meets the quest for racial justi=
ce as a framework for studying the law.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a=

cial objects under the name &#8220;Critical Race Theory,&#8221; have in com=
mon is the idea of politicizing the allegedly apolitical. The fear of polit=
icizing the apolitical has generated the recent backlash, its commitment to=
 hyperbole notwithstanding. That the allegedly apolitical is actually alway=
s already political motivates both the legal academic framework and its app=
lication to understanding schools as social institutions. It&#8217;s notabl=
e that both sides of the recent debate claim to fight in the name of object=
ivity. Both claim to fight for the schoolhouse as a place of training and l=
earning for the betterment of society. That last part, &#8220;the bettermen=
t of society,&#8221; is important, because while both sides claim to be pre=
serving the integrity of American education in the name of facts, they also=
 draw on a vision of what society should be. We find this explicitly in a c=
ritique of &#8220;critical race theory&#8221; by Nebraska governor Pete Ric=
ketts, who said he wanted schools to teach things that would &#8220;bring u=
s together as Americans.&#8221; We find this in a Tweet from former Secreta=
ry of State Mike Pompeo: &#8220;Critical Race Theory doesn&#8217;t bring us=
 together, it further sows divide in our country.&#8221; We see this all ov=
er the Conservative side of the discussion, the idea that Critical Race the=
ory, the 1619 project and anything in their vein, are inaccurate as well as=
 divisive. It may seem that the social sciences must sit quietly on the sid=
elines of such nakedly political wrangling, facts held demurely in hand for=
 whichever side will be bothered with them. To the contrary, this is their =
fight and always has been.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; =

 science its own political science etc. They are not bracketed off from the=
 world behind a stone wall of objectivity, any more than courts occupy some=
 lofty place away from the influence of the powerful. The Western social sc=

; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">The time and place was 18th and 19th century Europe. =
Let me first free what I'm about to narrate, in brief, from any claims of i=
nherent universal significance. Western history has global significance onl=
y because Europeans and European colonists once seized power across most of=
 the earth.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-heig=
ht: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Out of social forces many call modernity, cam=
e the pattern of thought called &#8220;classical liberalism." Classical lib=
eralism, in brief, hinged on a belief in human equality, and that social or=
der should rest on this premise; that individuals are equal before the law =
and politically equal. It goes without saying that this had many exceptions=
 in practice, and that its philosophers routinely sold-out the rights of hu=
manity to bourgeois profits. Nevertheless, new regimes built on these ideas=
 emerged; and a new class of rulers found that, having done away with feuda=
lism&#8217;s intellectual chains forged from scripture, they needed new men=
tal fetters that would bind the masses to new states and a new social order=
=2E The nation and nationalism answered=20=
this call. While the nation as an ide=
a had been around for centuries; in the West&#8217;s so-called age of revol=
utions, leaders found it useful to emphasize, expand and deepen the nationa=
l idea into something called nationalism. Though royalty and nobles had lon=
g swapped Europe&#8217;s lands and peoples back and forth like private prop=
erty, now, revolutionary commoners could claim they belonged to captive nat=
ions crushed under the boots of foreign rulers to justify revolution, to ju=
stify union into larger states and to dissolve great powers. Ernest Gellner=
 defines nationalism as the idea that the state and the nation should be id=
entical. Gellner, Eric Hobsbawm and Benedict Anderson, three of the most we=
ll known scholars of nationalism, agree that a nation is a social group mad=
e up of people who think they&#8217;re a nation, or as Anderson would put i=
t, who &#8220;imagine,&#8221; they are. The new social sciences helped this=
 process along, through new information about the collective pasts of group=
s with common soil, common customs and common tongues. They offered grand t=
heories about what it means to be a nation, how nations come into being, ho=
w they triumph and how they fall. In turn, the new nation-states made use o=
f this deep understanding for justifying, creating and preserving social co=
hesion.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; =
margin: 0 0 1em 0;">"Nation," and "race," formed in the same womb. The easy=
 explanation for why the peoples of the earth had different customs was tha=
t they were fundamentally different. This also helped explain why, at that =
moment, Europeans were conquering much of the globe; that it was just the n=
atural order of things. Scientific racism was &#8220;scientific,&#8221; pre=
cisely because it claimed to be &#8220;social science,&#8221; and if we def=
ine social science as what social scientists do, it frequently was. One maj=
or explanatory schema of the early social sciences was &#8220;Social Darwin=
ism.&#8221; In fact, the phrase &#8220;survival of the fittest,&#8221; was =
coined, not by Charles Darwin, but by an early, now widely discredited, soc=
ial scientist, Herbert Spencer; who believed that progress came through the=
 superior triumphing over the inferior. This schema worked for dominant cla=
sses against the classes they exploited; colonizing states against the peop=
les they colonized; nation-state majorities against the minorities they ter=
rorized and; of course, exploiting, colonizing, terrorizing, colonizing rac=
es against the races they exploited, colonized and terrorized.&nbsp;</p><p =

rojects and served to justify them. Their (very incomplete) transition away=
 from this heritage has traced an arc similar to their growth toward greate=
r objectivity. The legacy of this transition continues, as the social scien=
ces both reflect and condition how the public thinks about society. The fau=
lt lines of the critical race theory &#8220;debate,&#8221; reflect the faul=
t lines early social science practitioners faced as they developed their di=
sciplines out of &#8220;social philosophy,&#8221; into social science. Reco=

>Pioneering social scientists W.E.B. Du Bois, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber =
did their work and made their contributions in the midst of three different=
 national projects. Du Bois worked amidst a nation that had lost its foundi=
ng social institution, chattel slavery; to a civil war, and was now reforgi=
ng its &#8220;bonds of affection,&#8221; over the battered bodies of a Blac=
k &#8220;nation within a nation.&#8221; A captive population that, while le=
gally included in the nation, was functionally excluded in all areas of its=
 societal life. Weber did his work as Germany was willed into being out of =
a melange of German speaking states, forcing him to grapple with the basic =
&#8220;stuff,&#8221; of nationality. Durkheim was a French Jew whose French=
 nationalism was challenged by an affair that brought ardent anti-semitism =
forth out of the center of French nationality.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1=
a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Just 24 years af=
ter the creation of Germany, in addressing a &#8220;Polish question,&#8221;=
 around the economic displacement of Germans by Polish migrants, Weber argu=
ed that social scientists should analyze economic problems with an eye to u=
pholding the well-being of the society they live in, for &#8220;reasons of =
state.&#8221; He argued Poles were an &#8220;inferior race,&#8221; that was=
 able to outcompete civilizationally superior Germans because Poles were na=
turally accustomed to lower standards of living. While leaving room for Pol=
ish assimilation, provided not too many crossed the border at once, he yet =
argued that the ultimate end of German economic policy should be ensuring t=
hat the Germans have descendants who resemble them. This was textbook Socia=
l Darwinism. Later, particularly after consuming the work of W.E.B Du Bois,=
 and a 1904 visit to the United States where they met, established a corres=
pondence, and secured Du Bois&#8217;s commitment to publish an article on t=
he &#8220;Negro problem,&#8221; in a journal Weber edited; Weber came to se=
e race less as an objective reality and more as an unscientific way of just=
ifying human hierarchy.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16p=
x; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Weber&#8217;s shift is interestin=
g, because he remained a German nationalist throughout. We may ask, what is=
 scientific about economists and sociologists deliberately serving &#8220;r=
easons of state?&#8221; Weber&#8217;s model of scientific objectivity deals=
 with this in part by making a distinction between &#8220;ends&#8221; and &=
#8220;means,&#8221; the goal you set and how you meet it; he argued that yo=
u may choose whatever end goal you like; the social sciences are to judge i=
f you&#8217;ve chosen the best way to meet it, they aren&#8217;t to tell yo=
u what goal to pursue.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line=
-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Weber was able to draw heavily on Du Boi=
s&#8217;s work, because Du Bois had grappled full-time with the problem of =
difference within nation-states. The Black American sociologist started off=
 accepting that races existed, but insisted that they were more historical =
and sociological than biological. As early as 1897, in an address titled &#=
8220;On the Conservation of Races,&#8221; he argued that the evidence gave =
no quarter to a biological taxonomy of racial groups; that whatever precise=
 physical badges of race one found, variation within races immediately rend=
ered false. He therefore accounted for observed cultural distinctions, with=
out quixotic flights in search of tell-tale skull measurements. He further =
argued that nothing about racial differences prevented groups living side b=
y side within their own cultures, or as Du Bois put it, their own &#8220;id=
eals of life,&#8221; so long as they shared broad national ideals. Unlike o=
ther social scientists, he saw nothing wrong with a group functioning as a =
distinct social organism with its own institutions, while also receiving fu=
ll equality in the larger society. Du Bois identified the lack of such peac=
eful co-existence as a &#8220;social problem;&#8221; a term he used to desc=
ribe a society failing to live up to its own ideals. Du Bois&#8217;s respon=
se was: Objectivity.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; =
line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">He established the first school of s=
cientific sociology in the United States as a professor at the predominantl=
y Black Atlanta University. From his pioneering study of Black Philadelphia=
, to yearly conferences gathering together the best research and data on th=
e so-called &#8220;Negro problem,&#8221; Du Bois invested his boundless ene=
rgy and mighty intellect into wielding facts against the lies of White race=
-mystics. Overtime, however, Du Bois saw that he was not dealing with a sim=
ple failure of mass information, but the raw expression of racial power. If=
 Du Bois, ever the scientist, needed evidence that he dealt not with a seda=
te republic of reasoners, but a frenzied bloodthirsty, power-mad mob, it wo=
uld&#8217;ve been piled upon him, year by year, day by day, murder by murde=
r, massacre by massacre. In response, he turned to activism, helping to cre=
ate the NAACP. Eventually, Du Bois was forced to leave the NAACP because of=
 his increasing belief that organized, voluntary separation was a superior =
effort to integration in the face of violent resistance.&nbsp;</p><p style=

>France, through the French Revolution and Napoleon&#8217;s empire building=
, played a central role in the rise of both Western social science and nati=
onalism. The French were the first on the continent to throw off feudal sha=
ckles, and many of classical liberalism&#8217;s chief theorists were French=
=2E The idea of France as a beacon of li=
berty and reason to a world groping i=
ts way out of a repressive, superstitious past, was central to its national=
 identity. One ardent believer in this French exceptionalism was Emile Durk=
heim, another founder of sociology. Durkheim was a secular Frenchman of Jew=
ish heritage, who originally argued that the collective consciousness of so=
ciety arose out of its economic relations, and that therefore, a society or=
ganized along modern industrial economic lines would no longer have room fo=
r the divisive prejudices of its past. The Dreyfus Affair, and the wave of =
riotous antisemitism it unleashed, undermined this belief and convinced him=
 that the nation had to be deliberately created if it was to be rational an=
d inclusive, and that a productive national consciousness could only come a=
bout through education. We may say he ended up where Du Bois started, and a=
s Du Bois but not Durkheim would live to see, in terrible revelations out o=
f the Nazi death camps, and as we can see in today&#8217;s fascist resurgen=
ces; the problem is not nearly solved, not in America, not in Europe, not a=
nywhere within the global Western excrescence.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1=

appled with what a nation is; whether it was an organic growth out of commo=
n biology or a structure of human constitution. Du Bois and Durkheim discov=
ered the relative impotence of their ideas and research for making social c=
hange, when up against the captivating power of folk understandings built o=
n racist mysticism and pseudo-social sciences.</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1=

appling with objectivity helps us think through this impotence. It&#8217;s =
worth noting that he is the only one of these three who is not of a persecu=
ted minority group, so perhaps he felt less of a stake in trying to redeem =
Western society from itself. Weber&#8217;s idea about means and ends, that =
only means can be objective, not ends, sheds light on the current critical =
race theory &#8220;debate,&#8221; as more than a buffoonish ploy, as a true=

line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Conservatives and Liberals both seek=
 national cohesion, but differ on how to achieve it, because they want it f=
or different reasons. Conservatives seek to preserve the nation-state on be=
half of the racial nation, what they see as the European founding stock; wh=
ile liberals seek to preserve it as an abstract legal idea which anyone can=
 join, and whose ideals any population can exemplify. With these two differ=
ing "ends," the differing &#8220;means&#8221; make more sense. For a Social=
 Darwinist, social inequality results from certain groups: classes, races e=
tc. failing to compete effectively, therefore, all society and the law owes=
 them is an even playing field on which to keep being defeated. Even past i=
njustices are simply less polite examples of the fittest surviving, so if t=
he playing field is unequal because of that, it's just more proof of ancest=
ral superiority.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line=
-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">One major critique Critical Race Theory =
makes is of &#8220;equality before the law,&#8221; as justice. These theori=
sts argue that because law is the outcome of social and racial power, &#822=
0;equality&#8221; ultimately ends up reproducing the status quo. A Social D=
arwinist perspective holds that the status quo should be reproduced, becaus=
e it has demonstrated its excellence by virtue of being in a position to im=
pose itself. The best concession this worldview makes to the human rights o=
f those who lose in this war of all against all, is that they are lucky to =
live in victorious societies, where they can eat their betters' leftovers. =
Social and nation-state cohesion, in this telling, require that they accept=
 their places with humble gratitude and a slight chance that by playing the=
 game as the victors have laid it out, they can earn one of the few spots r=
eserved for &#8220;exceptions.&#8221;</p><p style=3D"color: #1a1a1a; font-s=
ize: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Considered this way, the =
anti and pro-CRT camps are equally objective in their claims. They want Ame=
rican education and law to do different things because they want to achieve=
 different things with them. Even if you could convince those of a Social D=
arwinist view that human groups are all equal and the West hasn&#8217;t con=
quered through genetic or cultural superiority, you still wouldn't necessar=
ily convert them to the CRT, pro-racial justice camp. Why? Because wanting =
the White race to be dominant and thinking it deserves dominance is no no l=
ess, and certainly no more, objective than wanting the United States to sur=
vive at all. To want the existing global liberal order to survive is no mor=
e or less objective than wanting a fascist White ethnostate to rule Europe =
and the Western hemisphere while enslaving the rest of the globe. These are=
 all choices we as human beings make and fight for or against.</p><div styl=
