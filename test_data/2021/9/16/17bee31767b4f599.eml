Sorry to hear all this, Richard. Having been the guy running around with my
laptop frantically trying to get a spot to connect I relate strongly!

Next week is stupidly busy for me; in particular a close friend has been
diagnosed with terminal cancer and I'm expecting to connect with him in any
gaps. Can we wait until our regular time rolls around two weeks hence?

All best,
Josh
