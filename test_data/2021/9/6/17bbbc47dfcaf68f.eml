Hey Josh!
Got through all the interviews. They=E2=80=99re looking for this to be a gl=
obal
role at a higher level and it=E2=80=99s going through more scrutiny. Saidee=
p said
it will take a few more weeks to sort out.
I=E2=80=99m in a wait and see position.
On the other side, I=E2=80=99m in a pretty good position and my business pl=
an for
next year has been approved. The start-up collaboration plan is a part of
that.
Let=E2=80=99s chat in a few weeks. Hopefully, I=E2=80=99ll have clarity.
Thanks,
Kes
