Well, I read the whole article and only became more disappointed with the li=
kelihood that I (we, as a population) will remain overweight. Ugh! I=E2=80=99=
ve always been proud of the fact that I/we, as a family, never succumbed to t=
he cafeteria diet, but always ate rather healthily. Yet here we are (your mo=
ther and I, at least) overweight and finding it hard to return to our former=
 shapes (within reason, given aging etc). Heck, we even - according to the a=
rticle - have the advantage of some altitude gain (about 670 meters).

Depressing.=20

Ah well, at least we got out and got some firewood and I have begun building=
 a mesh network. Now to try the a =E2=80=9Cpermanent=E2=80=9D (I hope, but d=
oubt it) location for the Starlink antenna. I=E2=80=99m currently showing 35=
 to 40 minutes of obstructed view every 24 hours. Of course, this should imp=
rove as the leaves fall. But that only buys me time - until next spring - to=
 find a better location. It may, in the long run, require some tree amputati=
on.=20

Thanks for the article. It is certainly interesting to start to understand h=
ow complex our physiology is and how poorly we understand how it works.=20

Love,
DAD
