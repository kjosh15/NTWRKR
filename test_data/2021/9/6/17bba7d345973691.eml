As a Singularity graduate, you=E2=80=99ve already taken a key step to under=
standing
the impact of exponential tech.



But did you know that some of the most potent innovation taking place today
does not involve breakthrough technologies=E2=80=A6 but rather the creation=
 of
fundamentally new business models?

For most of history, these models were remarkably stable, dominated by a
few key ideas, upgraded by a few major variations on these themes.

In the 1920s, it was the =E2=80=9Cbait and hook=E2=80=9D model, where custo=
mers are lured
in with a low-cost initial product (the bait: a free razor) and then forced
to buy endless refills (the hook: blade refills).

In the 1950s, it was the =E2=80=9Cfranchise model=E2=80=9D pioneered by McD=
onald=E2=80=99s. Or take
the 1960s, where we got =E2=80=9Chypermarkets=E2=80=9D like Walmart.

But with the internet=E2=80=99s arrival in the 1990s, business model reinve=
ntion
entered a period of radical growth.

In less than two decades, we=E2=80=99ve seen network effects birth new plat=
forms in
record time, Bitcoin and blockchain undercut existing =E2=80=9Ctrusted thir=
d party=E2=80=9D
financial models, and crowdfunding upend the traditional ways capital is
raised.

We are now seeing 7 emerging models slated to redefine business over the
next few decades.

And today, while countless businesses are anchored by a mentality of
maintaining=E2=80=94competing solely on operational execution=E2=80=94it is=
 more vital than
ever to leverage these business models for success in the 2020s.



Each is a revolutionary new way of creating value=E2=80=94each is a force f=
or
acceleration.



*Let=E2=80=99s dive in=E2=80=A6*



*NOTE*: Understanding how to leverage exponential tech to transform your
business is a key focus of my year-round coaching program *Abundance360*

*7 BUSINESS MODELS THAT WILL RULE THE NEXT DECADE*

*(1) **The Crowd Economy**:* Crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, leveraged assets,
and staff-on-demand=E2=80=94essentially, all the developments that leverage=
 the
billions of people already online and the billions *coming* online.

All have revolutionized the way we do business. Just consider leveraged
assets, like Uber=E2=80=99s vehicles and Airbnb=E2=80=99s rooms, which have=
 allowed
companies to *scale at speed*. These crowd economy models also lean on
staff-on-demand, which provides a company with the agility needed to adapt
to a rapidly changing environment. And it=E2=80=99s everything from micro-t=
ask
laborers behind Amazon=E2=80=99s Mechanical Turk on the low end, to Kaggle=
=E2=80=99s data
scientist-on-demand services on the high end.

*Example*: Airbnb has become the largest =E2=80=9Chotel chain=E2=80=9D in t=
he world, yet it
doesn=E2=80=99t own a single hotel room. Instead, it leverages (that is, re=
nts out)
the assets (spare bedrooms) of the crowd, with more than *7 million rooms,
flats, and houses in over 100,000 cities across the globe*.



*(2) **The Free / Data Economy**:* This is the platform version of the
=E2=80=9Cbait and hook=E2=80=9D model, essentially baiting the customer wit=
h free access to
a cool service and then making money off the data gathered about that
customer. It also includes all the developments spurred by the big data
revolution, which is allowing us to exploit micro-demographics *like never
before*.

*Example*: Facebook, Google, Twitter=E2=80=94there=E2=80=99s a reason this =
model has
transformed dorm room startups into global superpowers. Google=E2=80=99s se=
arch
queries* per day* have risen from 500,000 in 1999, to 200 million in 2004,
to 3 billion in 2011, to *5.6 billion* today. While more users are becoming
aware of the valuable data they exchange in return for Google=E2=80=99s =E2=
=80=9Cfree=E2=80=9D
search service, this tried-and-true model will likely continue to succeed
in the 2020s.

*(3) **The Smartness Economy**:* In the late 1800s, if you wanted a good
idea for a new business, all you needed was to take an existing tool, say a
drill or a washboard, and add electricity to it=E2=80=94thus creating a pow=
er drill
or a washing machine.

In the 2020s, *AI will be the electricity*. In other words, take any
existing tool, and add a layer of smartness. So, cell phones became
smartphones and stereo speakers became smart speakers and cars become
autonomous vehicles.



*Example*: We all know the big names incorporating AI into their business
models=E2=80=94from Amazon to Salesforce. But more AI startups arise each d=
ay:
1,000 AI-related companies in the US raised over $27B in venture capital in
2020, according to Pitchbook. One of the most highly valued of those
companies is Scale AI, a data-labeling company that supports machine
learning teams, currently valued at $7.3B. Expect AI to continue
transforming most businesses in the 2020s.

*(4) **Closed-Loop Economies**:* In nature, nothing is ever wasted. The
detritus of one species always becomes the foundation for the survival of
another species. Human attempts to mimic these entirely waste-free systems
have been dubbed =E2=80=9Cbiomimicry=E2=80=9D (if you=E2=80=99re talking ab=
out designing a new kind
of product) or =E2=80=9Ccradle-to-cradle=E2=80=9D (if you=E2=80=99re talkin=
g about designing a new
kind of city) or, more simply, =E2=80=9Cclosed-loop economies.=E2=80=9D The=
se models will
grow increasingly prevalent with the rise of environmentally-conscious
consumers and the cost benefits of closed-loop systems.

*Example*: The Plastic Bank, founded in 2013, allows anyone to pick up
waste plastic and drop it off at a =E2=80=9Cplastic bank.=E2=80=9D The coll=
ector is then
paid for the =E2=80=9Ctrash=E2=80=9D in anything from cash to WiFi time, wh=
ile the plastic
bank sorts the material and sells it to the appropriate recycler=E2=80=94th=
us
closing an open loop in the life cycle of plastic.

*(5) **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**:* At the convergence
of blockchain and AI sits a radically new kind of company=E2=80=94one with =
no
employees, no bosses, and nonstop production. A set of preprogrammed rules
determines how the company operates, and computers do the rest. A fleet of
autonomous taxis, for instance, with a blockchain-backed smart contracts
layer, could run itself 24-7, including driving to the repair shop for
maintenance, without any human involvement.

*Example*: While DAOs are just beginning to emerge, the platform DAOstack
is working to provide these businesses with tools for success, including
reliable crypto-economic incentives and decentralized governance protocols.
DAOstack aims to create businesses where the only external influence is the
customer.

*(6) **Multiple World Models**:* We no longer live in only one place. We
have real-world personae and online personae, and this delocalized
existence is only going to expand. With the rise of Augmented Reality and
Virtual Reality, we=E2=80=99re introducing more layers to this equation. Yo=
u=E2=80=99ll
have avatars for work and avatars for play, and all of these versions of
ourselves are opportunities for new businesses.



*Example*: Second Life, the very first virtual world created in 2003, gave
rise to a multimillion-dollar economy. People were paying other people to
design digital clothes and digital houses for their digital avatars. Every
time we add a new layer to the digital strata, we=E2=80=99re also adding an=
 entire
economy built upon that layer, meaning we are now conducting our business
in multiple worlds at once. Today we have all mastered Zoom, tomorrow we=E2=
=80=99ll
be diving deep in the SpatialWeb, moving back and forth between multiple
virtual worlds and our physical reality using technologies like Vatoms and
Spatialweb.net to navigate the Metaverse.

*(7) **Transformation Economy**:* The Experience Economy was about the
sharing of experiences=E2=80=94so Starbucks went from being a coffee franch=
ise to a
=E2=80=9Cthird place.=E2=80=9D That is, neither home nor work, but a =E2=80=
=9Cthird place=E2=80=9D in which
to live your life. Buying a cup of coffee became an experience, a
caffeinated theme park of sorts. The next iteration of this idea is the
Transformation Economy, where you=E2=80=99re not just paying for an experie=
nce,
you=E2=80=99re paying to have your life transformed by this experience.

*Example*: Early versions of this model can be seen in the rise of
=E2=80=9Ctransformational festivals=E2=80=9D like Burning Man, or fitness c=
ompanies like
CrossFit, where the experience is generally bad (you work out in old
warehouses), but the transformation is great (the person you become after
three months of working out in those warehouses). Consumers are no longer
searching for merely pleasurable experiences=E2=80=94they are looking for
challenges that transform. This is also where technologies like
Spatialweb.net and Dreamscape will help to digitize, dematerialize, and
democratize such experiences everywhere on the planet.
*FINAL THOUGHTS*

What all this tells us is that business as usual is becoming *business
unusual*.

And for existing companies, as Harvard=E2=80=99s Clayton Christensen explai=
ned,
this is no longer optional: =E2=80=9CMost [organizations] think the key to =
growth
is developing new technologies and products. But often this is not so. To
unlock the next wave of growth, companies must embed these innovations in a
disruptive new business model.=E2=80=9D

And for those of us on the outside of these disruptive models, our
experience will be better, cheaper, faster.

*Better* meaning new business models do what all business models do=E2=80=
=94solve
problems for people in the real world better than anyone else.



*Cheaper* is obvious. With demonetization running rampant, customers=E2=80=
=94and
that means *all* of us=E2=80=94are expecting more for less.

But the real shift is the final shift: *faster*. New business models are no
longer forces for stability and security. To compete in today=E2=80=99s acc=
elerated
climate, these models are designed for speed and agility.

Most importantly, none of this is in any danger of slowing down.

MODELS THAT WILL RULE THE NEXT DECADE</span></strong></h2>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(1) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">The Crowd Economy</span></strong><strong>:</stron=
g> Crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, leveraged assets, and staff-on-demand=E2=80=
=94essentially, all the developments that leverage the billions of people a=
lready online and the billions <em>coming</em> online.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">All have revolutionized the way we do busines=
s. Just consider leveraged assets, like Uber=E2=80=99s vehicles and Airbnb=
=E2=80=99s rooms, which have allowed companies to <em>scale at speed</em>. =
These crowd economy models also lean on staff-on-demand, which provides a c=
ompany with the agility needed to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. =
And it=E2=80=99s everything from micro-task laborers behind Amazon=E2=80=99=
s Mechanical Turk on the low end, to Kaggle=E2=80=99s data scientist-on-dem=
and services on the high end.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: Airbnb has become t=
he largest =E2=80=9Chotel chain=E2=80=9D in the world, yet it doesn=E2=80=
=99t own a single hotel room. Instead, it leverages (that is, rents out) th=
e assets (spare bedrooms) of the crowd, with more than <em>7 million rooms,=
 flats, and houses in over 100,000 cities across the globe</em>.<strong><sp=
an style=3D"font-size:8px;color:#033568">=C2=A0<br><br></span></strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(2) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">The Free / Data Economy</span></strong><strong>:<=
/strong> This is the platform version of the =E2=80=9Cbait and hook=E2=80=
=9D model, essentially baiting the customer with free access to a cool serv=
ice and then making money off the data gathered about that customer. It als=
o includes all the developments spurred by the big data revolution, which i=
s allowing us to exploit micro-demographics <em>like never before</em>.<br>=
<br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: Facebook, Google, T=
witter=E2=80=94there=E2=80=99s a reason this model has transformed dorm roo=
m startups into global superpowers. Google=E2=80=99s search queries<em> per=
 day</em> have risen from 500,000 in 1999, to 200 million in 2004, to 3 bil=
lion in 2011, to <em>5.6 billion</em> today. While more users are becoming =
aware of the valuable data they exchange in return for Google=E2=80=99s =E2=
=80=9Cfree=E2=80=9D search service, this tried-and-true model will likely c=
ontinue to succeed in the 2020s.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(3) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">The Smartness Economy</span></strong><strong>:</s=
trong> In the late 1800s, if you wanted a good idea for a new business, all=
 you needed was to take an existing tool, say a drill or a washboard, and a=
dd electricity to it=E2=80=94thus creating a power drill or a washing machi=
ne.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">In the 2020s, <em>AI will be the electricity<=
/em>. In other words, take any existing tool, and add a layer of smartness.=
 So, cell phones became smartphones and stereo speakers became smart speake=
rs and cars become autonomous vehicles.<em>=C2=A0<br><br></em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: We all know the big=
 names incorporating AI into their business models=E2=80=94from Amazon to S=
alesforce. But more AI startups arise each day: 1,000 AI-related companies =
in the US raised over $27B in venture capital in 2020, according to Pitchbo=
ok. One of the most highly valued of those companies is Scale AI, a data-la=
beling company that supports machine learning teams, currently valued at $7=
.3B. Expect AI to continue transforming most businesses in the 2020s.<br><b=
r></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(4) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">Closed-Loop Economies</span></strong><strong>:</s=
trong> In nature, nothing is ever wasted. The detritus of one species alway=
s becomes the foundation for the survival of another species. Human attempt=
s to mimic these entirely waste-free systems have been dubbed =E2=80=9Cbiom=
imicry=E2=80=9D (if you=E2=80=99re talking about designing a new kind of pr=
oduct) or =E2=80=9Ccradle-to-cradle=E2=80=9D (if you=E2=80=99re talking abo=
ut designing a new kind of city) or, more simply, =E2=80=9Cclosed-loop econ=
omies.=E2=80=9D These models will grow increasingly prevalent with the rise=
 of environmentally-conscious consumers and the cost benefits of closed-loo=
p systems.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: The Plastic Bank, f=
ounded in 2013, allows anyone to pick up waste plastic and drop it off at a=
 =E2=80=9Cplastic bank.=E2=80=9D The collector is then paid for the =E2=80=
=9Ctrash=E2=80=9D in anything from cash to WiFi time, while the plastic ban=
k sorts the material and sells it to the appropriate recycler=E2=80=94thus =
closing an open loop in the life cycle of plastic.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(5) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</sp=
an></strong><strong>:</strong> At the convergence of blockchain and AI sits=
 a radically new kind of company=E2=80=94one with no employees, no bosses, =
and nonstop production. A set of preprogrammed rules determines how the com=
pany operates, and computers do the rest. A fleet of autonomous taxis, for =
instance, with a blockchain-backed smart contracts layer, could run itself =
24-7, including driving to the repair shop for maintenance, without any hum=
an involvement.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: While DAOs are just=
 beginning to emerge, the platform DAOstack is working to provide these bus=
inesses with tools for success, including reliable crypto-economic incentiv=
es and decentralized governance protocols. DAOstack aims to create business=
es where the only external influence is the customer.=C2=A0<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(6) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">Multiple World Models</span></strong><strong>:</s=
trong> We no longer live in only one place. We have real-world personae and=
 online personae, and this delocalized existence is only going to expand. W=
ith the rise of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, we=E2=80=99re introd=
ucing more layers to this equation. You=E2=80=99ll have avatars for work an=
d avatars for play, and all of these versions of ourselves are opportunitie=
s for new businesses.<em>=C2=A0<br><br></em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: Second Life, the ve=
ry first virtual world created in 2003, gave rise to a multimillion-dollar =
economy. People were paying other people to design digital clothes and digi=
tal houses for their digital avatars. Every time we add a new layer to the =
digital strata, we=E2=80=99re also adding an entire economy built upon that=
 layer, meaning we are now conducting our business in multiple worlds at on=
ce. Today we have all mastered Zoom, tomorrow we=E2=80=99ll be diving deep =
in the SpatialWeb, moving back and forth between multiple virtual worlds an=
d our physical reality using technologies like Vatoms and Spatialweb.net to=
 navigate the Metaverse.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>(7) </strong><strong><span style=3D"t=
ext-decoration:underline">Transformation Economy</span></strong><strong>:</=
strong> The Experience Economy was about the sharing of experiences=E2=80=
=94so Starbucks went from being a coffee franchise to a =E2=80=9Cthird plac=
e.=E2=80=9D That is, neither home nor work, but a =E2=80=9Cthird place=E2=
=80=9D in which to live your life. Buying a cup of coffee became an experie=
nce, a caffeinated theme park of sorts. The next iteration of this idea is =
the Transformation Economy, where you=E2=80=99re not just paying for an exp=
erience, you=E2=80=99re paying to have your life transformed by this experi=
ence.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><strong>Example</strong>: Early versions of t=
his model can be seen in the rise of =E2=80=9Ctransformational festivals=E2=
=80=9D like Burning Man, or fitness companies like CrossFit, where the expe=
rience is generally bad (you work out in old warehouses), but the transform=
ation is great (the person you become after three months of working out in =
those warehouses). Consumers are no longer searching for merely pleasurable=
 experiences=E2=80=94they are looking for challenges that transform. This i=
s also where technologies like Spatialweb.net and Dreamscape will help to d=
igitize, dematerialize, and democratize such experiences everywhere on the =
planet.</p>

HTS</span></strong></h2>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">What all this tells us is that business as us=
ual is becoming <em>business unusual</em>.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">And for existing companies, as Harvard=E2=80=
=99s Clayton Christensen explained, this is no longer optional: =E2=80=9CMo=
st [organizations] think the key to growth is developing new technologies a=
nd products. But often this is not so. To unlock the next wave of growth, c=
ompanies must embed these innovations in a disruptive new business model.=
=E2=80=9D<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">And for those of us on the outside of these d=
isruptive models, our experience will be better, cheaper, faster.<br><br></=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><em>Better</em> meaning new business models d=
o what all business models do=E2=80=94solve problems for people in the real=
 world better than anyone else.<em>=C2=A0<br><br></em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%"><em>Cheaper</em> is obvious. With demonetizat=
ion running rampant, customers=E2=80=94and that means <em>all</em> of us=E2=
=80=94are expecting more for less.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">But the real shift is the final shift: <em>fa=
ster</em>. New business models are no longer forces for stability and secur=
ity. To compete in today=E2=80=99s accelerated climate, these models are de=
signed for speed and agility.<br><br></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:200%">Most importantly, none of this is in any dang=
er of slowing down.<br><br></p>
