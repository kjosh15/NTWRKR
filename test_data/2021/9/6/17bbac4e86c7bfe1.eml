Michael,

Thanks for the feedback, and the articles - it was fascinating to read your
take on KPIs and the need for better feedback. All very, very much aligned
with the conversations we've been having internally over the last couple of
years.

In terms of the deck, you make some great points. We've struggled with
scoping in that a) there is a huge diversity in (inter)organizational
willingness to consider "culture" as a metrics-drive endeavor, and b) the
market has changed monthly over the last year and a half in its
appreciation of culture as a business driver per se. That said, I think
your macro suggestion particularly is spot on.

If you're willing, I'd like to set a time to introduce you to my cofounder.
He can speak more specifically to the data models and might provide a
strong next step for exploring potential collaborations. Do you have any
times available in the next couple weeks GMT?

All best,
Josh
