Chris,

I'll send an intro shortly. He could be a powerful partner, either in
analyzing KPI-led integration opportunities (see the last article
<https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-categories-to-focus-your-kpis/>
he sent) or in potentially launching a new project.

It'll be tricky juggling Sloan and Wharton, but that's not a bad problem to
have. ;)

Looking at his work of the last 3 years he's been writing numerous articles
about how orgs need something like Indigometrics. From this article
<https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rethinking-performance-management-for-=
post-pandemic-success/>
:

   - "soft skills deserve hard numbers, too"
   - "Feedback is how people get better at getting better"
   - "Better-quality feedback means better-quality outcomes."

Definitely potential here.

- J
