Jon,

Good talking to you today! I have sad news: the AI-led calendering app I
recommended was bought
<https://blog.bizzabo.com/xai-sunset?utm_campaign=3Dxai-sunset> and is bein=
g
folded into an events-management platform. I'll let you know what I dig up
as alternatives; after GPT-3's debut we're going to see many others, soon!

Let me know if I can provide any further info.

All best,
Josh
