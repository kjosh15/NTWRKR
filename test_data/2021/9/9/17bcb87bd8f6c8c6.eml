Great talking with you, as ever. Next time remind me to tell you about my
Serendipity Engine (actually just a ghetto networking systemization
platform) which is how we reconnected and hw I've replaced living in NYC
for creating networking serendipity.

In the meantime, here's a one liner on my company:

"Indigometrics uses peer-to-peer generated data to create highly
contextual, bias-adjusted models of behavior for organizations, allowing
metricing and algorithmic management of employee behavior at scale."

A short overview video is here <http://indigometrics.com>, and I've
attached our overview deck below. Let me know who I should talk to to see
about partnering.

Separately, I would love to talk about solving the climate crisis with
chatbot AIs or similar.

All best,
Josh
