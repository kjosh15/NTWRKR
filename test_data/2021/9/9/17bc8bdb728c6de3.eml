Josh,

I've been busy! Bought a house, was unemployed and actively hunting for 9
months at the beginning of the pandemic...but now I'm doing Software
Engineer-y things at Cisco (building and operating a Kubernetes thing).

I also spend a fair amount of time chasing a 2 year old parrot...I've
likened him to a flying toddler with a built in set of wire cutters.
There's actually a video of/about his freeflight training! Given your past
work with corvids, I think you might find that interesting. :)

Happy to set up a time to chat, if you'd like.

Regards,
Trede
