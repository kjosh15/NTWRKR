Awesome, this is super useful! And no worries on the delay in response;
life happens and there's a lot going on. Just let me know if you ever feel
harassed by my email followups.

I'll reach out to the companies you mentioned and will see what sort of new
players might exist. It's a fishing expedition, but it's worth trying!

In other news, I should get my glue in a week or so, so be prepared for
some sad pictures of a frankenstein'd crowbox in the near future. :)

I hope things continue to chill for you - did you ever get your floor done?

All best,
Josh
