I ran it through Google translate and ended up with a few key questions;

1. What is the interest rate, and how often/when can it change? (I ask as
this is a prime way student loan companies really penalized their
borrowers; by upping rates significantly after an initial period.)

2. Under what terms can we pay it back?

3. What is the total amount to be borrowed (monthly and annually)?

4. There was something about payback terms being pegged to income after
graduation. Is this your income, or our income?

Xoxo!
Josh
