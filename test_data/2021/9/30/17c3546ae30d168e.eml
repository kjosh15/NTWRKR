Hey, sorry, total friend fail there.

Past couple weeks have been brutal. Every day I thought "I'll get back to
Josh tonight" and then I'd fall asleep without getting around to your
email, or any other emails that have been waiting. Got overwhelmed by
variety issues.

So, I've fallen behind on camera tech and products. I have some
newest-generation Arlo stuff that I added to our home security but I don't
know much about the state of the tech or market beyond that. I know I like
the new cameras quite a lot. Great image quality and the motion detection
can be made sensitive enough to detect a wasp!

I still only know of Arlo, Ring, and Blink camera systems but of the three
have only used Arlo. REOLINK still makes individual Wi-FI motion detecting
cameras that don't require any sort of base station. I liked the Reolink
camera I used on the prototype we deployed at Cottage Lake years ago. If
they addressed some of their issues with setup (now that smartphones are so
ubiquitous) these might be really great by now. I would say they should
definitely be on your list of folks to ask about providing hardware.

Trail cameras are a good option but I'd stay with bigger-name brands that
openly advertise low latency between motion detect and camera activation-
most are proud enough to publish the actual numbers here. There are many
downmarket trail cams which have too much latency, and then conveniently
just don't publish their latency numbers. Browning has many different
models of low-latency trail cameras. I'm sure they are contract
manufactured for them but they still carry the Browning name.

Wish I knew more, could help more, and had better ideas but I just don't at
the moment.

But things have gotten less complicated for me over the past couple days so
I should be able to be a bit more present.

-Steve
