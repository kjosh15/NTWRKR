That sounds amazing! I haven't been to Yellowstone in years; that must have
been an epic adventure.

I didn't hear back on the panels I submitted, so I'm guessing if the
panelpicker is closed none of mine were selected? If so, huge bummer -
it'll be the first time in years I'll have missed out!

In terms of advisory work, that might be fun - where can I learn more?

Many thanks and all best,
Josh
