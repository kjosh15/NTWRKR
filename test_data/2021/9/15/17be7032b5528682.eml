Apologies for the long delay here and thanks for the nudge! I took a 2 week
trip exploring Glacier, Yellowstone, and the Teton parks with my wife so I
was truly offline and I am now crawling out of 300+ emails!

<<Entertainingly I've gotten several podcast/interview requests off my SXSW
talk submission!>>

That's awesome! What do you mean by where does this stand? Obviously, feel
free to accept any of those requests. And if you already have, I would love
to see some of them if they are publicly available!

In terms of helping us more.... if you have the time for it, we can discuss
a more advisory or industry evaluator role. It may be too late for 2022
(although I can check to see what's still possible) due to PanelPicker
having closed, but we do have industry folks help us review programming
ideas for our conference through the process. You can specify which
industries you have opinions on, etc, and in exchange, you can get some
perks like a badge each year.

Let me know your thoughts back! Hope you have been well!!

anelPicker having closed, but we do have industry folks help us review prog=
