I recently figured out how to get Shazam to autoread all those old MP3s I
ripped of mixtapes from high school and dump them into Spotify playlists.
One of my favorites was one you made for me (or that I stole from you,
maybe?) Either way, here you go:

Side A
<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6y4S0y9fEN8XMCQ41Sk6e4?si=3D6d0f7ad8712b=
4325>
Side B
<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cfOnjdFlUIqJRq6QjAmBx?si=3D202d47db2221=
4d0d>

Hit me with an update in reply if you have a moment. It's been some long,
strange years...!
