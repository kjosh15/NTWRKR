So now that I have staff one of my employees is taking the random articles
pursuant to Indigometrics that I find on the internet and is posting them
on LinkedIn. For the first time, I actually have a content stream.

Do you have time to briefly catch up in the next couple weeks to advise me
on HTF to maximize returns from this new resource? I honestly don't know
anyone better qualified!!

I hope you and yours are well,
Josh
