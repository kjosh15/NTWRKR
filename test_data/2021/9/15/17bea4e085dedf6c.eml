It was quite the epic adventure!

Panelpicker is closed for review and that will be ongoing for several more
weeks so you are not out of it! I am expecting the various folks to make
selections and send notification emails starting in 2-3 weeks.

Let me chat with my colleague on if this season is too late and get back to
you. If it is, that process for the next season begins after March 2022.
