If you asked anyone in our family but me, they are likely to say it is just=
 fine.
Meanwhile, the circle of covid is getting smaller and smaller.
For a long time we didn't know anyone personally who had contracted covid. =
Now we know people who have been hospitalized and some who have died.=C2=A0
We just got back from a vacation in CO where we went to RMNP, Pike's peak, =
a few other natural wonders. It was a good trip.=C2=A0
I am a different person, Josh. I am not as happy. Humans disappoint me, par=
ticularly Americans. I had NO IDEA so many otherwise smart=C2=A0 Americans =
could be so gullible.=C2=A0
We are burning down in the west and flooding in the east. New Orleans shoul=
d just call it a night and head home....
Ha! I know this comes across as extremely negative. Just having a few bad d=
ays. It feels like the ignorance is closing in on me.=C2=A0 =F0=9F=98=AB
Good for Hulda! I wish I could take some programming/IT classes, but the co=
st is just too much in a time where I want to travel more while also save f=
or retirement.=C2=A0
I am in the office 5 days a week and Will JUST started going back one day a=
 week about 6 weeks ago. He has been at home alone for 18 months and it is =
starting to show! =F0=9F=A4=A3 He talks to the dogs A LOT. LOL
I have a friend in Iceland right now. A solo trip. He is posting lots of be=
autiful pictures. It is a beautiful country.
The farmhouse sounds cool. Send some pics when you get a chance.=C2=A0
Overall, life is good. I am complaining here, but don't really have the rig=
ht to....
Be well and stay healthy. Hug everyone for us.=C2=A0
