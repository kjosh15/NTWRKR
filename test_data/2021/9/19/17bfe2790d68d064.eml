Essentially a suite of tests that allow parents to choose from a variety of 
donor embryos to ensure there are no defects. That's the harshest phrasing 
I can come up with, but as a parent I think it's due - and certainly echoes 
the critics. 

At the same time, the process was safe, effective, and a natural next step 
to in-vitro. Worth noting and considering as we look at widening 
income/access gaps globally.
