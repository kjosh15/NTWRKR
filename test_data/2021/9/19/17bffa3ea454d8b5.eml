I=E2=80=99m writing first to thank you for information that may have saved =
my life;
early on in using 23&Me I=E2=80=99d seen that I was prone to diabetes. But =
given
that I exercise regularly, keep a very low body fat, and eat extremely
healthily I scoffed at the idea that I was at risk.

Then I subscribed to your service and read that you advised a very low carb
diet - *extremely* low. As in ketogenis low; 8% of my daily calories. That
made me take notice; it was so weird!

Earlier this year I got a continuous glucose monitor and noticed my blood
sugar levels were high. A blood test confirmed that I was pre-diabetic.
After coming back to your report I read that I have four alleles that make
me either prone to diabetes, likely to have low levels of insulin, or
carbohydrate sensitive. Taken together, it suddenly made sense how someone
with my lifestyle, body type, and diet could be prediabetic.

As a result I=E2=80=99m now able make *much* smarter choices about how to h=
andle my
diagnosis. Which brings me to my next question:

The report you gave me indicated that I had:

ACE ID *
PPARG CC **
TCF7L2 CT *
ADRB2 AG *

Can you help me understand this in more detail? Specifically, what studies
this recommendation is drawn from and how to make more detailed choices
about diet going forward? (I.e., are saturated fats likely a problem vs.
just eating low carb, etc.)

Many, many thanks,
Josh
