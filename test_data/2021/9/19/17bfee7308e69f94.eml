Glad things are (mostly) normal(ish). These days that feels like an
achievement!

We=E2=80=99re still enjoying an extended summer; Icelanders have long said =
they
have high hopes for global warming but this year it seems to have come true=
.

In terms of dead of winter, it mostly involves me pulling them on sleds
through snowdrifts to where the monster truck picks them up to drive them
to school, then running outside to snowshoe/ski around during the one hour
of dusky daylight. Otherwise it=E2=80=99s a lot of time by the fireplace / =
on
computers. My inner 12 y.o. is delighted, and my current self has built a
gym in the barn to combat the relentless tide of baked goods.

Come visit sometime!
- J
