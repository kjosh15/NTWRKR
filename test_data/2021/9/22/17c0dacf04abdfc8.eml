As per your advice I went back to this
<https://feinternational.com/blog/saas-metrics-value-saas-business/>
article and am predicting a 5x multiple for valuation, based on:

Age: We're 5 years in now
Time: 35/week (that's optimistic, but in any case clearly not a part-time
venture)
Trends: Our segment is very, very hot right now
Churn: We've only ever lost one customer, and they weren't paying.

That's very positive in 3 of 4 metrics. At that rate if we clear $.5mm this
year we can value ourselves at $2.5mm. Not the scaled sell candidate we
want to be, but definitely a different conversation in terms of stock
dilution.

Curious what you made of the article and what you think of my logic!

Love,
Josh

P.S. I'm suspicious the $750k valuation that Chris sent is the actual
revenue this year, in which case our estimated value is even higher. I'm
waiting for confirmation on this now!
