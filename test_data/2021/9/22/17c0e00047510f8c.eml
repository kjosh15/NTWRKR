Hello Joshua,

Thank you for your reply. As an early adopter of 23andMe, you were genoty=
ped on a previous version of our chip and don=E2=80=99t have access to al=

t recent version of our chip - V5 - to receive the latest Health + Ancest=
ry Service experience. By purchasing a chip upgrade, you will receive a n=
ew kit at a discounted rate $125. Your Chip Upgrade will be associated wi=
th your profile, but the 14-digit barcode must be registered to your acco=
unt once you receive your Chip Upgrade kit.

Specifically, you do not have access to our newly released reports includ=
ing Chronic Kidney Disease (APOL1-Related), Type 2 Diabetes (Powered by 2=
3andMe research)*, Familial Hypercholesterolemia*, Bunions, Flat Feet, an=
d more. To see a full list of what reports you=E2=80=99d receive from a c=

*The 23andMe PGS test includes health predisposition and carrier status r=
eports. Health predisposition reports include both reports that meet FDA =
requirements for genetic health risks and the 23andMe Type 2 Diabetes hea=
lth predisposition report which is based on 23andMe research and has not =
been reviewed by the FDA. The test uses qualitative genotyping to detect =
select clinically relevant variants in the genomic DNA of adults from sal=
iva for the purpose of reporting and interpreting genetic health risks an=
d reporting carrier status. It is not intended to diagnose any disease. Y=
our ethnicity may affect the relevance of each report and how your geneti=
c health risk results are interpreted. Each genetic health risk report de=
scribes if a person has variants associated with a higher risk of develop=
ing a disease, but does not describe a person=E2=80=99s overall risk of d=
eveloping the disease. The test is not intended to tell you anything abou=
t your current state of health, or to be used to make medical decisions, =
including whether or not you should take a medication, how much of a medi=
cation you should take, or determine any treatment. Our carrier status re=
ports can be used to determine carrier status, but cannot determine if yo=
u have two copies of any genetic variant. These carrier reports are not i=
ntended to tell you anything about your risk for developing a disease in =
the future, the health of your fetus, or your newborn child's risk of dev=
eloping a particular disease later in life. For certain conditions, we pr=
ovide a single report that includes information on both carrier status an=
d genetic health risk. Warnings & Limitations: The 23andMe PGS Genetic He=
alth Risk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) is indicated for rep=
orting of the 185delAG and 5382insC variants in the BRCA1 gene and the 61=
74delT variant in the BRCA2 gene. The report describes if a woman is at i=
ncreased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and if a man is at=
 increased risk of developing breast cancer or may be at increased risk o=
f developing prostate cancer. The three variants included in this report =
are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and do not represen=
t the majority of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in the general population. The MUT=
YH-Associated Polyposis Genetic Health Risk Report is indicated for repor=
ting the Y179C and G396D variants in the MUTYH gene and an increased risk=
 for colorectal cancer. The two variants included in this report are most=
 common in people of Northern European descent. These reports do not incl=
ude variants in other genes linked to hereditary cancers and the absence =
of variants included in these reports do not rule out the presence of oth=
er genetic variants that may impact cancer risk. The PGS test is not a su=
bstitute for visits to a healthcare professional for recommended screenin=
gs or appropriate follow-up. Results should be confirmed in a clinical se=
tting before taking any medical action. For important information and lim=
itations regarding other genetic health risk reports and carrier status r=
eports, visit https://www.23andme.com/test-info.

Hello Joshua,

Thank you for contacting the 23andMe Team. The Type 2 Diabetes report doe=
s not provide information about type 1 diabetes or other forms of diabete=
s, such as MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) and gestational di=
abetes. In addition, scientists do not yet know whether the genetic varia=
nts included in this report are relevant for people who have already been=
 diagnosed with type 1 diabetes or other forms of diabetes. However, main=
taining a healthy weight and lifestyle are important for your overall hea=
lth if you have type 1 diabetes. Talk to a healthcare professional if you=
 have any concerns about your diabetes symptoms or management.
