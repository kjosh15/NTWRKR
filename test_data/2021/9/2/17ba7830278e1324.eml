No, I was looking for this:

https://honemaxwell.sharefile.com/r-rc07a4aa9f9754f1ca1a1c26551fed458

Except it isn't working now. Is there a new link I should be using?

Thanks for the link you sent, however I don't have W-4s and am entirely
self employed - how can I calculate estimated payments accordingly, and how
do I alter those as/if my income changes?

Finally, I do not live in NYC (I live in Iceland). As per my notes for 2020
we left the US on June 14th, 2020. I have an LLC which I domesticated to
Wyoming (filed as of 3/30/21 and backdated to the formation of the company)
and which receives all my business income. A couple questions as a result:

1) How does this affect my estimated payments?

2) Does this affect my 2020 tax filing?

Thanks!
Josh
