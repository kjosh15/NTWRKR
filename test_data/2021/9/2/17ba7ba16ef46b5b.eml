Hi Josh - Thanks for reaching out. I know you had worked with Geoffrey
years ago on a project for CR. Unfortunately, there aren't any upcoming
projects that we would need your support for. I'll definitely reach out
though if anything comes up!

Thank you,
Liz

Wanted to followup to see if there was reason to reconnect. I'm curious to
hear what you're up to and to see if we can't innovate on something world
changing together!!

All best,
Josh

Below are a few of my current projects; let me know if any strike your
interest, or just hit me with an update on what you're working on. Or let's
set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,

as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology

changes in the last year - the winners are acting on it!
