Thanks, Mike - the conversation was a pleasure, and I look forward
to reading the links you sent! As you noted, it's refreshing to be able to
speak clearly about this domain, and as ever your insights were extremely
salient.

I'm attaching our general deck, and of course we have an overview video on
our site <http://www.indigometrics.com>. Let me know what more I can tell
you and/or if you think it's worth speaking again soon about comparing
notes, the potential for contributing to a publication, or potential
projects. As mentioned, we're keen to work with experts who can push our
thinking ahead of our customers. As per Ford's quote about customers only
wanting faster horses, we think there's a lot more here.

All the best,
Josh
