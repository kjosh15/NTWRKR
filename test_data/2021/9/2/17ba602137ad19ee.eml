I met Mike (see his links below) at an event in Madrid some years ago; he's
very much an "MIT Business School Expert" and has focused on collaboration
for some time, meaning he has a very good handle on the (academic and
consulting) side of the industry.

He was very taken with our platform and wanted to continue the discussion;
given our relationship with Wharton I don't want to push too hard, but
thought it might be worth your talking with him to get his take on our data
and directions we could take it. If nothing else, he could be a potential
inroad to additional corporate clients, as he has and has access to many.
Let me know if you're interested; otherwise I'm going to send him our
public materials and will schedule a followup call in a few months to keep
the connection going.

All best,
Josh
