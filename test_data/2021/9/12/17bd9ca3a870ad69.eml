Wanted to get your opinion before I spammed a bunch of companies. I'd
thought to get a big list of companies making Alro-style cameras and ask
them if they wanted to sponsor cameras for Crowbox projects people are
building out there.

But when I looked, I saw a ton of new home-security style cameras, and a
huge list of existing trail cams.

I'm assuming trail cams are better suited, but I don't know much about how
either is marketed and can't get a read (based on my 5m of looking!) on
which might respond better to a pitch. You've been watching this space a
lot longer; do you have any tips on where to begin making this list?

Put another way, I don't want to compile a huge list of home security Ring
style cameras only to have wasted my time.

Hope you're doing well and are actually getting that floor done!
