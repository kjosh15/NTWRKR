 Aging well requires strong leg muscles
 creativity is totally required
 must avoid dementia

new neurons are born are in the hippocampus
the hippocampus is around PLACE
so you need emotionally charged experiences outside in novel environments
to make new neurons

fast twitch needs to be trained a couple times a week or you lose it

all of again in inflammation
he thinks marajuinna is the best long term solution for this

to age well you must train like a pro athlete
must also choose a sport with high flow

Read: the blue zone
also you MUST READ: The Creative Age AND read The Mature Mind

He does recovery work every single day
includes 20m of reading widely
20 of breathwork

after 60 your two hemispheres actualy start communicating way much more
BUT you have to train against risk aversion
