Marketing:
 What I=E2=80=99m beginning now
 Involves articles, podcasts, interviews, speaking, social media posts
 Requires outreach on all of the same (except social)
 Uses my network mostly to increase exposure
 Needs to be focused on platforms, messages, outlets, and targets we want

Sales:
 Needs a clearer process
 Needs to solve why not closing
 Experimenting with new models / offerings
 Focused on: L&D, Consultancies, asset firms
 Trying to validate regulatory options (ISQM)
 Trying to validate reseller arrangement

Rest of strategy is around securing/stabilizing back end, systematizing
onboarding and support, and optimizing the company for M&A + IP moat
through our analytics and data.
