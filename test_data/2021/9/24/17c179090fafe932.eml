Heinrich,

Thanks so much for an insightful call yesterday; you hit most of my
high-level questions and left me hungry for more, which is definitely a
good sign!

As discussed, I'll do a little digging to confirm that I can deliver value
here as well as to give me a better idea of the potential that I and some
of my peers see for Bekaert. Are you available to speak late morning GMT on
Oct 4 or 5? Let me know if you have any further questions I can answer in
the meantime.

All best,
Josh

<div>Dear Josh &amp; Heinrich,

<div>The main reason for connecting you is that one of our plans to help Be=
