Let me know if you have any feedback on this; otherwise I'll just spam
whatever emails I can readily find and see what comes. I hope all is well
on your end!

Otherwise I'm still waiting for the glue so I can repair my box. The local
ravens are def. interested in additional food sources so I thikn we'll have
a good audience...

All best,
Josh
