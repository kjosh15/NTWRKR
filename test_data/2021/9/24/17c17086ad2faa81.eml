*TL;DR: I'm having all the right conversations, but everything is happening
at 1/2 speed - it's like the summer slump never ended. Is this a Covid
phenomena, or am I missing the mark?*

All through the summer I consoled myself about our lack of new sales with
the idea that the summer + Covid meant a freeze on everything. But we're
firmly on the other side of summer now, and while I'm still getting the
right calls on the books (right partners, right potential clients, right
people within the organization, etc.) everything is being pushed out two
weeks, nearly continuously.

Part of this is because we're targeting large multinationals. As we
continue to vet the platform with experts of all types it's becoming
increasingly clear that our data (especially as it scales) is going to
become enormously valuable, so larger data sets are a clear goal... But the
sales cycle is glacially slow.

But it's also happening with potential partners, like Blackrock and KPMG.
My concern is that we're over-emphasizing large targets and possible
acquirers instead of exploring mid-size customers, especially now that our
backend is more stable and able to handle scaled onboarding.

If you have an opinion on how to prioritize targets in the current
environment I'd love to hear it; there is no "right" answer, but as we
accelerate into fall I feel the need to narrow our focus - be it to lightly
explore more targets, or deeply emphasize fewer.

All best,
Josh

P.S. What are you up to these days? I've really appreciated your help and
am always keen to return the favor!
