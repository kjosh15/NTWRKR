Hey Josh: I'd be shocked if you even remember who I am=E2=80=94you're usual=
ly
working on *really* cool stuff comparatively, so I'm honored to be on your
outreach here.

As a refresher about eight years ago, I walked into your office after
Nicolae Rusan introduced us, and you were ultra-busy=E2=80=94I was just loo=
king to
network in the city. Being the cool dude that you are, you dropped
everything and we went for a ramen lunch.

We've reconnected once since then, when Nicolae held a breakfast at
Mogador=E2=80=94we sat next to one another and you told me you were helping=
 execs
with their innovation and big-picture thinking.

I'm still running my little business (MailCharts
<https://www.mailcharts.com>), and have since moved up to the woods of
Vermont. Not sure if any of that fits the bill, but if you are indeed
looking to connect=E2=80=94I'd of course drop everything to say 'Hi!'.

And, if not, no worries at all.

Hope all is well,

Tom Buchok
