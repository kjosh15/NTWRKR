Steven,

Let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> suit for a
followup call on the Serendipity Project (which was an outstanding success,
netting me ~3 large customers + 2 insight calls/week + ~40% open rates from
~5k people in terms of exposure).

I'd also like to get your take on the "happiest" athletes; I want to know
what sports net the best long-term physical/psychological
happiness/comfort. Recently saw the injury rates for runners and painkiller
usage for weightlifters: fuck that.
