Annalisa,

Wanted to offer to reconnect now that you've been in your new role for a
bit. I haven't got anything strategic to offer - in fact, I wanted to get
your take on what sub-boards you think I'd be best suited for - so feel
free to decline if actual business prevails!

That said, if it'd be useful/refreshing to catch up I always enjoy your
perspective.

All best,
Josh
