Probably. Though to be honest, I don't completely understand them. I fear
I'm so far from corporate culture that what you're saying to me is like
telling me about some new changes in Nigerian parliament rules.

But I want to learn. I'm behind on two stories I've already done the
reporting for and a couple more I promised. And I know that journalism
itself is a bit of a financial time suck. These are my excuses. But I'll
wrap my head around this when I finish these two stories.

Though I did hear a podcast (or was it a story I read) about corporate
surveillance of employees skyrocketing since Covid so I feel like there's
some ambient heat on what you guys are doing, no?
