You should have received a label you can print and tape to the front of the
box (make sure it's covered in clear packing tape - available at the FedEx
office - so it doesn't get torn in transit) and drop it off to the clerk.
Can you confirm?

Really really appreciate it - thanks, Sharon!!!

xoxo,
Josh
