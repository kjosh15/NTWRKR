Sounds like the making of an MIT Business School project and/or an
article... or, best case, a new customer (if he can bring one.) I'm not
that interested if it entails a lot of development effort on our end
(creating our own stack overflow sounds like a shit way to burn a ton of
hours) but if he has a client to bring to it a new project could be
worthwhile. What's your appetite?
