1. One of our early (but smaller) companies sparked a big discussion around
their values when they discovered that one of them, "congeniality," was
poorly understood throughout the company. I.e., getting actual data on your
values forces you to determine if your values are what you think they are
(or should be.) Might be able to get actual direct quotes for this one.

Idea is that measurement of soft skills / values forces everyone to be
explicit with each other about them.

2. A recent (and large) customer discovered that they really need to have
employee alignment to have customer alignment (reg. values); they're
constantly asking to discuss the exact wording of their behavior
statements. We're asking them to start a steering committee and providing
data for same.

Idea is that we can demonstrate how an ongoing conversation about values,
backed by data, can create intentional cultural evolution.

3. An OpEd on  our platform as a more positive step towards actual wokeness
- i.e., we know employees are more willing to accept feedback about their
behavior if it's provided by machines, and we know wokeness is becoming a
major cultural export as well as a movement. Can the two together provoke
more positive change when backed by intentional alignment to stated values?

Let me know if you think any of the above are worth discussing!

All best,
Josh
