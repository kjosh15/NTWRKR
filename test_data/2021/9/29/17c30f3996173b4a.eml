Susan,

Thanks again for the conversation yesterday; abbreviated as it was, I think
it served its purpose in making me, at least, hungry for more! Really
looking forward to the panel this Friday.

I've included some notes on a potential framing with a few examples that I
can use if it suits you. My goal here is to situate the employee/employer
shift as a focal point for the evolution in AI + Big Data and to provide a
few examples listeners may not have heard of to illustrate.

Personally I always shoot to have at least 2-3 "water cooler" examples
people can take away from the talk that summarize the gist, so I aimed for
some quick ones within the below. I did a quick runthrough in ~5m, so
hopefully that leaves room for questions and deluge with the other
panelists.

Let me know if you have any comments, advice, or suggestions, and otherwise
I'll see you Friday!

All best,
Josh



1. The employer / employee power balance has massively shifted

   - Great resignation at same time as Great Hiring Draught

2. At the same time, technological capacity has exploded... for employers
and employees alike

   - Boom in spyware led to a boom in business for us as it created churn
   early in the pandemic

3. This is creating an arms race between employees and employers

   - Ex: Employees buying "zoom loops" (1)
   - Ex: Ozy deepfake non-scandal (2)

4. The winners have realized that, just as we had a huge shift towards
Customer Experience, we now need Employee Experience

   - Ex: WSJ article; employees crave data about themselves... when it's
   evaluated by machines. (3)

5. Providing this data in a values-led way delivers massive value,
insulates against risk, and ensures agility. The alternative is to be
*reactive*, and use the technology as it appears

   - Ex: RFID Bathroom monitoring
   - Ex: Amazon's shocking wrist monitors for warehouse employees (4)
