Hey, look, my head did NOT explode!! ;)

I have a demo with Lululemon at 4pm that day that's been on the books for a
couple months, so I'd rather not move it. More pressingly, the boys (and
you) have haircuts scheduled at 5pm.

Some potential options;

1. I take them out of school early and drop them off an Ingunn's, then do
my demo from downstairs.
2. The boys have a playdate and we reschedule the haircuts,
3. Avi picks them up and takes them to meet you for the haircuts.

Any other ideas?

xoxo,
Josh
