Suggest stock/salary split to xmas

Then we should reevaluate BOTH
A) salary strategy going forward, and
B) valuation of the company (as it is profitable now, hopefully aiming at a
sale, and has value relative to both of those vs whatever the # is now.

Ask how we got to valuation we=E2=80=99re currently using

Bone up on PE ratios to get value of company
=E2=80=9C=E2=80=9D on other ways to validate company

Big idea: if nobody is putting $$ in, increase my equity! If we DO need
more cash, re-evaluate corporate value so it is much higher=E2=80=A6 meanin=
g less
dilution for the cash influx.
