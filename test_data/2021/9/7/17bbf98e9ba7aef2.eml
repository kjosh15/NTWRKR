I recently co-hosted the NY Times + Accenture's big new business podcast, B=
uilt
for Change <https://accntu.re/3ttSJek> (now #8 in Apple's Management
category.) In the process I've learned a ton about business podcasts, and
the field is exploding in popularity!

I know American Express has dabbled in podcasting, which is a great sign,
but I think it could more expressly nail the narrative and content that
would help it reach larger audiences and play a more strategic marketing
role. Do you know if this is a conversation anyone internally would be up
for having?

All best wishes,
Josh
