Joshua,

Below is this morning=E2=80=99s speed. This is from my iPad while sitting i=
n our bedroom upstairs. There is no second result because I am using the As=
us mesh router in lieu of the included (very basic) Starlink router. Pings =
are generally 30 to 50 ms (as opposed to our HughesNet internet at an avera=
ge 1120 ms).=20

The other screen grab shows the mesh AP in the Art Studio. The router is cu=
rrently in the living room, next to the tv. Signal goes across the room, th=
rough the wall into the bathroom, through the tiled wall of the shower, out=
side across 120 feet (37 meters) and into the Art Studio to the access poin=
t. Note it says the signal is weak, yet there are 2 Echo dots connected to =
the =E2=80=98Net via this AP that are functioning. This mesh network is a d=
ual-band rather than a tri-band system. This means there is no dedicated th=
ird 5 Gb band dedicated to connecting to the main router for backhaul. Inst=
ead, I will buy a 250 ft outdoor cat 6 Ethernet cable and connect the AP di=
rectly to the router. This will, a- get us a full-strength signal and, b- g=
ive us faster speed internally (on the intranet) for backing up, exchanging=
 files, et cetera. I have checked signal strength with an app on my phone a=
nd it looks like I should have =E2=80=98Net and phone access from the mailb=
ox to the creek.=20

Now to relocate the Starlink antenna to the roof and see if we reduce obstr=
uction time significantly. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently showing=
 35 to 40 minutes of obstruction, 2 minutes of no signal and 12 seconds of =
=E2=80=9Cnetwork issue=E2=80=9D (this can be pushed updates from Starlink) =
every 24 hours. I=E2=80=99ll keep you posted as to changes.=20

Love,
DAD
