As for how Bitchoin mining works, it's only difficult to grasp because it's
so stupid. Essentially, the miner must verify 1MB of transactions (which is
useful as it means lots of people are making sure that what's going onto
the chain is true). Then they must guess a large number by running a
computationally expensive math problem in the hopes that they're the first
to guess the answer. If they do, they get a bitcoin. (I told it you it was
stupid.)

The benefit to this is it disincentivizes miners from entering fraudulent
transactions onto the chain, and incentivises people to do the work of
validating transactions, thus keeping the process running.

There's a decent short video here
<https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/>, and a
slightly more in-depth explanation in text here
<https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work-5088328>. If you
grok that next check out proof of stake, which is Etherium's approach to
the same thing but without burning electricity at quite such a rate to do
it.
