Wanted to followup to see if there was reason to reconnect. I'm curious to =

All best,
Josh

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf);=
 a data analytics platform for autonomously measuring and managing employee=
 behavior. If your distributed workforce is starting to fray or you're =
looking for a data-led D&I solution, this is the answer. =20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Innovation Consulting(http://www.josh.is): as ever, I continue to work with=
 senior leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / =
