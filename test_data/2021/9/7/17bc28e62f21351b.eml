Hey Josh!

Somehow our meeting last week didn=E2=80=99t get on my calendar and I =
totally spaced it, sorry about that lack of awareness. I just =
rescheduled for tomorrow. Here=E2=80=99s a more fleshed out version of =
what I was hinting at with my email to you and Keith.

=F0=9F=98=98
=E2=80=94Rafe

Truth Market Platform Cooperative

INTRODUCTION

Based on my research as of August 31, 2021, I would like to bet on the =
following claim:

Taking an appropriately dosed course of Ivermectin prevents COVID-19 =
cases at least 75% better than not taking it.

I know a number of people who think I am foolish and who would be happy =
to take my money. Perhaps you are one of them?

The trouble is, there currently does not exist a mutually acceptable =
method to arbitrate this bet. This, despite the fact that there are =
dozens of studies, including several randomized control trials and =
meta-analyses on the subject. As a society we should be able to do =
better than an intellectual stalemate and pissing match for matters of =
importance to many people.

My aim with this paper is to advocate for (and recruit people to help =
build) a system of truth seeking that involves objective measurement of =
credibility, and betting on truth claims.

My ultimate vision is for Truth Markets to be a place where claimants =
=E2=80=94 scientists, journalists and others who are dedicated to the =
investigation of truth =E2=80=94 have a platform to make money by =
earning dividends directly proportional to the market value of the Truth =
Claims (TCs) they issue to the marketplace. And to allow anyone to put =
their money where their beliefs are.

WHY DO WE NEED TRUTH MARKETS?

I believe that the existing institutions of science and journalism have =
been corrupted by perverse incentives and institutional capture, and =
thus no longer function as well as they could and need to in today=E2=80=99=
s world.

I also believe that the complexities of modern society have brought us =
to the limits of individual human rationality. Moreover, the potential =
for better collective rationality is not being leveraged. In other =
words, dysfunction and corruption are not the only reasons for the =
current truth predicament. Indeed, there are known methodologies and =
technologies for improving collective sensemaking which are being =
employed by the military and large private institutions, which are not =
being employed in the public sector.

Truth Markets is an attempt to correct both of these failings by =
leveraging proven collective intelligence practices and creating =
properly aligned financial incentives for all participants in the =
system.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUTH AND PREDICTION

Any truth claim can be framed in terms of a prediction.

For example, I could easily have written the Ivermectin truth claim =
above as follows:

It will be proven by date XYZ that taking an appropriately dosed course =
of Ivermectin prevents COVID-19 cases at least 75% better than not =
taking it.

This may seem like trivial semantics, but it unlocks two important and =
practical considerations for our purposes:

Changing the focus from a quasi-religious debate (what is truth anyway?) =
to a proof process that can be agreed upon in advance.=20
Allowing us to leverage the well-demonstrated power of forecasting tools =
like predictions markets and =E2=80=9Csuperforecasting=E2=80=9D.

SUPERFORECASTING

The Good Judgment Project (see here =
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster>, here =
<https://fs.blog/2015/12/ten-commandments-for-superforecasters/>, here =
<https://smile.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlo=
ck/dp/0804136718> and here <https://goodjudgment.com/about/>) has =
demonstrated the following w.r.t. predictions about the future:
There exist individual non-expert =E2=80=9Csuperforecasters=E2=80=9D who =
can consistently and significantly outperform experts, prediction =
markets and AI.
The skills that superforecasters exhibit are known and can be learned; =
anyone with enough incentive can dramatically improve their prediction =
ability.

The Good Judgment Project shows that superforecasters have a superior =
way of modeling the world and reducing various human biases, and they =
use these these skills to make good predictions. In fact =
superforecasters beat professional intelligence agencies in forecasting =
competitions by a whopping 30%, despite not having access to the =
classified information used by those agencies. Superforecasters as a =
group have never lost a prediction competition in the several decades =
that they have been competing.

Since forecasting the future and understanding the current reality both =
require having accurate models of the world and removing bias, it stands =
to reason that superforecasters would be much better than scientists or =
journalists at evaluating truth claims.

It=E2=80=99s important to note that superforecasters are called such =
because they have empirically validated track records, well beyond =
statistical significance, and beyond that of experts with deep domain =
knowledge and privileged information.=20

We do need experts, and they tend to make excellent scientists and =
journalists. Yet the skills it takes to do a good job in these =
professions seem to run counter to the skills it takes to evaluate the =
truth of their claims in the broader context. That=E2=80=99s where =
empirically validated forecasters  come in.

PROOF OF TRUTH PROTOCOL

Given a sufficient population of people we can trust to be objective =
arbiters of truth, then we can construct a system in which to evaluate =
truth claims of all sorts. Moreover, this system can be designed not =
only to be free of perverse incentives, but also to be anti-fragile. =
Meaning that the more money is spent trying to manipulate the markets, =
the more accurate and robust they become.

Adjudication via decentralized blockchain oracles
Every participant in the system has a reputation score R, which is =
dynamically updated based on their actions. The higher your R, the more =
frequently you will be chosen to judge the truth of claims. When =
selected, here=E2=80=99s what happens:
Your status as a judge will be kept secret until after you make your =
judgment
You will have a random amount of time (from days to weeks) to do your =
research and render your judgment
Once you lock in your judgment you will be paid a =E2=80=9Cmining =
reward=E2=80=9D
Once the claim has been fully adjudicated, your R score is updated based =
on how far your judgment is from the median.

Betting on adjudication events
Anyone can bet on the outcome of adjudication events. Once a judgment =
has been rendered, all bets are paid out, and R scores are updated. A =
commission (called the =E2=80=9Cvig=E2=80=9D) is taken to pay the mining =
rewards and other system-wide incentives.

Unlike normal financial markets (including standard prediction markets), =
realtime information on the status of an active claim is kept secret =
until the adjudication happens and bets are cleared. This is to dampen =
the speculative bubble phenomenon wherein public sentiment (in the form =
of market price) subconsciously effects a judge=E2=80=99s perception of =
the truth value of the claim. To further dampen feedback loops, the =
judgment mining rewards will be inversely correlated with the length of =
time it takes you to render your judgment. However however your R score =
is directly  correlated. This dynamic tension forces you to take the =
proper amount of time to research the claim but not to delay once =
you=E2=80=99ve done so.

Making a truth claim
If you have a high enough R you may make a truth claim for free. =
Otherwise you must pay a sliding scale fee. Either way, if your claim is =
judged to be true you earn a dividend that would make it profitable even =
for a beginner who has to pay the full fee.

Recruiting and betting on truth-tellers
To incentivize platform growth and encourage superforecasters to join, =
any member may sponsor a non-member by betting on them. The new member =
gets an immediate referral bonus from the sponsor=E2=80=99s bet, and the =
sponsor earns dividends based on the new member=E2=80=99s performance on =
the platform.

Transparent scoring and pseudonymous identities
The entire history of claims, bets and judgments, as well as the =
calculation of R values are stored on the blockchain and linked to =
pseudonymous accounts.=20

Pseudonymous accounts earn R at a slower rate than verified identities, =
but we allow for pseudonyms to encourage people who have career risk to =
to join the platform.

Incentive mechanisms will be put in place to make it unprofitable to =
create multiple accounts or bogus accounts.

Cooperative dividends
A portion of the betting vig will go to pay out regular dividends to all =
members of the platform proportional to their R score.=
