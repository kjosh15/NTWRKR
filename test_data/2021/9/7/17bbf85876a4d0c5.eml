Chris is a former banker specializing in credit modeling. He's built and
sold startups in the past and is extremely numerate.

No agenda beyond his getting a better understanding of your current work
focus so we can all determine where/how we might want to collaborate. In
the meantime, please do send over any drafts you think might work, and feel
free to suggest times that work for you on your return to the east coast.

All best,
Josh
