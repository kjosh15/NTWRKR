Hey Josh!

First, sorry it's taking me awhile to reply, I have been MIA with pain and =
depression.

Secondly, I am glad to hear from your mom how well you and your family are =
doing.  Please tell Holda(sp?) and boys good luck with school.

Thirdly, thank you for thinking about me.  I told your mom I was a little c=
onfused with first email.  Please know if I DID have money to invest, it wo=
uld be with you and your company.

So, that all be said, I was thinking about the diabetes. (And pain and depr=
ession that I need to track) Does your company work with apps at all?  I ha=
ve tried to find a good tracking app for health, but there just isn't any t=
hat can to do what I need.  I would be able to pay a small fee for a tracki=
ng app I can share with my doctor.

I am so glad your parents moved next door.  I adore my friendship with your=
 mom.  She knows my pain and depression can be overwhelming, and still spen=
ds time visiting me!  I am very lucky to call her friend.  You have great p=
arents.  And I hope you and Devon both know we are here for anything they n=
eed help with and always keep an eye out for them.

With the way our country is going, although you guys are far away, I am gla=
d you guys are in Iceland.  It broke your mom's heart when you first moved,=
 but like me is now very glad you guys are in a safe place.

Yes, it would be nice to chat with you.  Mornings are tough for me, so it's=
 best to call between noon and 2pm.

Take care of your self and that special little family.  You guys are in my =
prayers.

Wendi
