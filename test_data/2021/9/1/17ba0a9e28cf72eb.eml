Oh man, would love to see that!!! How's Spain been?

Thanks so much for the recruiter connection; my friend has built up one of
the biggest, most successful *corporate leader" network in the world. Not
sure how that parallels, but it's certainly an interesting skill set and
rolodex. I.e., maybe not CEO, but certainly beneficial at some level of the
org? We'll see what your recruiter friend says.

Travel well,
Josh
