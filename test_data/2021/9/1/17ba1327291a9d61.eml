Thanks Josh. Hugely helpful. I do not have experience in that kind of NGO.
I do have community organization experience, just very local. I have
founded and chaired a civics nonprofit aimed at driving voter engagement,
rooting out (very real and very systemic) local corruption, and ending
local disenfranchisement. Slightly more metaphorically, I have built
communities for a decade and a half. It's a language I speak quite well. I
would be an unorthodox candidate but isn't orthodox thinking what gets
people into problems in the first place? :)

I will reach out to Sarah per above and please express my gratitude to
Nuria for both the name and the insight. APPRECIATE IT!
