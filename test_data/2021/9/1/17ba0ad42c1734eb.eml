Phillip,

My friend gave me the name of a recruiter you should talk to
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahroth1/>- tell her Nuria Ruiz passed her
name along; she's worked with this person for years and it is someone that
will understand the importance of a  candidate that is truly interested.

One thing she asked was: "does your friend have any experience with a
community based organization, say something like RedHat or open source
(something like say, Tomcat, Open JDK) or with organizations that have a
militant presence when it comes to politics of equality, say Amnesty
International? I am asking because in the absence of experience with
something in that avenue it is very likely he will not be considered. The
number of applicants for Wikipedia's positions is always very large but
very few have any experience with a large community-based project (most
focus just in the 'big website' aspect)."

Food for thought in positioning a role with the organization. My friend was
clear that Sarah is a pro and will have some good feedback for you. She
suggested not pinging Jimmy or their CMO as they're deluged with these
requests from well-meaning folks and will only funnel me into the same
route you already applied.

I hope this helps!!
- J
