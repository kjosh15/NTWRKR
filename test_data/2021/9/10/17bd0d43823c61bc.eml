Hey Josh,

So much fun catching up. Mind if we shceudle another cqll next month so =
I can hear about Serendipity. I remember when you were first building =
that thing. We can also talk climate change then.

Also, please meet Rian Doris, both a dear friend and the CEO of the Flow =
Research Collective. I briefed him on your stuff. He=E2=80=99s super =
curious to hear more and sees some of the same opportunities I saw. =
I=E2=80=99ll let you to take this from here=E2=80=94but let me know if I =
can help along the way.

All the best,

sk
