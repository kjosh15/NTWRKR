Hey, great! We're doing a project with Wharton's People Analytics looking
at data on employee behavior and how it maps to gender bias, both
predictively and diagnostically. If the conversation you're referring to is
the one I think it was, the interest was in discussing more broadly how new
types of data are now available that can help in the above capacity, but
also more broadly how new interfaces, data collection methods, and
algorithmically controlled communication systems can improve outcomes and
reduce gender bias within companies.

TL;DR: Companies have more data than ever, and many of the systems that are
generating it can be used to address gender imbalances - or accidentally
worsen them. The Women Executive 50 group was suggested as a group that
would be interested in exploring the topic in more depth.

Does that help?
