*Promote Greater Transparency To Empower Better Digital Transformation *





     Organizations can=E2=80=99t escape Covid=E2=80=99s evolving =E2=80=98w=
ork from home=E2=80=99
imperatives. Leaderships worldwide constantly revisit and revise
expectations around employee performance, productivity, engagement and
mental health. They have little choice; their talent demands it. To be
sure, Covid-driven digitalization transforms management=E2=80=99s ability t=
o track
what =E2=80=93 and how =E2=80=93 their people do. But this =E2=80=98New Nor=
mal=E2=80=99 of networked
oversight and insight imposes organizational imperatives of its own:
increased visibility significantly increases the risk of institutional and
interpersonal conflict. Those conflicts challenge cultural norms.

    Many workers already fear that enhanced monitoring empowers management
=E2=80=93 and micromanagement - at their expense. Greater transparency is
experienced as corporate =E2=80=98surveillance=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 a perceiv=
ed breach of trust and
invasion of privacy, especially given their =E2=80=98work from home=E2=80=
=99 circumstances.
That=E2=80=99s not sustainable; no one wants to feel spied on.* Even worse,=
 instead
of clarify competing priorities, transparency often exposes and provokes
core values clashes. Are your distributed work team interactions, for
example, appropriately diverse, equitable, inclusive and productive? The
network =E2=80=98knows;=E2=80=99 when will you? Workers in general =E2=80=
=93 and remote workers in
particular =E2=80=93 want credible narratives explaining how visibility=E2=
=80=99s benefits
clearly outweigh its costs. Consequently, if not ironically, leaders are
being pushed to be far more transparent about transparency.

     Ongoing digital transformation effectively pincers people between
=E2=80=98values-driven=E2=80=99 transparency and =E2=80=98transparency-driv=
en=E2=80=99 values. The
former celebrates
creating ever-greater visibility around core values and compliance; the
latter emerges as increased visibility lets more people see where, when and
how core values compete, complement and conflict. The more engaged the
worker, the greater their concerns. As performance analytics and cultural
analytics visibly converge, leaderships look beyond legacy KPIs to
operationally assess how well people align with espoused values. They have
no choice but to rethink how they balance principles and productivity.

   Netflix, for example, offers a troubling =E2=80=98case study=E2=80=99 of=
 consequential
values clash. A digitally sophisticated innovator committed to =E2=80=98rad=
ically
transparent=E2=80=99 culture, the company effectively =E2=80=98fired=E2=80=
=99 three executives who
had overtly criticized colleagues on an internal Slack channel. Although
the remarks were not deemed =E2=80=98demeaning=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98abusive=
,=E2=80=99 their behavior defied
a core Netflix ethos.

   =E2=80=9CVery early on at Netflix, Reed Hastings wrote a culture memo fo=
r the
company with Patty McCord, then our head of talent,=E2=80=9D wrote Co-CEO a=
nd Chief
Content Officer Ted Sandaros on a LinkedIn post defending the terminations.
=E2=80=9CAt its heart was the notion of integrity and feedback, which they
described as =E2=80=98You only say things about fellow employees you say to=
 their
face.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D The trio were sacked because their comments were =
=E2=80=9Centirely
inconsistent with those values=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=9D

   To be sure, Sarandos explicitly noted that Netflix wasn=E2=80=99t and is=
n=E2=80=99t
digitally looking for trouble: =E2=80=9C=E2=80=A6we don't proactively monit=
or Slack or
email. The Slack channel was open, so anyone could access the conversations
even though the employees concerned thought it was private.=E2=80=9D

   The unavoidable inference: Netflix=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98radical transparen=
cy=E2=80=99 empowers =E2=80=93
even obligates =E2=80=93leaders to act upon values violations. =E2=80=98Tur=
ning a blind
eye=E2=80=99 is antithetical to transparency=E2=80=99s promised virtues. Ne=
vertheless,
Netflix executives don=E2=80=99t wish to be seen as =E2=80=98proactively=E2=
=80=99 policing their
people. So where should leadership draw its digital lines? If management
avoids active or passive =E2=80=98values surveillance,=E2=80=99 does that t=
acitly encourage
workers to become digital tattletales? Or is digital discretion the better
part of valor? Between =E2=80=98championing core values=E2=80=99 and ongoin=
g =E2=80=98transparency
creep,=E2=80=99 these leadership questions are neither rhetorical nor hypot=
hetical.
People need to know how their leaders balance =E2=80=98values=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98performance.=E2=80=99

   Even well-intentioned digital efforts to improve oversight and insight
may thus prove counterproductive. A global bank, concerned about
work-from-home employee engagement and morale, combined weekly =E2=80=98eng=
agement
surveys=E2=80=99 with =E2=80=98sentiment analysis=E2=80=99 to see which geo=
graphies and global work
groups were doing well or =E2=80=98at risk.=E2=80=99 Was the bank being app=
ropriately
supportive and a good (remote) place to work. The pandemic encouraged a
hybrid =E2=80=98transparency-driven values=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98values dri=
ven transparency=E2=80=99
analytic approach.

   When correlated to KPIs, however, the numbers fell all over the lot:
several measurably =E2=80=98unhappy=E2=80=99 groups seemed to perform quite=
 well while many
underperforming regions and functions appeared =E2=80=98reasonably=E2=80=99=
 engaged.
Initial analyses left leaders clueless and confused. As one HR analytics
expert at the bank observed, =E2=80=98We thought these data would give us i=
nsights
to help inform managers=E2=80=A6..I think we ended up upsetting more manage=
rs than
we helped.=E2=80=9D

   One crucial takeaway: the bank=E2=80=99s analytic leadership recognized =
the need
to consult with both managers and employees about what =E2=80=98they=E2=80=
=99 wanted to
learn. Transparency needed to be more than an executive resource or
privileged perk. To their credit, bank leadership agreed. What began as a
generic data-driven =E2=80=98report card=E2=80=99 is evolving into a more a=
ctionable
resource for the bank=E2=80=99s workers and managers. Democratizing transpa=
rency
made it more valuable for more people. That insight was the seed for a
cultural, organizational and technological shift.

   The larger organizational =E2=80=98call to action=E2=80=99 implications =
should be clear:
Transparency =E2=80=93 like capital, compensation and, yes, digital transfo=
rmation
=E2=80=93 requires explicit purpose and policies. Leaders =E2=80=93 not jus=
t HR and IT
administrators=E2=80=93 should explicitly manage transparency an enterprise=
 asset.
=E2=80=98Return on Visibility=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 the belief that measurable=
 value can be had from
ethically monitoring people and processes =E2=80=93is less provocative =E2=
=80=98thought
experiment=E2=80=99 than credible KPI. Culturally, greater visibility shoul=
d make
workers feel more empowered, not more vulnerable or exposed. Again,
authentic leaderships can=E2=80=99t credibly hide digital transparency=E2=
=80=99s role or
rule as an instrument of managerial control.

   That means, pace Netflix, workforces should know where leaders
unambiguously champion =E2=80=98values driven transparency=E2=80=99 and how=
 they will
reconcile =E2=80=98transparency driven values=E2=80=99 clash. There=E2=80=
=99s no shortage of =E2=80=98use
cases=E2=80=99 and real-world scenarios  inviting companies to better artic=
ulate
visibility=E2=80=99s virtues and vices. =E2=80=98Informed consent=E2=80=99 =
has a key role to play:
Should firms, for example, create and publish =E2=80=98calendar rights=E2=
=80=99 that make
people=E2=80=99s calendars more accessible and sharable for scheduling meet=
ings and
deliverables? Should teams be encouraged =E2=80=93 or required =E2=80=93 to=
 see the
=E2=80=98sentiment analytics=E2=80=99 associated with their project or proc=
ess =E2=80=98workflows=E2=80=99?
More provocatively, why not let colleagues see each other=E2=80=99s intra-f=
irm
=E2=80=98social graphs=E2=80=99 to see who they have in common and what int=
roductions might
make sense?

   Many of these questions were anticipated by Google=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98Pr=
oject Aristotle=E2=80=99
team dynamics research initiative almost a decade ago. The data-driven
digital juggernaut had quantified =E2=80=93 and learned =E2=80=93 the hard =
way that the
best people didn=E2=80=99t always make the best teams. Interpersonal dynami=
cs,
behaviors and norms =E2=80=93 team culture =E2=80=93 mattered enormously, a=
s did their
management and facilitation. Greater transparency, visibility and clarity
around those dimensions proved empirically essential to both greater morale
and greater effectiveness. Google=E2=80=99s technology leadership didn=E2=
=80=99t just
understand this, they culturally championed it.*

  . Pro-actively clarifying how =E2=80=98core values=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98=
digital transparency=E2=80=99
co-evolve is leadership=E2=80=99s hard work. Much the way leaderships once
championed =E2=80=98digital transformation roadmaps,=E2=80=99 they need to =
communicate
=E2=80=98transparency roadmaps.=E2=80=99 Assuring that greater visibility i=
mproves and
empowers people=E2=80=99s jobs, engagement and alignment should not be a di=
gital
transformation byproduct or afterthought; it is leadership=E2=80=99s duty a=
nd
obligation.

    Vendors increasingly recognize and acknowledge that the =E2=80=98survei=
llance=E2=80=99
brand of managerial oversight and control is not ethically, culturally or
legally sustainable. Firms like ActiveTrack, whose growth skyrocketed
during the pandemic because managers were desperate to monitor their
newly-remote and distributed workforces, now look to position themselves as
analytic resources to help mentor, coach and advise remote teams and
performers. Start-ups such like Indigo Metrics, by contrast, explicitly
seek to digitally assess how well team dynamics reflect and respect the
firm=E2=80=99s culture. They=E2=80=99re pushing for greater cultural transp=
arency to
promote healthier performance and productivity. Making culture more
transparent invariably makes both performance and productivity more
transparent; making performance and productivity more transparent
inevitably makes culture more transparent. This is digital transformation=
=E2=80=99s
destination and destination.

    McKinsey=E2=80=99s Marvin Bower once defined culture as =E2=80=98the wa=
y we do things
around here.=E2=80=99 Transparency and visibility mean everyone can now rea=
lly see
corporate culture. A more cynical observer once remarked that, =E2=80=98cul=
ture is
what people do when nobody=E2=80=99s looking.=E2=80=9D Transparency=E2=80=
=99s irresistible rise
means that looking is always an option. How those options are responsibly,
ethically and productively exercised will define tomorrow=E2=80=99s digital
cultures at work.
