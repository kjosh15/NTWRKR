Good to hear from you too! Exciting to think of the alpacas - it must be so
interesting to see the generations change.

Also good to hear about your health - and +1 on the zoom fatigue! That
said, if you're available we'd love to see your smiling faces some time.

Very useful to know that empty-nesting is advisable. Our kids are growing
fast (it's a cliche, but holy smokes it's the case!) so an empty nest is on
the horizon.

Iceland is indeed gorgeous; we spent the summer in an RV exploring it.
Being able to see more of the country, and especially places we hadn't been
to, was just wonderful.

We're doing very well; the boys have new teachers and seem to be thriving
(although we do worry about the small pool of peers available to them), and
Hulda enrolled in an Occupational Therapy course at the local university
and seems to be loving it. I've been doubling down on my startup, which is
growing nicely and having a decent impact in improving people's lives -
which is very rewarding.

So overall everything is lovely; we're in a big beautiful farmhouse with
fiber internet and plenty of meaningful work to occupy our time. What else
could you ask for?? ;)

Let us know if you're ever game for a bit more zoom time, and all best
wishes in the meantime.

Much love,
Josh

    <div>Hi Josh (and Hulda),</div>
    <div>Good to hear from you!</div>
    <div>All is well. Yes August was our main
      month for alpaca births this year, but in a fairly low-key way. We
      have four new ones, and most likely just one more still to come.
      But they are extremely cute, as always. Two of them are a
      beautiful shiny true-black - the new stud seems well able to pass
      on his colour so we&#39;re on track to see more of the darker shades =
I
      want for my weaving.</div>
    <div>Healthwise, great. I&#39;m still getting
      stronger and more energetic as I slim down (albeit slowly now),
      but it is wonderful to have the energy for the things I want to do
      even if I do end up squandering too much of it on zoom meetings.<br>
    </div>
    <div>We keep busy, as ever, never short of
      projects and interests. Having kids around was maybe the ultimate
      project, but I can highly recommend empty-nesting! There is so
      much more time to pursue your own things *and* you get to hear of
      all the interesting things they get up to.</div>
    <div>That said, Iceland looks stunning in
      the few photos I&#39;ve seen. I wonder how you can get anything at al=
l
      done with surroundings like that to distract you. How are you
      all?! <br>
