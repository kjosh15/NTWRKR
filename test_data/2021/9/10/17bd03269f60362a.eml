Thanks, Simon! Wasn't able to chase anything down for CIV:LAB yet, hence my
radio silence. I recently got an intro to Dave Couture, the Managing
Partner, Technology Strategy & Partnerships at Deloitte. Can I speak to him
first and then circle back about connecting to their Purpose team?

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help move things forward
in the meantime!

Very much obliged,
- J
