*TL;DR: Are you seeing large companies continue to be slow to adopt as a
result of the pandemic and the "summer slump," or am I not being aggressive
enough in seeking new markets?*

Things are still... slow. Personally I've gotten a couple new leads on
potential side contracts, speaking opportunities, and podcast/TV gigs, but
my main goal - growing and selling Indigometrics - is crawling along. Our
existing clients are expanding their subscriptions at a nice clip, but new
customers? Only one or two.

Confusingly, it's not just crickets - everyone wants to talk to us, and to
schedule more meetings - but everything is being done later. First
September, now October. Which leaves us wondering: is it us, or is it them?

At present we're still testing the same three markets for growth; large
consultancies, L&D (Learning and Development) providers, and asset
management firms for whom we also represent a potential ESG metric. Any of
them could be powerful reseller partners, allowing us to focus on our
(substantially increased) collection of unique data.

We're using the time well, building out our backend infrastructure,
monitoring, onboarding, and related materials. And some disrupters are in
the works; a whitepaper partnership with Wharton, or an HBR article on our
platform's use for D&I, as example. But we're not seeing the new customer
numbers we'll need to entertain acquisition conversations in the near term.

Any feedback from the markets you have insight into would be appreciated!

All best wishes from sunny Iceland,
Josh
