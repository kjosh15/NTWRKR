I have to pay estimated taxes in the US (by the 15th), and to determine the
best estimates it'd be helpful to have an idea of what I'm likely to pay in
Iceland. Would an overview on my anticipated income for 2021 help, or can
we make this based off the planned $5k USD/month schedule we're hoping to
launch soon?

Much obliged,
Josh
