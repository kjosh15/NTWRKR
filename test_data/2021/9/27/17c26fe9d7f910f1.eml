I've been working on my CGM test protocol proposal and am speaking to some
senior executives at Novo Nordisk and J&J. I'd like to propose Iceland as a
potential test case and potentially partner with DeCode to run the
logistics. Do you have any contacts there?

Otherwise I hope you all are doing well - we've just gotten our first snow,
so can confidently say summer is OVER. :)

All the best,
Josh
