Here is an incredible story about Ozy, a digital media startup. Ozy was loo=
king to raise a $40 million investment from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.=E2=80=
=99s asset management arm, on the strength of the traffic to its=C2=A0websi=
te, newsletters and YouTube videos. As part of its due diligence, Goldman w=
anted to do a call with YouTube. Carlos Watson, the =E2=80=9Ccharismatic ch=
ief executive=E2=80=9D of Ozy, gave Goldman a Gmail address for YouTube exe=
cutive Alex Piper, and Ozy set up a call between Piper and Goldman in early=
 February.On the call, Piper said nice things about Ozy, but =E2=80=9Cthe m=
an=E2=80=99s voice began to sound strange to the Goldman Sachs team, as tho=
ugh it might have been digitally altered.=E2=80=9D So Goldman =E2=80=9Creac=
hed out to Mr. Piper, not through the Gmail address that Mr. Watson had pro=
vided before the meeting, but through Mr. Piper=E2=80=99s assistant at YouT=
ube.=E2=80=9D And it turned out he had not been on the call: Samir Rao, Ozy=
=E2=80=99s co-founder and chief operating officer, had allegedly=C2=A0been =
impersonating him in order to trick Goldman into investing in Ozy.[1]Ordina=
rily if I were telling you this story I=E2=80=99d be quoting from a federal=
 criminal complaint, or at least a Securities and Exchange Commission enfor=
cement action, but nope everything is fine! I=E2=80=99m quoting from a New =
York Times column by Ben Smith, nobody has been charged with anything, and =
Watson and Rao remain at Ozy and keep raising money. (Not from Goldman, whi=
ch passed on the deal, but =E2=80=9Cin April, two months after Goldman Sach=
s walked away, the company raised another round of financing.=E2=80=9D) Smi=
th writes:In his apology to Goldman Sachs and in an email to me on Friday, =
Mr. Watson attributed the incident to a mental health crisis and shared wha=
t he said were details of Mr. Rao=E2=80=99s diagnosis.=E2=80=9CSamir is a v=
alued colleague and a close friend,=E2=80=9D Mr. Watson said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=
=80=99m proud that we stood by him while he struggled, and we=E2=80=99re al=
l glad to see him now thriving again.=E2=80=9DHe added that Mr. Rao took ti=
me off from work after the call and is now back at Ozy. Mr. Rao did not rep=
ly to requests for comment.Marc Lasry, a hedge fund manager, a co-owner of =
the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and chairman of the Ozy board, said in =
a statement: =E2=80=9CThe board was made aware of the incident, and we full=
y support the way it was handled. The incident was an unfortunate one-time =
event, and Carlos and his team showed the kind of compassion we would all w=
ant if any of us faced a difficult situation in our own lives.=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=A6Goldman Sachs took no further action after the call with the Ozy exec=
utive who had apparently impersonated the YouTube executive. But the securi=
ty team at Google, which owns YouTube, determined a crime might have been c=
ommitted.Google has alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two people=
 with knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs then received an inquiry =
from federal law enforcement officials, one person with knowledge of that i=
nquiry said.The guy=C2=A0impersonated a YouTube executive to trick someone=
=C2=A0into investing?=C2=A0You=E2=80=99re just not going to get an easier s=
ecurities fraud case than that, and neither =E2=80=9Cit didn=E2=80=99t work=
=E2=80=9D nor =E2=80=9Che was having a tough time=E2=80=9D nor =E2=80=9Cit =
only happened once=E2=80=9D are generally defenses to fraud charges! Ozy=E2=
=80=99s board =E2=80=9Cdid not formally investigate=E2=80=9D! The CEO of th=
e company gave a potential investor a fake email address for a big customer=
, and then the COO digitally altered his voice to impersonate that customer=
 on a call with the investor, and the board decided not to investigate beca=
use ... they were satisfied that this was just a one-time thing, a little o=
opsie,=C2=A0everything else that the company does is completely aboveboard,=
 and anyway no harm no foul?Here=E2=80=99s  the thing about being a private=
 company. You can sort of =E2=80=A6=C2=A0say stuff. If you are a public com=
pany and you say =E2=80=9Cwe have the highest traffic of any media site in =
the world,=E2=80=9D and it=E2=80=99s not true, someone will sue you for sec=
urities fraud. Everything you say in public,=C2=A0you say to investors, and=
 if it=E2=80=99s wrong you get in trouble. If you are a private company and=
 you say =E2=80=9Cwe have the highest traffic of any media site in the worl=
d,=E2=80=9D there can be various footnotes and caveats that you think but d=
on=E2=80=99t say, you can cross=C2=A0your fingers behind your back, it=E2=
=80=99s fine. You don=E2=80=99t have to follow generally accepted accountin=
g principles or use words in their ordinary meanings in your public stateme=
nts.[2] The public can=E2=80=99t buy your stock so it doesn=E2=80=99t matte=
r. You sell stock only occasionally, in negotiated transactions with sophis=
ticated investors; you sign agreements with those investors in which they e=
ssentially disclaim any reliance on anything that you=E2=80=99ve said outsi=
de of the deal documents.=C2=A0But! When those sophisticated investors do t=
heir due diligence, they will ask you specific questions. You will say in p=
ublic =E2=80=9Cwe have the highest traffic of any media site in the world,=
=E2=80=9D and the investors will send you a list of questions like =E2=80=
=9Chow many unique visitors did you have in each of the last 12=C2=A0months=
=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cdescribe all commercial arrangements in which you pa=
y for traffic=E2=80=9D and other stuff designed to tease out exactly how bi=
g and good your traffic is. They will do this because they are sophisticate=
d investors; they understand that your public statements are for different =
audiences, and that in any case you are a  visionary private-company founde=
r and when you say stuff it sometimes reflects your confidence in your comp=
any=E2=80=99s bright future rather than present-day reality. So they will j=
ust quietly, behind the scenes, ask you boring factual questions to see how=
 close your claims are to reality. And you will respond with the boring fac=
tual answers. And if those answers don=E2=80=99t quite correspond to your b=
old claims then, you know, that=E2=80=99s fine, that=E2=80=99s how startups=
 work; they won=E2=80=99t necessarily pass on the investment just because t=
he boring financial reality of your business doesn=E2=80=99t yet match your=
 vision.=C2=A0It=E2=80=99s just that=C2=A0if you lie to them in due diligen=
ce that ruins the whole deal. If they ask for a customer call during due di=
ligence, and you impersonate the customer to give them the answers you want=
 them to hear, come on, come on, come on, come on.Here=E2=80=99s another th=
ing about being a private company. What if this had worked? What if Goldman=
 hadn=E2=80=99t noticed anything unusual and had coughed up the $40 million=
? Wouldn=E2=80=99t Goldman have been embarrassed when this story came out? =
Well, no, because this story never would have come out! Even if someone had=
 told Goldman after the fact =E2=80=9Chey that call with YouTube was fake,=
=E2=80=9D what would they have done about it? They could call Ozy and deman=
d their money back but presumably Ozy=C2=A0spent it. They could sue, but ho=
w much would they be able to recover? Once you=E2=80=99ve been=C2=A0tricked=
 into investing in a high-flying startup, the only rational move is to hope=
 that they succeed, clean up their act and go public at a higher valuation.=
 You=E2=80=99d never go around saying =E2=80=9Cwe were tricked=E2=80=9D; th=
at just destroys value.Similarly,=C2=A0if you are an=C2=A0investor and boar=
d member of a hot startup, and you find out that the co-founder impersonate=
d a customer to try to trick someone into investing, what are your incentiv=
es? If you make a big deal about it and throw around words like =E2=80=9Cfr=
aud,=E2=80=9D it will be hard for the startup ever to raise money again, wh=
ich might make your own investment worthless. If you say, meh, unfortunate =
one-time event, no harm no foul, then maybe the company=E2=80=99s vision wi=
ll end up working out and you=E2=80=99ll be able to sell=C2=A0at a profit. =
If you invest in a startup you are buying an option; your goal, as a board =
member, is not to extinguish the option value too soon. Just, you know, let=
 it ride, see where this goes.I am appalled, sure,=C2=A0but honestly=C2=A0I=
 also admire it a bit. I feel like there is some threshold of absolute sham=
elessness that most companies cannot even aspire to, but if you reach it=C2=
=A0then either you blow up in short order or you take over the world. I=E2=
=80=99ll probably=C2=A0be working for Ozy in a year.

      Mind Your Own Business Act
   =20
 =20
The way corporate law generally works in the U.S. is:=09Corporate law is a =
matter of=C2=A0state=C2=A0law. Securities law is federal =E2=80=94=C2=A0if =
companies lie about their securities to raise money they get in federal tro=
uble=C2=A0=E2=80=94=C2=A0but=C2=A0corporate=C2=A0law, and in particular the=
 fiduciary duties of directors to shareholders, is state law. Delaware law,=
 mostly, because big U.S.=C2=A0public companies are mostly incorporated in =
Delaware, and Delaware has specialized judges who are good at business law.=
=09Corporate law is generally deferential to directors. If the directors ma=
ke a decision on behalf of the company, and a shareholder disagrees, and th=
e shareholder comes to a Delaware court saying =E2=80=9Cthis company introd=
uced a big new smartphone but I think that a smaller phone would fit in my =
hands=C2=A0better,=E2=80=9D the court will not be interested. The =E2=80=9C=
business judgment rule=E2=80=9D generally requires courts to defer to direc=
tors=E2=80=99 business decisions. There are exceptions where a court will s=
crutinize directors=E2=80=99 decisions more closely, but generally that req=
uires the shareholder to prove some conflict of interest, some personal int=
erest of the director that makes it impossible for her to be loyal to share=
holders.What if we reversed that? What if we made corporate law federal, an=
d required courts to reverse directors=E2=80=99 business decisions=C2=A0unl=
ess the=C2=A0directors=C2=A0could prove=C2=A0that they were the correct dec=
isions? You don=E2=80=99t like the size of the new iPhone, you sue Apple In=
c. in=C2=A0federal court anywhere in the U.S., and then the burden is on Ap=
ple to prove to a jury that the new iPhone is the right size. If the jury d=
isagrees then the directors are personally liable for damages.=C2=A0Would t=
his be a good system?No, come on, that is the dumbest=C2=A0paragraph I have=
 typed in 10 years of typing paragraphs about business, but here we are, he=
re we are, here we are:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Mind =
Your Own Business Act, which would enable shareholders to hold woke corpora=
tions accountable. Specifically, the legislation would require corporate di=
rectors to prove their =E2=80=9Cwoke=E2=80=9D corporate actions were in the=
ir shareholders=E2=80=99 best interest in order to avoid liability for brea=
ch of fiduciary duty in shareholder litigation over corporate actions relat=
ing to certain social policies. It would also incentivize corporate managem=
ent to stop abusing their positions to advance left-wing social policies by=
 increasing their personal liability to shareholders for breaches of fiduci=
ary duty resulting from those policies. Rubio announced the bill during an =
appearance with Maria Bartiromo on Mornings with Maria and in a Fox Busines=
s op-ed. =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9CNo more legal tricks that shield these corporate=
 executives from accountability,=E2=80=9D Rubio continued. =E2=80=9CIf they=
 really believe that being woke is good for business, they should have to s=
ay so=E2=80=94and prove it=E2=80=94under oath in court.=E2=80=9DRubio=E2=80=
=99s Mind Your Own Business Act is a private-sector solution to the problem=
 of woke corporations. Specifically the bill:=C2=A0Requires large public co=
mpanies listing on national stock exchanges to provide shareholders with si=
gnificant holdings with certain privileges with respect to claims for breac=
h of fiduciary duty under covered circumstances.Covered circumstances inclu=
de if a company takes an action on a primarily non-pecuniary basis in respo=
nse to State law, boycotts a class of persons or industry on a primarily no=
n-pecuniary basis, or uses primarily non-pecuniary public reasoning for an =
action.Corporate defendants would be bound by presumptions that pecuniary i=
nterest does not include common defenses used to defend exercises of busine=
ss judgment, including the media image of the company or employee morale.En=
sures that for claims of breach of fiduciary duty against management brough=
t by shareholders under these covered circumstances, management would have =
the burden of proof and, if found in breach of their duties, be liable with=
out indemnification by the company for a minimum amount of damages and atto=
rney=E2=80=99s fees.=C2=A0Here is the text of his proposed bill, which is v=
astly sillier even than my summary, or his. It allows shareholders to sue s=
pecifically for decisions involving a =E2=80=9Ccovered divisive concept,=E2=
=80=9D it somehow plans to federalize corporate law through stock-exchange =
listings requirements that would require corporate charter amendments to sp=
ecify burdens of proof and treble damages for these lawsuits, and it specif=
ically presumes that it cannot be reasonable for a company to care about em=
ployee retention, public relations or marketing. =E2=80=9CWe bought ads on =
television to sell shoes,=E2=80=9D a shoe company would say, and Marco Rubi=
o would say =E2=80=9Caha, that is not in your pecuniary interests, that is =
just woke capitalism.=E2=80=9D I do not begin to understand it but I assume=
 it is mostly just trolling.

Elsewhere in shareholder rights, partisan politics and trolling, here's a s=
hareholder proposal that someone got on the proxy statement at Fox Corp., a=
sking Fox to become a public benefit corporation, and =E2=80=9Cthat one of =
the public benefits included in the amendment be provision of the Company=
=E2=80=99s viewers with an accurate understanding of current events through=
 the exercise of journalistic integrity.=E2=80=9D The idea is that a regula=
r corporation has fiduciary duties only to its shareholders, and tends to m=
aximize profits, while a public benefit corporation has to =E2=80=9Cbalance=
 the interests of shareholders, stakeholders, and those public benefits ide=
ntified in the Company=E2=80=99s certificate of incorporation,=C2=A0allowin=
g the corporation to protect communities, even when doing so does not optim=
ize financial return.=E2=80=9D The shareholder proposing this, in other wor=
ds, wants Fox to have a corporate=C2=A0fiduciary duty to journalistic accur=
acy, even when it=E2=80=99s not profitable.This is, to be clear, pure troll=
ing; Rupert Murdoch owns 41% of the voting stock of Fox, the board opposes =
the proposal (=E2=80=9CWe are purveyors of First Amendment activities,=E2=
=80=9D it says), it won=E2=80=99t go anywhere, and even if it won a majorit=
y of votes=C2=A0it is non-binding.=C2=A0Nothing will come of this.Still I w=
anted to quote these paragraphs in the case for the shareholder proposal:Mi=
sinformation can put democracy at risk, threaten public interest in the env=
ironment, and undermine public health. These threats could be prioritized a=
t a PBC, even if doing so sacrificed financial return.The vast majority of =
our diversified shareholders lose when companies harm the economy, because =
the value of diversified portfolios rises and falls with GDP.=C2=A0While a =
concentrated holder may profit when the Company inflicts costs on society b=
y emphasizing viewership over accuracy, diversified shareholders internaliz=
e those costs.I don=E2=80=99t think that anyone could have written those pa=
ragraphs a decade ago. The argument here is that (1) most of Fox=E2=80=99s =
shareholders are diversified (other than Murdoch of course), (2) diversifie=
d shareholders, in some sense,=C2=A0own the entire world, and (3) if a comp=
any=E2=80=99s activities are bad for the world, they are bad for its (diver=
sified) shareholders, even if they are lucrative for the company. This is a=
 theory that we talk about a lot around here,[3] and it is in some sense a=
=C2=A0new=C2=A0theory. A decade ago there were plenty of diversified shareh=
olders and index funds, but it was not common to=C2=A0talk to=C2=A0sharehol=
ders as though they were owners of the whole world. You would say, in your =
shareholder proposals, =E2=80=9Cthis is good for Fox=E2=80=99s long-term va=
lue=E2=80=9D or whatever. You wouldn=E2=80=99t say =E2=80=9Cthis is bad for=
 Fox, but good for the world, and as a Fox shareholder you own a lot of oth=
er companies too so you should care about the world, not just Fox.=E2=80=9D=
And while I see that sort of=C2=A0argument a lot now, this might be=C2=A0th=
e first time I=E2=80=99ve seen it=C2=A0in a proxy statement. When Engine No=
. 1 LLC  ran a proxy fight to replace several of Exxon Mobil Corp.=E2=80=99=
s directors in May, it positioned itself as a greener and=C2=A0more sustain=
able choice than=C2=A0Exxon=E2=80=99s board. But its rhetoric was all about=
 creating better long-term value=C2=A0for Exxon Mobil.=C2=A0Engine No. 1 sa=
id things like =E2=80=9CExxonMobil has significantly underperformed and has=
 failed to adjust its strategy to enhance long-term value=E2=80=9D and =E2=
=80=9Ca=C2=A0lack of successful and transformative energy experience on the=
 Board has left ExxonMobil unprepared and threatens continued long-term val=
ue destruction,=E2=80=9D not, like, =E2=80=9Cyou probably own real estate t=
oo, and if Exxon keeps drilling oil the rising oceans will flood it=E2=80=
=9D or whatever. =E2=80=9CYou own other stocks, so vote your shares of this=
 company to maximize the value of your overall portfolio=E2=80=9D is still =
a weird thing to say, directly, to shareholders. But it makes sense, and it=
=E2=80=99s becoming less weird.

Elsewhere  in woke capital:Five investment giants -- BlackRock Inc., Goldma=
n Sachs Asset Management, Lord, Abbett & Co., Morgan Stanley Investment Man=
agement and Vanguard Group Inc. -- are working with two minority-owned unde=
rwriters, Loop Capital Markets and Siebert Williams Shank & Co., to develop=
 and distribute a questionnaire that governments will be asked to fill out =
before new bond deals are arranged. It will ask about policing policies, ef=
forts to combat race-based inequality, social services and the demographic =
breakdown of the government=E2=80=99s workforce, among other things. =E2=80=
=A6The firms aren=E2=80=99t bound to use the information in their investmen=
t decisions, nor will the underwriters require governments to participate. =
Yet backers said the involvement of such massive investment companies gives=
 the project significant heft and lets governments know that social concern=
s are beginning to matter to buyers of their bonds.=C2=A0=E2=80=9CThese are=
 among the largest municipal bond holders; they are mammoth institutions th=

ill be increasingly scrutinized.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0Look, if the government does=
n=E2=80=99t like certain big investors=E2=80=99 views on social matters, it=
 can go around threatening them with changes to fiduciary law and treble da=

e certain governments=E2=80=99=C2=A0views on social matters, they can go ar=

      Wash trading
   =20
 =20
The way a lot of U.S. market structure works is that an exchange will pay t=
raders to create liquidity (by posting bids and offers on the exchange), an=
d will charge traders for taking liquidity (by sending market orders that e=
xecute against those posted bids and offers). This creates incentives for t=
raders to post orders on exchanges, which makes those exchanges better plac=
es to trade: If you want to buy a stock on the exchange, you can do so inst=
antly, because the exchange is paying people to provide liquidity (and char=
ging you for it). This is sometimes called =E2=80=9Cmaker-taker=E2=80=9D pr=
icing and is controversial for various reasons but never mind that.Here for=
 instance is how one options exchange works:At all times relevant to this C=
omplaint, Exchange A charged a take fee of 50 cents per contract and, at th=
e highest volume tier, paid a make rebate of 53 cents per contract. Exchang=
e A paid the 3 cents difference itself to incentivize liquidity on the exch=
ange.An options contract is generally for 100 shares. So you can make about=
 half a penny per share by providing liquidity in this contract.These fees =
are generally paid to brokerage firms that send the orders to the exchange.=
 Some brokerage firms pass them on to customers: If you send a liquidity-cr=
eating order, the brokerage gets 53 cents and passes most of it to you=C2=
=A0(for instance it gives you 43 cents and keeps 10); if you send a liquidi=
ty-taking order, the broker pays 50 cents and charges you for it. Other bro=
kerages do not; they keep the make fees for themselves and pay the take fee=
s themselves.=C2=A0One thing you could do is trade options back and forth w=
ith yourself using two different brokers, one of which does pass on the mak=
er-taker fees and one of which doesn=E2=80=99t. You send non-marketable lim=
it orders to one broker who passes on the fees, you send offsetting market =
orders through another broker who doesn=E2=80=99t, your one order trades wi=
th your other order, you get paid a maker fee for providing liquidity to yo=
urself and you don=E2=80=99t get charged a taker fee for taking liquidity f=
rom yourself. Since you=E2=80=99re trading with yourself you have no market=
 risk; you=E2=80=99re just collecting the 43 cents per contract.=C2=A0You s=
hould not do this for several reasons. One, it=E2=80=99s illegal; trading w=
ith yourself is called =E2=80=9Cwash trading=E2=80=9D and is not allowed. T=
wo, the brokers don=E2=80=99t want you to do this, and you will need to eng=
age in some subterfuge to get them to approve your accounts. Three, it is r=
isky: If someone=C2=A0else=C2=A0sends in an order while you are doing this,=
 you might trade with them instead of yourself, and then you=E2=80=99ll hav=
e market risk; you=E2=80=99ll=C2=A0be on the hook for whatever options you =
are buying or selling. Four, we are talking about 43 cents per contract. If=
 you trade 100 options contracts, representing 10,000 shares of stock, you =
will make $43 doing this, before your commissions and other costs. You need=
 to do this in huge size to make any money,=C2=A0it seems time-consuming an=
d tedious, and if any of your hundreds of orders trade with a real person r=
ather than with yourself it=E2=80=99s very risky.Here is a fun Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission enforcement action:The Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion today charged a Florida resident and his friend for engaging in a fra=
udulent scheme designed to collect liquidity rebates from exchanges by wash=
 trading put options of certain "meme stocks" in early 2021.According to th=
e SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Distri=
ct of New Jersey, starting in late February 2021, Suyun Gu became aware of =
the increased market volume and volatility driven by so-called "meme stocks=
" =E2=80=93 stocks that were being actively promoted on social media platfo=
rms. Gu allegedly then devised a scheme to take advantage of the "maker-tak=
er" program offered by exchanges by trading options of these stocks with hi=
mself. ...The SEC's complaint alleges that Gu was able to generate illicit =
profits by using broker-dealer accounts that passed rebates back to their c=
ustomers to place initial orders on one side of the market, and then using =
broker-dealer accounts that did not charge fees for taking liquidity for hi=
s subsequent orders on the other side of the market. When identifying a pro=
duct to trade, Gu and his friend and business associate, Yong Lee, selected=
 far out-of-the-money put options on some "meme stocks," which they thought=
 would be easier to trade against themselves because interest in buying the=
 "meme stocks" and related price increases would make put options on those =
stocks less attractive. ... The complaint alleges that Gu executed approxim=
ately 11,400 trades with himself, netting at least $668,671 in liquidity-re=
bates, and that Lee executed approximately 2,300 trades with himself, netti=
ng $51,334 in liquidity-rebates. In addition to collecting these ill-gotten=
 rebates, the wash trading scheme allegedly impacted the market as it skewe=
d the volume in certain option contracts and induced other traders to place=
 trades in otherwise illiquid option contracts.The point of doing this in m=
eme stocks is, paradoxically, to=C2=A0avoid=C2=A0trading with anyone else, =
because this scheme only works if you can be sure of only trading against y=
ourself. If everyone is buying a meme stock and its price is shooting up, n=
obody is buying far-out-of-the-money put options to bet against=C2=A0the st=
ock. So:On March 4, 2021, Gu wash traded put options on Rocket Companies, I=
nc. (Ticker: RKT) with a $5 strike price and an expiration of June 18, 2021=
 to obtain rebates. On March 4, 2021, RKT closed the trading day at $26.86 =
per share.Gu allegedly traded 1,000 $5-strike=C2=A0put options on Rocket th=
at day, representing 100,000 shares (worth $500,000 at the put=E2=80=99s st=
rike price, or around $2.7 million at the market price that day). He made $=
430. Overall, they allegedly did about 13,790 trades for about 3.3 million =
contracts (about 330 million shares) over about two months, making about $7=
20,000 in profits after paying commissions. Also occasionally they ended up=
 trading options with other, real people. It seems like a lot of work and r=
isk. Anyway Lee settled and agreed to pay back his $51,334 plus a $25,000 f=
ine; Gu has not settled.

tartup. Ozy was looking to raise a $40 million investment from Goldman Sach=
s Group Inc.=E2=80=99s asset management arm, on the strength of the traffic=
 to its=C2=A0website, newsletters and YouTube videos. As part of its due di=
ligence, Goldman wanted to do a call with YouTube. Carlos Watson, the =E2=
=80=9Ccharismatic chief executive=E2=80=9D of Ozy, gave Goldman a Gmail add=
ress for YouTube executive Alex Piper, and Ozy set up a call between Piper =
and Goldman in early February.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">On the call,=
 Piper said nice things about Ozy, but =E2=80=9Cthe man=E2=80=99s voice beg=
an to sound strange to the Goldman Sachs team, as though it might have been=
 digitally altered.=E2=80=9D So Goldman =E2=80=9Creached out to Mr. Piper, =
not through the Gmail address that Mr. Watson had provided before the meeti=
ng, but through Mr. Piper=E2=80=99s assistant at YouTube.=E2=80=9D And it t=
urned out he had not been on the call: Samir Rao, Ozy=E2=80=99s co-founder =
and chief operating officer, had allegedly=C2=A0been impersonating him in o=
rder to trick Goldman into investing in Ozy.[1]</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px=
 0;">Ordinarily if I were telling you this story I=E2=80=99d be quoting fro=
m a federal criminal complaint, or at least a Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion enforcement action, but nope everything is fine! I=E2=80=99m quoting =
from a New York Times column by Ben Smith, nobody has been charged with any=
thing, and Watson and Rao remain at Ozy and keep raising money. (Not from G=
oldman, which passed on the deal, but =E2=80=9Cin April, two months after G=
oldman Sachs walked away, the company raised another round of financing.=E2=
=80=9D) Smith writes:</p><blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">In his ap=
ology to Goldman Sachs and in an email to me on Friday, Mr. Watson attribut=
ed the incident to a mental health crisis and shared what he said were deta=
ils of Mr. Rao=E2=80=99s diagnosis.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">=E2=80=

e=E2=80=99re all glad to see him now thriving again.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=

e call and is now back at Ozy. Mr. Rao did not reply to requests for commen=
t.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Marc Lasry, a hedge fund manager, a co-o=
wner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and chairman of the Ozy board, =
said in a statement: =E2=80=9CThe board was made aware of the incident, and=
 we fully support the way it was handled. The incident was an unfortunate o=
ne-time event, and Carlos and his team showed the kind of compassion we wou=
ld all want if any of us faced a difficult situation in our own lives.=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=A6</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Goldman Sachs took no furt=
her action after the call with the Ozy executive who had apparently imperso=
nated the YouTube executive. But the security team at Google, which owns Yo=
uTube, determined a crime might have been committed.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 16px 0;">Google has alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two peopl=
e with knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs then received an inquiry=
 from federal law enforcement officials, one person with knowledge of that =

t? Well, no, because this story never would have come out! Even if someone =
had told Goldman after the fact =E2=80=9Chey that call with YouTube was fak=
e,=E2=80=9D what would they have done about it? They could call Ozy and dem=
and their money back but presumably Ozy=C2=A0spent it. They could sue, but =
how much would they be able to recover? Once you=E2=80=99ve been=C2=A0<em>t=
ricked </em>into investing in a high-flying startup, the only rational move=
 is to hope that they succeed, clean up their act and go public at a higher=
 valuation. You=E2=80=99d never go around saying =E2=80=9Cwe were tricked=
=E2=80=9D; that just destroys value.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Simila=
rly,=C2=A0if you are an=C2=A0investor and board member of a hot startup, an=
d you find out that the co-founder impersonated a customer to try to trick =
someone into investing, what are your incentives? If you make a big deal ab=
out it and throw around words like =E2=80=9Cfraud,=E2=80=9D it will be hard=
 for the startup ever to raise money again, which might make your own inves=
tment worthless. If you say, meh, unfortunate one-time event, no harm no fo=
ul, then maybe the company=E2=80=99s vision will end up working out and you=
=E2=80=99ll be able to sell=C2=A0at a profit. If you invest in a startup yo=
u are buying an option; your goal, as a board member, is not to extinguish =
the option value too soon. Just, you know, let it ride, see where this goes=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">I am appalled, sure,=C2=A0but honestly=C2=
=A0I also admire it a bit. I feel like there is some threshold of absolute =
shamelessness that most companies cannot even aspire to, but if you reach i=
t=C2=A0then either you blow up in short order or you take over the world. I=

</table><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The way a lot of U.S. market structure=
 works is that an exchange will pay traders to create liquidity (by posting=
 bids and offers on the exchange), and will charge traders for taking liqui=
dity (by sending market orders that execute against those posted bids and o=
ffers). This creates incentives for traders to post orders on exchanges, wh=
ich makes those exchanges better places to trade: If you want to buy a stoc=
k on the exchange, you can do so instantly, because the exchange is paying =
people to provide liquidity (and charging you for it). This is sometimes ca=
lled =E2=80=9Cmaker-taker=E2=80=9D pricing and is controversial for various=
 reasons but never mind that.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Here for inst=

</a>:</p><blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">At all times relevant to =
this Complaint, Exchange A charged a take fee of 50 cents per contract and,=
 at the highest volume tier, paid a make rebate of 53 cents per contract. E=
xchange A paid the 3 cents difference itself to incentivize liquidity on th=
e exchange.</p></blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">An options contrac=
t is generally for 100 shares. So you can make about half a penny per share=
 by providing liquidity in this contract.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">T=
hese fees are generally paid to brokerage firms that send the orders to the=
 exchange. Some brokerage firms pass them on to customers: If you send a li=
quidity-creating order, the brokerage gets 53 cents and passes most of it t=
o you=C2=A0(for instance it gives you 43 cents and keeps 10); if you send a=
 liquidity-taking order, the broker pays 50 cents and charges you for it. O=
ther brokerages do not; they keep the make fees for themselves and pay the =
take fees themselves.=C2=A0</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">One thing you c=
ould do is trade options back and forth with yourself using two different b=
rokers, one of which does pass on the maker-taker fees and one of which doe=
sn=E2=80=99t. You send non-marketable limit orders to one broker who passes=
 on the fees, you send offsetting market orders through another broker who =
doesn=E2=80=99t, your one order trades with your other order, you get paid =
a maker fee for providing liquidity to yourself and you don=E2=80=99t get c=
harged a taker fee for taking liquidity from yourself. Since you=E2=80=99re=
 trading with yourself you have no market risk; you=E2=80=99re just collect=
ing the 43 cents per contract.=C2=A0</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">You sh=
ould not do this for several reasons. One, it=E2=80=99s illegal; trading wi=
th yourself is called =E2=80=9Cwash trading=E2=80=9D and is not allowed. Tw=
o, the brokers don=E2=80=99t want you to do this, and you will need to enga=
ge in some subterfuge to get them to approve your accounts. Three, it is ri=
sky: If someone=C2=A0<em>else=C2=A0</em>sends in an order while you are doi=
ng this, you might trade with them instead of yourself, and then you=E2=80=
=99ll have market risk; you=E2=80=99ll=C2=A0be on the hook for whatever opt=
ions you are buying or selling. Four, we are talking about 43 cents per con=
tract. If you trade 100 options contracts, representing 10,000 shares of st=
ock, you will make $43 doing this, before your commissions and other costs.=
 You need to do this in huge size to make any money,=C2=A0it seems time-con=
suming and tedious, and if any of your hundreds of orders trade with a real=
 person rather than with yourself it=E2=80=99s very risky.</p><p style=3D"m=

;">enforcement action</a>:</p><blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The =
Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Florida resident and his=
 friend for engaging in a fraudulent scheme designed to collect liquidity r=
ebates from exchanges by wash trading put options of certain "meme stocks" =
in early 2021.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">According to the SEC's compl=
aint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jer=
sey, starting in late February 2021, Suyun Gu became aware of the increased=
 market volume and volatility driven by so-called "meme stocks" =E2=80=93 s=
tocks that were being actively promoted on social media platforms. Gu alleg=
edly then devised a scheme to take advantage of the "maker-taker" program o=
ffered by exchanges by trading options of these stocks with himself. ...</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The SEC's complaint alleges that Gu was able =
to generate illicit profits by using broker-dealer accounts that passed reb=
ates back to their customers to place initial orders on one side of the mar=
ket, and then using broker-dealer accounts that did not charge fees for tak=
ing liquidity for his subsequent orders on the other side of the market. Wh=
en identifying a product to trade, Gu and his friend and business associate=
, Yong Lee, selected far out-of-the-money put options on some "meme stocks,=
" which they thought would be easier to trade against themselves because in=
terest in buying the "meme stocks" and related price increases would make p=
ut options on those stocks less attractive. ... The complaint alleges that =
Gu executed approximately 11,400 trades with himself, netting at least $668=
,671 in liquidity-rebates, and that Lee executed approximately 2,300 trades=
 with himself, netting $51,334 in liquidity-rebates. In addition to collect=
ing these ill-gotten rebates, the wash trading scheme allegedly impacted th=
e market as it skewed the volume in certain option contracts and induced ot=
her traders to place trades in otherwise illiquid option contracts.</p></bl=
ockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The point of doing this in meme stock=
s is, paradoxically, to=C2=A0<em>avoid=C2=A0</em>trading with anyone else, =
because this scheme only works if you can be sure of only trading against y=
ourself. If everyone is buying a meme stock and its price is shooting up, n=
obody is buying far-out-of-the-money put options to bet against=C2=A0the st=
ock. So:</p><blockquote><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">On March 4, 2021, Gu w=
ash traded put options on Rocket Companies, Inc. (Ticker: RKT) with a $5 st=
rike price and an expiration of June 18, 2021 to obtain rebates. On March 4=
, 2021, RKT closed the trading day at $26.86 per share.</p></blockquote><p =
style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Gu allegedly traded 1,000 $5-strike=C2=A0put opti=
ons on Rocket that day, representing 100,000 shares (worth $500,000 at the =
put=E2=80=99s strike price, or around $2.7 million at the market price that=
 day). He made $430. Overall, they allegedly did about 13,790 trades for ab=
out 3.3 million contracts (about 330 million shares) over about two months,=
 making about $720,000 in profits after paying commissions. Also occasional=
ly they ended up trading options with other, real people. It seems like a l=
ot of work and risk. Anyway Lee settled and agreed to pay back his $51,334 =
plus a $25,000 fine; Gu has not settled.</p><table class=3D"header" width=
