He helped me on an extensive series of issues around my VoIP setup, and
stayed friendly even when I needed to rant about my lack of cell coverage /
the limits of local LAN NATing. He solved my problem quickly,
professionally, and completely even when my connection kept dropping and I
had to rejoin the chat repeatedly.

Having "enjoyed" subpar customer service plenty, I can confidently say that
competent  help like this is hard to find and he made a very favorable
impression. Just wanted to pass on the kudos!

All best,
Josh
