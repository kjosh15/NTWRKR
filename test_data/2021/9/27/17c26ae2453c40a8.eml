Of course!
Here are our numbers:
Pat: +1-212-749-1848
Mary: +1-917-698-0969
We're both on whatsapp, too, if that's easier.

We had, yet again, a minecraft frustration - in which the only tablet that
would connect with the world was Tom's, but apparently the minecraft on
Tom's functions in an inferior manner and chat doesn't work... I'm so glad
they were able to join - and am now deep into diving into why Colin's
tablet kept timing out on minecraft, when it seemed able to connect to
anything else.

Thanks again, and see you next week!
-P&M
