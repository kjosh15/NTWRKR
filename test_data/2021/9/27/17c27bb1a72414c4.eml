Fantastic news about Fund II; really interested to hear your posits on that
particular market!!

Reg. the CGM project, I've attached the overview deck. The interest in
Iceland is given it's meteoric rise in diabetes, fast-follower culture,
high medical adherence, and strong genetic data store.

TL;DR: A scaled Bayesian filtering process* can isolate the most effective
UX for behavior change... rather than starting with the data and trying to
convince the consumer to care about it directly. Success would mean an
instant new market for an existing product to improve health outcomes for
heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, as well as a new methodology for
quickly isolating effective new product designs pre-market.

Let me know if that makes any sense!

All best,
Josh

* Using the different data types presented through different interface
designs in different timescales in different orders.
