What?

Here is an incredible story about Ozy
<https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/25160991.311362/aHR0cHM6Ly93=
d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS9venktbWVkaWEtZ29sZG1=
hbi1zYWNocy5odG1s/61503b55d817ff15ef6da354B0d843f85>,
a digital media startup. Ozy was looking to raise a $40 million investment
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.=E2=80=99s asset management arm, on the streng=
th of
the traffic to its website, newsletters and YouTube videos. As part of its
due diligence, Goldman wanted to do a call with YouTube. Carlos Watson, the
=E2=80=9Ccharismatic chief executive=E2=80=9D of Ozy, gave Goldman a Gmail =
address for
YouTube executive Alex Piper, and Ozy set up a call between Piper and
Goldman in early February.

On the call, Piper said nice things about Ozy, but =E2=80=9Cthe man=E2=80=
=99s voice began
to sound strange to the Goldman Sachs team, as though it might have been
digitally altered.=E2=80=9D So Goldman =E2=80=9Creached out to Mr. Piper, n=
ot through the
Gmail address that Mr. Watson had provided before the meeting, but through
Mr. Piper=E2=80=99s assistant at YouTube.=E2=80=9D And it turned out he had=
 not been on the
call: Samir Rao, Ozy=E2=80=99s co-founder and chief operating officer, had
allegedly been impersonating him in order to trick Goldman into investing
in Ozy.[1]

Ordinarily if I were telling you this story I=E2=80=99d be quoting from a f=
ederal
criminal complaint, or at least a Securities and Exchange Commission
enforcement action, but nope everything is fine! I=E2=80=99m quoting from a=
 New
York Times column by Ben Smith, nobody has been charged with anything, and
Watson and Rao remain at Ozy and keep raising money. (Not from Goldman,
which passed on the deal, but =E2=80=9Cin April, two months after Goldman S=
achs
walked away, the company raised another round of financing.=E2=80=9D) Smith=
 writes:

In his apology to Goldman Sachs and in an email to me on Friday, Mr. Watson
attributed the incident to a mental health crisis and shared what he said
were details of Mr. Rao=E2=80=99s diagnosis.

=E2=80=9CSamir is a valued colleague and a close friend,=E2=80=9D Mr. Watso=
n said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m
proud that we stood by him while he struggled, and we=E2=80=99re all glad t=
o see
him now thriving again.=E2=80=9D

He added that Mr. Rao took time off from work after the call and is now
back at Ozy. Mr. Rao did not reply to requests for comment.

Marc Lasry, a hedge fund manager, a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks
basketball team and chairman of the Ozy board, said in a statement: =E2=80=
=9CThe
board was made aware of the incident, and we fully support the way it was
handled. The incident was an unfortunate one-time event, and Carlos and his
team showed the kind of compassion we would all want if any of us faced a
difficult situation in our own lives.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=A6

Goldman Sachs took no further action after the call with the Ozy executive
who had apparently impersonated the YouTube executive. But the security
team at Google, which owns YouTube, determined a crime might have been
committed.

Google has alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two people with
knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs then received an inquiry from
federal law enforcement officials, one person with knowledge of that
inquiry said.

The guy *impersonated a YouTube executive to trick someone into
investing? *You=E2=80=99re
just not going to get an easier securities fraud case than that, and
neither =E2=80=9Cit didn=E2=80=99t work=E2=80=9D nor =E2=80=9Che was having=
 a tough time=E2=80=9D nor =E2=80=9Cit only
happened once=E2=80=9D are generally defenses to fraud charges! Ozy=E2=80=
=99s board =E2=80=9Cdid
not formally investigate=E2=80=9D! The CEO of the company gave a potential =
investor
a fake email address for a big customer, and then the COO digitally altered
his voice to impersonate that customer on a call with the investor, and the
board decided not to investigate because ... they were satisfied that this
was just a one-time thing, a little oopsie, everything else that the
company does is completely aboveboard, and anyway no harm no foul?

Here=E2=80=99s the thing

about being a private company. You can sort of =E2=80=A6 say stuff. If you =
are a
public company and you say =E2=80=9Cwe have the highest traffic of any medi=
a site
in the world,=E2=80=9D and it=E2=80=99s not true, someone will sue you for =
securities
fraud. Everything you say in public, you say to investors, and if it=E2=80=
=99s
wrong you get in trouble. If you are a private company and you say =E2=80=
=9Cwe have
the highest traffic of any media site in the world,=E2=80=9D there can be v=
arious
footnotes and caveats that you think but don=E2=80=99t say, you can cross y=
our
fingers behind your back, it=E2=80=99s fine. You don=E2=80=99t have to foll=
ow generally
accepted accounting principles or use words in their ordinary meanings in
your public statements.[2] The public can=E2=80=99t buy your stock so it do=
esn=E2=80=99t
matter. You sell stock only occasionally, in negotiated transactions with
sophisticated investors; you sign agreements with those investors in which
they essentially disclaim any reliance on anything that you=E2=80=99ve said=
 outside
of the deal documents.

But! When those sophisticated investors do their due diligence, they will
ask you specific questions. You will say in public =E2=80=9Cwe have the hig=
hest
traffic of any media site in the world,=E2=80=9D and the investors will sen=
d you a
list of questions like =E2=80=9Chow many unique visitors did you have in ea=
ch of
the last 12 months=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cdescribe all commercial arrangemen=
ts in which you
pay for traffic=E2=80=9D and other stuff designed to tease out exactly how =
big and
good your traffic is. They will do this because they are sophisticated
investors; they understand that your public statements are for different
audiences, and that in any case you are a visionary private-company founder

and when you say stuff it sometimes reflects your confidence in your
company=E2=80=99s bright future rather than present-day reality. So they wi=
ll just
quietly, behind the scenes, ask you boring factual questions to see how
close your claims are to reality. And you will respond with the boring
factual answers. And if those answers don=E2=80=99t quite correspond to you=

claims then, you know, that=E2=80=99s fine, that=E2=80=99s how startups wor=

they won=E2=80=99t necessarily pass on the investment just because the bori=
ng
financial reality of your business doesn=E2=80=99t yet match your vision.

It=E2=80=99s just that *if you lie to them in due diligence that ruins the =
whole
deal*. If they ask for a customer call during due diligence, and you
impersonate the customer to give them the answers you want them to hear,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

Here=E2=80=99s another thing about being a private company. What if this ha=
d
worked? What if Goldman hadn=E2=80=99t noticed anything unusual and had cou=
ghed up
the $40 million? Wouldn=E2=80=99t Goldman have been embarrassed when this s=
tory
came out? Well, no, because this story never would have come out! Even if
someone had told Goldman after the fact =E2=80=9Chey that call with YouTube=
 was
fake,=E2=80=9D what would they have done about it? They could call Ozy and =
demand
their money back but presumably Ozy spent it. They could sue, but how much
would they be able to recover? Once you=E2=80=99ve been *tricked *into inve=
sting in
a high-flying startup, the only rational move is to hope that they succeed,
clean up their act and go public at a higher valuation. You=E2=80=99d never=
 go
around saying =E2=80=9Cwe were tricked=E2=80=9D; that just destroys value.

Similarly, if you are an investor and board member of a hot startup, and
you find out that the co-founder impersonated a customer to try to trick
someone into investing, what are your incentives? If you make a big deal
about it and throw around words like =E2=80=9Cfraud,=E2=80=9D it will be ha=
rd for the
startup ever to raise money again, which might make your own investment
worthless. If you say, meh, unfortunate one-time event, no harm no foul,
then maybe the company=E2=80=99s vision will end up working out and you=E2=
=80=99ll be able
to sell at a profit. If you invest in a startup you are buying an option;
your goal, as a board member, is not to extinguish the option value too
soon. Just, you know, let it ride, see where this goes.

I am appalled, sure, but honestly I also admire it a bit. I feel like there
is some threshold of absolute shamelessness that most companies cannot even
aspire to, but if you reach it then either you blow up in short order or
you take over the world. I=E2=80=99ll probably be working for Ozy in a year=
.

Mind Your Own Business Act

The way corporate law generally works in the U.S. is:

   1. Corporate law is a matter of *state *law. Securities law is federal
   =E2=80=94 if companies lie about their securities to raise money they ge=
t in
   federal trouble =E2=80=94 but *corporate *law, and in particular the fid=
uciary
   duties of directors to shareholders, is state law. Delaware law, mostly,
   because big U.S. public companies are mostly incorporated in Delaware, a=
nd
   Delaware has specialized judges who are good at business law.
   2. Corporate law is generally deferential to directors. If the directors
   make a decision on behalf of the company, and a shareholder disagrees, a=
nd
   the shareholder comes to a Delaware court saying =E2=80=9Cthis company i=
ntroduced a
   big new smartphone but I think that a smaller phone would fit in my
   hands better,=E2=80=9D the court will not be interested. The =E2=80=9Cbu=
siness judgment
   rule=E2=80=9D generally requires courts to defer to directors=E2=80=99 b=
usiness decisions.
   There are exceptions where a court will scrutinize directors=E2=80=99 de=
cisions
   more closely, but generally that requires the shareholder to prove some
   conflict of interest, some personal interest of the director that makes =
it
   impossible for her to be loyal to shareholders.

What if we reversed that? What if we made corporate law federal, and
required courts to reverse directors=E2=80=99 business decisions unless the
*directors *could *prove *that they were the correct decisions? You don=E2=
=80=99t
like the size of the new iPhone, you sue Apple Inc. in federal court
anywhere in the U.S., and then the burden is on Apple to prove to a jury
that the new iPhone is the right size. If the jury disagrees then the
directors are personally liable for damages. Would this be a good system?

No, come on, that is the dumbest paragraph I have typed in 10 years of
typing paragraphs about business, but here we are, here we are, here we are

:

U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Mind Your Own Business Act,
which would enable shareholders to hold woke corporations accountable.
Specifically, the legislation would require corporate directors to prove
their =E2=80=9Cwoke=E2=80=9D corporate actions were in their shareholders=
=E2=80=99 best interest in
order to avoid liability for breach of fiduciary duty in shareholder
litigation over corporate actions relating to certain social policies. It
would also incentivize corporate management to stop abusing their positions
to advance left-wing social policies by increasing their personal liability
to shareholders for breaches of fiduciary duty resulting from those
policies. Rubio announced the bill during an appearance with Maria
Bartiromo on Mornings with Maria and in a Fox Business op-ed. =E2=80=A6

=E2=80=9CNo more legal tricks that shield these corporate executives from
accountability,=E2=80=9D Rubio continued. =E2=80=9CIf they really believe t=
hat being woke
is good for business, they should have to say so=E2=80=94and prove it=E2=80=
=94under oath in
court.=E2=80=9D

Rubio=E2=80=99s Mind Your Own Business Act is a private-sector solution to =
the
problem of woke corporations. Specifically the bill:

Requires large public companies listing on national stock exchanges to
provide shareholders with significant holdings with certain privileges with
respect to claims for breach of fiduciary duty under covered circumstances.

Covered circumstances include if a company takes an action on a primarily
non-pecuniary basis in response to State law, boycotts a class of persons
or industry on a primarily non-pecuniary basis, or uses primarily
non-pecuniary public reasoning for an action.

Corporate defendants would be bound by presumptions that pecuniary interest
does not include common defenses used to defend exercises of business
judgment, including the media image of the company or employee morale.

Ensures that for claims of breach of fiduciary duty against management
brought by shareholders under these covered circumstances, management would
have the burden of proof and, if found in breach of their duties, be liable
without indemnification by the company for a minimum amount of damages and
attorney=E2=80=99s fees.

Here is the text of his proposed bill
<https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/25160991.311362/aHR0cHM6Ly93=

which is vastly sillier even than my summary, or his. It allows
shareholders to sue specifically for decisions involving a =E2=80=9Ccovered
divisive concept,=E2=80=9D it somehow plans to federalize corporate law thr=
ough
stock-exchange listings requirements that would require corporate charter
amendments to specify burdens of proof and treble damages for these
lawsuits, and it specifically presumes that it cannot be reasonable for a
company to care about employee retention, public relations or marketing.
=E2=80=9CWe bought ads on television to sell shoes,=E2=80=9D a shoe company=

Marco Rubio would say =E2=80=9Caha, that is not in your pecuniary interests=

that someone got on the proxy statement at Fox Corp., asking Fox to become
a public benefit corporation, and =E2=80=9Cthat one of the public benefits =
included
in the amendment be provision of the Company=E2=80=99s viewers with an accu=
rate
understanding of current events through the exercise of journalistic
integrity.=E2=80=9D The idea is that a regular corporation has fiduciary du=
ties
only to its shareholders, and tends to maximize profits, while a public
benefit corporation has to =E2=80=9Cbalance the interests of shareholders,
stakeholders, and those public benefits identified in the Company=E2=80=99s
certificate of incorporation, allowing the corporation to protect
communities, even when doing so does not optimize financial return.=E2=80=
=9D The
shareholder proposing this, in other words, wants Fox to have a
corporate fiduciary duty to journalistic accuracy, even when it=E2=80=99s n=
ot
profitable.

This is, to be clear, pure trolling; Rupert Murdoch owns 41% of the voting

of Fox, the board opposes the proposal (=E2=80=9CWe are purveyors of First
Amendment activities,=E2=80=9D it says), it won=E2=80=99t go anywhere, and =
even if it won a
majority of votes it is non-binding. Nothing will come of this.

Still I wanted to quote these paragraphs in the case for the shareholder
proposal:

Misinformation can put democracy at risk, threaten public interest in the
environment, and undermine public health. These threats could be
prioritized at a PBC, even if doing so sacrificed financial return.

The vast majority of our diversified shareholders lose when companies harm
the economy, because the value of diversified portfolios rises and falls
with GDP. While a concentrated holder may profit when the Company inflicts
costs on society by emphasizing viewership over accuracy, diversified
shareholders internalize those costs.

I don=E2=80=99t think that anyone could have written those paragraphs a dec=
ade ago.
The argument here is that (1) most of Fox=E2=80=99s shareholders are divers=
ified
(other than Murdoch of course), (2) diversified shareholders, in some
sense, own the entire world, and (3) if a company=E2=80=99s activities are =
bad for

Five investment giants -- BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
Lord, Abbett & Co., Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Vanguard Group
Inc. -- are working with two minority-owned underwriters, Loop Capital
Markets and Siebert Williams Shank & Co., to develop and distribute a
questionnaire that governments will be asked to fill out before new bond
deals are arranged. It will ask about policing policies, efforts to combat
race-based inequality, social services and the demographic breakdown of the
government=E2=80=99s workforce, among other things. =E2=80=A6

The firms aren=E2=80=99t bound to use the information in their investment
decisions, nor will the underwriters require governments to participate.
Yet backers said the involvement of such massive investment companies gives
the project significant heft and lets governments know that social concerns
are beginning to matter to buyers of their bonds.

=E2=80=9CThese are among the largest municipal bond holders; they are mammo=
th
institutions that can impact pricing levels on municipal bonds and their
position is that we need this information,=E2=80=9D said Suzanne Shank, chi=

demanding this, we want to make our issuer clients aware that this is
something that will be increasingly scrutinized.=E2=80=9D

Look, if the government doesn=E2=80=99t like certain big investors=E2=80=99=
 views on social
matters, it can go around threatening them with changes to fiduciary law
and treble damages and shifting burdens of proof. If the big investors
don=E2=80=99t like certain governments=E2=80=99 views on social matters, th=
ey can go around
threatening them with, well, questionnaires mainly, but also with an
implicit threat of not giving them any more money. The governments make the
laws, but the investors have the money.
Wash trading

The way a lot of U.S. market structure works is that an exchange will pay
traders to create liquidity (by posting bids and offers on the exchange),
and will charge traders for taking liquidity (by sending market orders that
execute against those posted bids and offers). This creates incentives for
traders to post orders on exchanges, which makes those exchanges better
places to trade: If you want to buy a stock on the exchange, you can do so
instantly, because the exchange is paying people to provide liquidity (and
charging you for it). This is sometimes called =E2=80=9Cmaker-taker=E2=80=
=9D pricing and is
controversial for various reasons but never mind that.

Here for instance is how one options exchange works
<https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/25160991.311362/aHR0cHM6Ly93=
d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9saXRpZ2F0aW9uL2NvbXBsYWludHMvMjAyMS9jb21wLXByMjAyMS0xOTUucGR=
m/61503b55d817ff15ef6da354B10d0d1a5>
:

At all times relevant to this Complaint, Exchange A charged a take fee of
50 cents per contract and, at the highest volume tier, paid a make rebate
of 53 cents per contract. Exchange A paid the 3 cents difference itself to
incentivize liquidity on the exchange.

An options contract is generally for 100 shares. So you can make about half
a penny per share by providing liquidity in this contract.

These fees are generally paid to brokerage firms that send the orders to
the exchange. Some brokerage firms pass them on to customers: If you send a
liquidity-creating order, the brokerage gets 53 cents and passes most of it
to you (for instance it gives you 43 cents and keeps 10); if you send a
liquidity-taking order, the broker pays 50 cents and charges you for it.
Other brokerages do not; they keep the make fees for themselves and pay the
take fees themselves.

One thing you could do is trade options back and forth with yourself using
two different brokers, one of which does pass on the maker-taker fees and
one of which doesn=E2=80=99t. You send non-marketable limit orders to one b=
roker
who passes on the fees, you send offsetting market orders through another
broker who doesn=E2=80=99t, your one order trades with your other order, yo=
u get
paid a maker fee for providing liquidity to yourself and you don=E2=80=99t =
get
charged a taker fee for taking liquidity from yourself. Since you=E2=80=99r=
e
trading with yourself you have no market risk; you=E2=80=99re just collecti=
ng the
43 cents per contract.

You should not do this for several reasons. One, it=E2=80=99s illegal; trad=
ing with
yourself is called =E2=80=9Cwash trading=E2=80=9D and is not allowed. Two, =
the brokers
don=E2=80=99t want you to do this, and you will need to engage in some subt=
erfuge
to get them to approve your accounts. Three, it is risky: If someone
*else *sends
in an order while you are doing this, you might trade with them instead of
yourself, and then you=E2=80=99ll have market risk; you=E2=80=99ll be on th=
e hook for
whatever options you are buying or selling. Four, we are talking about 43
cents per contract. If you trade 100 options contracts, representing 10,000
shares of stock, you will make $43 doing this, before your commissions and
other costs. You need to do this in huge size to make any money, it seems
time-consuming and tedious, and if any of your hundreds of orders trade
with a real person rather than with yourself it=E2=80=99s very risky.

Here is a fun Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action

:

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Florida resident and
his friend for engaging in a fraudulent scheme designed to collect
liquidity rebates from exchanges by wash trading put options of certain
"meme stocks" in early 2021.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey, starting in late February 2021, Suyun Gu
became aware of the increased market volume and volatility driven by
so-called "meme stocks" =E2=80=93 stocks that were being actively promoted =
on
social media platforms. Gu allegedly then devised a scheme to take
advantage of the "maker-taker" program offered by exchanges by trading
options of these stocks with himself. ...

The SEC's complaint alleges that Gu was able to generate illicit profits by
using broker-dealer accounts that passed rebates back to their customers to
place initial orders on one side of the market, and then using
broker-dealer accounts that did not charge fees for taking liquidity for
his subsequent orders on the other side of the market. When identifying a
product to trade, Gu and his friend and business associate, Yong Lee,
selected far out-of-the-money put options on some "meme stocks," which they
thought would be easier to trade against themselves because interest in
buying the "meme stocks" and related price increases would make put options
on those stocks less attractive. ... The complaint alleges that Gu executed
approximately 11,400 trades with himself, netting at least $668,671 in
liquidity-rebates, and that Lee executed approximately 2,300 trades with
himself, netting $51,334 in liquidity-rebates. In addition to collecting
these ill-gotten rebates, the wash trading scheme allegedly impacted the
market as it skewed the volume in certain option contracts and induced
other traders to place trades in otherwise illiquid option contracts.

The point of doing this in meme stocks is, paradoxically, to *avoid *tradin=
g
with anyone else, because this scheme only works if you can be sure of only
trading against yourself. If everyone is buying a meme stock and its price
is shooting up, nobody is buying far-out-of-the-money put options to bet
against the stock. So:

On March 4, 2021, Gu wash traded put options on Rocket Companies, Inc.
(Ticker: RKT) with a $5 strike price and an expiration of June 18, 2021 to
obtain rebates. On March 4, 2021, RKT closed the trading day at $26.86 per
share.

Gu allegedly traded 1,000 $5-strike put options on Rocket that day,
representing 100,000 shares (worth $500,000 at the put=E2=80=99s strike pri=
ce, or
around $2.7 million at the market price that day). He made $430. Overall,
they allegedly did about 13,790 trades for about 3.3 million contracts
(about 330 million shares) over about two months, making about $720,000 in
profits after paying commissions. Also occasionally they ended up trading
options with other, real people. It seems like a lot of work and risk.
Anyway Lee settled and agreed to pay back his $51,334 plus a $25,000 fine;
Gu has not settled.

At times, options trading has dwarfed activity in stocks, creating leverage
that traders and analysts say stands to accentuate both up and down moves
in the market.

Nine of 10 of the most-active call-options trading days in history have
taken place in 2021, Cboe Global Markets data show. Almost 39 million
option contracts have changed hands on an average day this year, up 31%
from 2020 and the highest level since the market=E2=80=99s inception in 197=
3,
according to figures from the Options Clearing Corp.

Though much of this trading is being done by Wall Street firms that work
behind the scenes, individuals=E2=80=99 increasing embrace of risky options=

has risen roughly fourfold over the past five years, according to Cboe data=

Ranjan Roy=E2=80=99s theory that a change in Reddit=E2=80=99s user-engageme=

helped spawn the modern meme-stock frenzy. I wrote:

From the dumb perspective of the Reddit algorithm that sends you those
notifications, this is what success looks like: It sent you those
notifications, and now everyone is on Reddit. It is a paperclip maximizer:
Its goal is to get more people to spend more time on Reddit, and the way it
does that is to cause global financial markets to be wildly volatile and
disconnected from fundamental value because it turns out =E2=80=94 who knew=
? =E2=80=94 that
that drives more engagement with Reddit. Nobody at Reddit sat down and said
=E2=80=9Chey we should pump up some weird stocks, that will maximize traffi=

lume and volatility driven by so-called &quot;meme stocks&quot; =E2=80=93 s=
tocks that were being actively promoted on social media platforms. Gu alleg=

tomers to place initial orders on one side of the market, and then using br=
oker-dealer accounts that did not charge fees for taking liquidity for his =
subsequent orders on the other side of the market. When identifying a produ=
ct to trade, Gu and his friend and business associate, Yong Lee, selected f=
ar out-of-the-money put options on some &quot;meme stocks,&quot; which they=
 thought would be easier to trade against themselves because interest in bu=
ying the &quot;meme stocks&quot; and related price increases would make put=
 options on those stocks less attractive. ... The complaint alleges that Gu=
 executed approximately 11,400 trades with himself, netting at least $668,6=
71 in liquidity-rebates, and that Lee executed approximately 2,300 trades w=
ith himself, netting $51,334 in liquidity-rebates. In addition to collectin=
g these ill-gotten rebates, the wash trading scheme allegedly impacted the =
market as it skewed the volume in certain option contracts and induced othe=
