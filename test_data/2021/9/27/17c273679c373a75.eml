Hey Kes!

Just checking in to see where things are. No pressure to respond if the
ball is still in play; I'll circle back in a couple weeks if I don't hear
back. Interesting developments on our side in the meanwhile around being
able to focus more narrowly on leadership teams + potential new regulatory
opportunities (ISQM).

All best,
Josh
