Bala,

I've been working on a CGM test protocol proposal and am speaking to some
senior executives at Novo Nordisk and J&J. I'd like to propose Iceland as a
potential test case and potentially partner with DeCode to run the
logistics. Do you have any contacts there?

Otherwise how are you? It's an interesting time in the investment
community! Let me know if I can be of any help.

All best,
Josh
