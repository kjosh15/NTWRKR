Many thanks for the time, Michael. Excited to see how much commonality we
shared, at least in identifying the problem spaces!

Fully agreed about charting an entirely new metric of the future of EX, and
love the framing. Next step is a practical one: what do we want to do in
order to test our hypotheses about same?

More soon,
Josh
