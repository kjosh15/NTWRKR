Thanks so much for the introduction, S=C3=B8ren.

Christian, Tony, I'd love to connect briefly if you have time and interest;
it's my position that a different orientation around CGM data could yield
big benefits. Let me know what your schedules allow over the next few weeks=
!

Sincerely,
Josh
