Hey, super interesting - congrats!!

I'm still on retainer to World 50 (who recently bought G100), and their
Innovation group is super active. I think we discussed it prior to the
pandemic starting, but would it be worth revisiting the idea of doing a
SXSW+W50 C-Suite Innovation event? Or is there some other way I can help
bring some of the senior executives (who are truly cross-market and
multinational) to the table for SXSW around startups and innovation?

All best,
Josh

div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"auto">These trends are on a col=

I=E2=80=99d like to give several case studies on how this has worked badly =

 ESG as KPI: activist investors, informed and motivated consumers, and extr=

: the pandemic disrupted supply chains, accelerated innovation initiatives,=
 and enabled a sea-change in consumer behavior. Organizations that were abl=
