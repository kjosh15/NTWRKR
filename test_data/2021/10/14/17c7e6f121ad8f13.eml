Pursuant to our earlier call, the below seems like a reasonable strategy to
explore IF we can get a client to pay us to do it. Sky might be a good fit;
there are clearly free tools we can use (I'll send you one Mike sent
recently in a moment) to create self-creating communities inside
organizations, and it lets us be assertive about creating a solution that
rests heavily on our statistics vs. consulting chops. It also gives us an
easy feeder for the video distribution/measurement functionality you've
helped build up!

What I'm sensing from our conversations and lack of momentum around sales
is that having a data-centric solution to the problems we identify is one
good way we can move forward. The other is through partnerships, which we
are exploring now (mostly with large agencies so far, but with smaller L&D
providers increasingly).

Let me know if you think that makes sense as a defining direction for us
going forward. When you asked "what are we doing" earlier today I realized
the answer was "everything." I'd like to get that fully clarified.
