Susan,

Thanks for a wide-ranging and very insightful call. I apologize for my
enthusiasm, but I don't often get such good questions to dig into!

As per our conversation I've attached my board resume - any advice
appreciated - as well as a brief overview deck on the culture analytics
platform <http://www.indigometrics.com> we've developed. If you know
someone inside KPMG who we could speak to about a partnership trial we'd
love to demonstrate how we can produce ongoing recurring engagement on
behalf of your clients. FWIW, the audits / regulatory space is of great
interest for this.

Finally, let me know more about your podcast, and if there's anything I can
do to be of help to you going forward please do let me know.

All best wishes from sunny Iceland,
Josh
