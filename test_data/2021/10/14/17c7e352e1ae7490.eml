This piece really spoke to my experience, and to some of my thinking around
what we want to provide for the boys:

"They=E2=80=99re also buying into this idea that kids have to be absolutely
optimized, maximized so they can get onto the narrow path that leads to a
stable upper-middle-class life, and otherwise it=E2=80=99s Starbucks until =
the end
of time."

Maybe that's not the best thing after all?
xoxo,
Josh
