*TL;DR: What's the best way to get from an advisory board position (in a
public company) to a supervisory one without public company executive
experience?*
A lot of my recent updates have been about Indigometrics; I still have
loads of questions there, but wanted to take this one to ask about another
element of my career plan.

I was recently invited to sit on some different advisory boards, at least
one of which is for a (very large) public company. These boards are all
focused on R&D and Innovation in which I am being asked to provide a strong
technology focus.

In the meantime, I'm building up Indigometrics as CEO in the hopes of
selling it - not taking it public.

So my question to you is around how to continue to accrue experience, build
a resume, and create a network that gets me from advisory boards to
supervisory ones. Normally this is done through executive experience, which
I will have at a small scale via a startup... But that is not the same as
serving as an executive to a public company. This is more art than science
from what I can tell; what do you advise?

All best wishes,
Josh
