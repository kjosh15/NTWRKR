I've got another question: how do I export all my data to data so I can run
my own in-house analytics? I know I can do an export campaign-by-campaign,
but I'm looking for a master dump of all of them together. Any advice?

Thanks!
Josh

Firstly, marking leads as lost and THEN unsubscribing them seems to be work=

Secondly, the app is timing out on me in trying to figure out what problems=

&gt; Hey Josh!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I created a quick video to show you how you can tell the difference. Y=
ou<br>
can check it out here.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you are seeing replies from a prospect and saw them get a campaign<=
br>
email after they replied, I&#39;d love to take a look at that specific<br>
instance. To do that, I&#39;d need the prospect&#39;s email along with:<br>
&gt; 1. Screenshot of the reply in your inbox (not in Mailshake) with both =
the<br>
To: and From addresses fully expanded<br>
&gt; 2. Message ID of the reply message - Not sure where to find? Check out=
<br>
these guides: Google full email headers or Microsoft find Email Header OR<b=
r>
reach out to your mail provider&#39;s support team so they can help grab th=
at<br>
Message ID for you.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you have multiple replies that aren&#39;t getting picked up 2-3 rec=
ipient<br>
examples would be helpful so we can investigate.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Once we have that information, we&#39;ll be able to investigate and pi=
npoint<br>
what might be the cause of the reply not getting picked up. Thank you so<br=

much for your help with this!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Josh,<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; When someone becomes a Lead (meaning they show up in your Lead=

all follow up and on click messages you have set up in your campaign will<b=

like you have it set up to mark them as a lead when they reply. Once they<b=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The email address of a prospect who unsubscrib=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Also, contacts that responded, and I ma=
