This is AMAZING. Such a useful framework, and a HUGE leap forward in my
context for trauma. Really think we should talk this through so we can make
it part of our parenting - I've already been purposefully framing hard work
and suffering as a necessary and rich part of life for the kids, but this
really puts it in context.

Let's talk!

xoxo,
Josh
