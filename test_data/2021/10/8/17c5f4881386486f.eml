Not sure where you're at in terms of partnerships, but I recently spoke to
the CEO of RetinaRisk, a startup that began with an app to diagnose
diabetic retinopathy, and are now developing an API for doing automated
diagnostic testing of baseline clinical data - enabling at-the-door
early-stage diagnosis, for example.

Let me know if you'd like n intro, and/or if this is actually spam - so I
don't send you anything else like this!!

All best,
Josh
