Are you all down for a sharks in space, or shall we skip a week due to the
holiday?

Either way, Othinn was wondering if Colin wanted to try some other games.
Not sure where you stand on the topic and would be curious to hear - we=E2=
=80=99ve
generally tried to keep them constrained to more educationally oriented
games (Minecraft is as far out as we=E2=80=99ve gotten so far) but that won=
=E2=80=99t last

Let us know what you think, and happy holidays!!
