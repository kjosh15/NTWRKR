The box wasn't designed or tested for use with a continuous 360 degree
servo; if that=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re using we wouldn't know what to=
 expect.

Best to use a 180 degree servo. Either the exact one we recommend or a
Futaba 3003 or 3004 if you want to buy a more reliable servo than what we
are seeing in the recent crop of MG995 servos=E2=80=A6 which based on what =
other
folks have said on this list seem increasingly problematic!
