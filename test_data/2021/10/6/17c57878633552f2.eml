Just found out that Motorola is going to pass on our platform in favor of a
resource you=E2=80=99re already using internally.

I just wanted to say thanks - you were extremely patient with my
remorseless followup and a huge help in getting us into the right
conversations. If I can ever be of help to you please let me know - I owe
you one!

All best wishes,
Josh
