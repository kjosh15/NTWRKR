It=E2=80=99s only an additional $100 to file for FBARs, meaning we can have=
 more
than $10k in our non-us accounts.

The reason that matters is a) we don=E2=80=99t have to worry as much about =
your
student loans, b) we can use an Icelandic CC and keep enough in our
Icelandic accounts to keep it paid off, and c) we can pay ourselves a
regular salary and not have to constantly juggle to keep our accounts below
a threshold.

The only question I have remaining is if we can pay the Icelandic CC
directly from our US personal account. If so, managing our finances will be
fundamentally the same - we=E2=80=99ll accept payments into H4X, move 50% i=
nto the
tax savings account + 25% into the emergency fund (until we can pay off the
0% card from there), and the last 25% into the personal checking account.
That account can then pay our personal CC directly along with monthly
transfers for salary.

This way we can track all our personal spending more effectively using the
arionbanki tool, and all the business expenses will stay in the US (along
with any profits, which we can move into IRAs pre-tax).

If the above works for you, I=E2=80=99ll find out if we can pay the Iceland=
ic cc
directly from our US account and submit an application.

Xoxo,
Josh
