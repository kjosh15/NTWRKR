Heard back and they're already scheduled out through 2022 - looks like they
had a lot of commitments from 2020/2021 that are holding over. They *are*
interested in 2023, however. I'll circle back and bother you about it as we
get closer. ;)

Let me know if I can be of any help otherwise, however - you're in a pretty
sweet spot in terms of the work in front of you!!

All best,
Josh

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For March 2021 I=E2=80=99d suggest:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> - Data-led culture: distributed workforces, faster
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> innovation cycles, and reconfigured supply chains are a=
ll putting
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> significant pressure on data to drive value from corpor=
ate assets. But at
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> the same time, the Great Resignation is putting massive=
 new pressure on
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> employers to produce equity in the workforce.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> These trends are on a collision course as data is being
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> collected - and used - at a breakneck pace. I=E2=80=99d=
 like to give several case
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> studies on how this has worked badly (in terms of priva=
cy, churn, conduct
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> risk, and PR) as well as how organizations can approach=
 their rich new data
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ecosystem to create cumulative, agile, human-centric va=
lue.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> - ESG as KPI: activist investors, informed and motivate=
d
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> consumers, and extremely dynamic market conditions are =
shifting how
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> companies measure and create value in some big ways - b=
ut so far we=E2=80=99ve only
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> seen the tip of the iceberg. Come hear  how ESG is a le=
ns not only for your
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PR and Reporting strategies, but also your Innovation a=
nd Technology plans.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> - The Permeable Organization: the pandemic disrupted
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> supply chains, accelerated innovation initiatives, and =
enabled a sea-change
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> in consumer behavior. Organizations that were able to q=
uickly integrate

d M&A have been fast

 The more an

 from corporate assets. But at the same time, the Great Resignation is putt=
ing massive new pressure on employers to produce equity in the workforce.</=
div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"auto">These trends are on a col=
lision course as data is being collected - and used - at a breakneck pace. =
I=E2=80=99d like to give several case studies on how this has worked badly =
(in terms of privacy, churn, conduct risk, and PR) as well as how organizat=
ions can approach their rich new data ecosystem to create cumulative, agile=
, human-centric value.</div><div dir=3D"auto"><br></div><div dir=3D"auto">-=
 ESG as KPI: activist investors, informed and motivated consumers, and extr=
emely dynamic market conditions are shifting how companies measure and crea=
te value in some big ways - but so far we=E2=80=99ve only seen the tip of t=
he iceberg. Come hear =C2=A0how ESG is a lens not only for your PR and Repo=

: the pandemic disrupted supply chains, accelerated innovation initiatives,=
 and enabled a sea-change in consumer behavior. Organizations that were abl=
e to quickly integrate outside assets through licensing, partnerships, JVs,=
 and M&amp;A have been fast outpacing their competitors and will continue t=
o do so. The more an organization can enable this free-flow of capacity int=
o and out of their structures the better they are able to take advantage of=
 the new dynamism markets now demand, but this is no easy feat. Come learn =
