Hi Josh, good timing! I was just speaking to one of my new colleagues about
you today.

"new" because we have been restructuring our team as we build it back up
post-2020 circumstances with some new hires and some role shuffles.

So, shortly I will be introducing you to the new person on our team
(Michele LoDuca) who is overseeing our Tech Industry track of programming.

I have spoken to her about the ideas you entered into PanelPicker and she
would love to chat with you to gain more context on what you are thinking.

In terms of the evaluator role, I can now confirm that we need to wait
until next season due to the process being 95% over at this point. Reach
out to me in April and let's get you into that group of folks.

Thanks for being on top of this! Really appreciate it as I manage the
masses while we build back up. Hope you and your family are doing well!!
