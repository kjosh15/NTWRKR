"Sometimes I forget that I=E2=80=99ve aged ...."
----------------------------------------

The headline above is the first line of 52-year-old Dave Grohl's
unconventional new memoir, The Storyteller: Tales of Life and
Music (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/3ohphduq3z9wo4ip/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNCQzVtSW4=3D
).

Here's the full first paragraph:

Sometimes I forget that I=E2=80=99ve aged. My head and my heart seem to
play this cruel trick on me, deceiving me with the false illusion
of youth by greeting the world every day through the idealistic,
mischievous eyes of a rebellious child finding happiness and
appreciation in the most basic, simple things.

Growl was one-third of the band that gave us our generation's
anthem (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/n2hohqunvr5d8ri0/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1oVFdLYmZvaWtlZw=3D=3D
). And it seems he stepped into the role of the voice of a
generation when his friend and band mate tragically departed in
1994.

Props to Grohl for actually writing the book himself, quite well
given he was a high school dropout and self-described "terrible
student." Contrast that with rock memoirs that come into
existence thanks to, in Grohl's own words, "4 hours of
interviews, find someone else to write it, put your face on the
cover, and voila!"

Dave began playing guitar at age 10, and discovered he could
learn music by ear. But it was his first punk rock show (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/48hvh7u0mgqo5kfq/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ210b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbGxpbm9pcy9kYXZlLWdyb2hsLXdyb3RlLWEtb=
WVtb2lyLXRoZS1zdG9yeXRlbGxlci1oZS1zYXlzLWhpcy1saWZlLWluLXJvY2stbi1yb2xsL2Fy=
dGljbGVfZmFiZDRiOGMtMjdhNS0xMWVjLWFiYTItN2IwZWJkZDRhZWU0Lmh0bWw=3D
) during a visit to Chicago that convinced the kid that he too
could be in a band.

Up until Foo Fighters, Dave was defined by punk rock. And even
though his current music is best characterized as "Dad rock," you
won't hear him trying to hang on (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/wnh2h6urqgvz5mul/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cud2J1ci5vcmcvaGVyZWFuZG5vdy8yMDIxLzEwLzA3L2RhdmUtZ3JvaGwtdGhlL=
XN0b3J5dGVsbGVy
) to some form of hipster cred.

=E2=80=9CI'm the earnest, sort of eager rock =E2=80=99n=E2=80=99 roll dude =
who like is
annoyingly happy, and I've taken the danger out of rock and
roll,=E2=80=9D he says. =E2=80=9CBut there's a part of me that's like, do y=
ou
want me to put it back in? Because I've seen what it'll do.=E2=80=9D

Copy that, loud and clear. I don't think we need any more
darkness given the lead singers of Dave's specific era we've
lost. Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, Scott Weiland, Chris Cornell,
Chester Bennington ... all tragically foreshadowed by the 1990
death of Andrew Wood from Mother Love Bone, the band that became
Pearl Jam.

Of course, Storyteller has to deal with Cobain's untimely
passing. And you can tell it still hurts.

Grohl begins the chapter about Cobain=E2=80=99s suicide -- the most
difficult part of the book to write -- with the words, "He=E2=80=99s
gone, Dave."

What The Storyteller ultimately reveals is in many ways what we
already know. Dave is a genuinely good guy who views his journey
with an awe and sense of gratitude that's invigorating. He's the
happily married father of three who just happens to be the lead
singer of a band that's won Best Rock Album at the Grammys
multiple times.

And oh yeah ... the drummer from Nirvana. The cool thing is he's
still obsessed with music just as he was when relentlessly
strumming that guitar at age 10.

One reviewer called him (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/48hvh7u0mgqo5kfq/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ210b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbGxpbm9pcy9kYXZlLWdyb2hsLXdyb3RlLWEtb=
WVtb2lyLXRoZS1zdG9yeXRlbGxlci1oZS1zYXlzLWhpcy1saWZlLWluLXJvY2stbi1yb2xsL2Fy=
dGljbGVfZmFiZDRiOGMtMjdhNS0xMWVjLWFiYTItN2IwZWJkZDRhZWU0Lmh0bWw=3D
) "rock=E2=80=99s Tom Hanks." Everyone likes Dave, and if you run across
someone who doesn't, well ... run. But would the more cynical
Kurt Cobain approve of where Grohl has ended up? Dave thinks so.

"He's always smiling in my dreams," Grohl says. "So I take that
as a good sign."

Storyteller is a great read because it's incredibly refreshing
that perhaps the most prominent Gen Xer around is genuinely
excited to continue to create and have fun. Beyond that, though,
I think there's something to "forgetting that we've aged." We've
done what we were "supposed to do" as adults, but what now?

What would it take to wake up each day with the earnest obsession
of a 10-year-old you?

What would that look like specifically?

What's standing in your way?

The author of this piece recently stumbled into an evening

manageable simmer. Like anything else in the world of mental and
emotional health, it's not a panacea. But it is effective, at
least for him.

superiority complex.

).=E2=80=9D

Of course, it doesn=E2=80=99t take an impending apocalypse to trigger an
anxiety disorder. The Anxiety and Depression Association of
America reports 40 million American adults (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/6qhehouplo6q5wc9/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9hZGFhLm9yZy91bmRlcnN0YW5kaW5nLWFueGlldHkvZmFjdHMtc3RhdGlzdGljcw=3D=

) are affected by this common mental illness. And while it=E2=80=99s
highly treatable, less than 37% seek help.

I=E2=80=99m one of those people who=E2=80=99s grappled with anxiety (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75un8r7wz3i8hn92pxbz/kkhmh2u8nm2752ik/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC91c2UtYW54aWV0eS8=3D

R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9iZXN0LW1lZGl0YXRpb24tcHJhY3RpY2Uv
) is one of the best ways to beat stress.

I=E2=80=99m also a writer, so I choose my words carefully =E2=80=94 notice =
I said
stress. To combat anxiety effectively, you=E2=80=99ll likely also need
some =E2=80=9Ceyes-open=E2=80=9D weapons to slay that beast.

Stress vs. Anxiety
------------------

While stress and anxiety are related, they=E2=80=99re not the same.
Stress is a normal neurological response where the
fight-flight-freeze function is triggered by a threatening event
(i.e., a rabid dog or ornery client) to keep you safe. Stress
chemistry, notably adrenaline and cortisol, activates your
sympathetic nervous system to get your heart, lungs, and legs
pumping at the expense of =E2=80=9Cnon-essential=E2=80=9D systems (i.e.,
digestion, immunity).

Anxiety is also felt in your body, but it=E2=80=99s actually all in your
head. When thoughts continuously activate the stress response,
you begin to experience symptoms like exhaustion, muscle tension,
headaches, immune suppression, and gastro-intestinal issues =E2=80=94 the

While our bodies are built to recover from acute stress, they
were not built for prolonged stress.

Your brain is wired to keep the stress response rolling. That=E2=80=99s
why meditation is so relaxing: it activates your parasympathetic
nervous system (=E2=80=9Crest and digest=E2=80=9D) and gives you the space =
to
differentiate between your thoughts and reality.

That said, habituated emotional responses are stored in your
body=E2=80=99s cells, holding the muscle memory of stress. This can still
unleash symptoms like muscle tension, racing heartbeat, and
headaches, telling your brain you=E2=80=99re not totally safe =E2=80=94 eve=

you regularly meditate.

Keep Calm and Carry On
----------------------

There are loads of scientifically proven ways to break the cycle
of anxious reaction by continuously engaging your body=E2=80=99s calming
systems.

* Take walks (

* Have fun: dance, laugh (

R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9sYXVnaHRlci1tZWRpY2luZS8=3D

* Do breathing exercises (

R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9icmVhdGhlLWJldHRlci8=3D
)

* Try other Eastern stress-release practices, like acupuncture
and reiki massage
* Stimulate your vagus nerve (

R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC92YWd1cy1uZXJ2ZS8=3D
) by gargling, taking a cold shower, or laying on your back, nose
in the air, and moving your eyes from left to center to right
* Get help from a therapist or other trained practitioner

Finally, I can=E2=80=99t stress this enough: self-care (

) is essential, and it goes well beyond bubble baths or a night
out. Don=E2=80=99t wait until your neurology rages: be the calm (
