Hi Hamza

I think you're onto something!  Here are the tests I mentioned I did based=
=20
on your posts:

1. Connected the Arduino into the laptop via USB only; not connected to=20
the 5V2A power supply - it worked, but I had only tested it twice (this was=
=20
a previous test a few weeks ago)
2. Connected the Arduino into the laptop via USB only; not connected to=20
the 5V2A power supply - it failed, this time I tested it more than twice=20
and it failed on the third try and continued to fail=20
3. Connected the Arduino into the laptop via USB AND connected the servo to=
=20
the 5V2A power supply - it worked!  I ran the test over 15 times on=20
different phases

If you purchase a new supply and it works without needing to connect the=20
Arduino to the laptop please post which power supply you got.

Thank you again,
Leigh Anne

=C2=A0<div><br></div><div>So the 180 degree servo definitely did solve one =
of the major issues (which was that the 360 degree servo would not stop spi=

 one I ordered (I ordered the TowerPro which goes for around $11, and recei=

is causing the servos to enter a weird loop? If not, then it must just be t=
