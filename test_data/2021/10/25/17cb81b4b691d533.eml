Marcel,

Just following up on our recent conversation to chase down a couple
separate threads;

1. Let me know about a talk in March 2022 - happy to help with any
materials that might be useful in getting this nailed down. In the
meantime, do you have any more specificity on dates for this? (I ask as
SXSW wants me in Texas sometime March 11-16 and my son's birthday is March
8th.)

2. The kind of board I'm looking for is in a company with strong growth
potential and/or access to new markets, either through existing capacity
that leverages new (to the company) technology, or through
partnership/JV/investment to create growth with new technology. In almost
all cases my outlier assets include a significant network to access said
partnerships/JV/investment opportunities along with an unusually broad
ability to scope, select, and strategize around same.

Otherwise I'm pretty open in terms of industry, markets, etc. as I'm
looking to get operational experience as quickly as possible.

Let me know if I can offer anything further or if you have any advice on
how to sharpen my approach to either of the above!

Very much obliged,
Josh

P.S. My Board CV is attached, just for kicks. ;)
