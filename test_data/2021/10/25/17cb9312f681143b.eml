 Dear Friends and Family,

 It has been a while since our last note but much has happened in the last
few months.  We had a great visit with our Daughter-In-Law Hannah, we went
to the wedding of our favorite SWUUSI son Daniel, we visited with friends
and family in Washington, we are continuing to settle into our new house
and community and we got a dog!

 Hannah's Visit

 Hannah came to Ireland for some much deserved rest and relaxation after
taking the Bar exam (which she passed by a lot!).  We had fun visiting
ancient historical sites like Newgrange, the Hill of Uisneach, and a
driving tour of various sites associated with Queen Maebh during which  we
learned that Queen Maebh was killed by a well flung piece of cheese!  The
coolest part of the driving tour was the Cave of the Cats or Oweynagat, a
portal between our world and the Faerie world that opens every Samhain or
Halloween.  We saw Roscommon Castle, Slane Castle (Where U2 recorded
Unforgettable Fire and Eric got to pour his own bottle of whiskey) and we
stayed at Kilronan Castle.  We went to the Cliffs of Moher and Galway where
we witnessed two hen parties, aka Bachelorette parties, merge and dance in
a circle to a busker playing Sweet Caroline. It was a wonderful visit and
we are so proud of Hannah!

 The States

 We made it back to the states to see one of our favorite people marry the
love of his life. We could not be happier for Daniel and Renee and wish
them a long and happy marriage! Colorado is a beautiful state and we
enjoyed the natural beauty of the Garden of the Gods but the best part was
getting to see life-long friends and hanging out with our son, Pierce.
Barbara was the greatest host and it was so nice to get to dance again.

After Colorado, we flew to Seattle to see friends and family.  Eric worked
the first week of our visit and I learned to can tomatoes with Jane, met up
with lots of wonderful people and had several great meals. I even snuck in
some time for myself, a trip to the nail salon and some Taco Bell for
lunch! We then headed up to Bellingham with a pit stop on Lopez for a
couple of nights of camping. I hope to never go so long without seeing my
family again. We had such a great time cooking, racing in go-karts,
walking, hanging out and absolutely killing it solving an escape room
together (thanks to Andrew!) I am so grateful for all of the wonderful
people that made our trip so great. Especially Leslie and Mike for their
generosity, Jane for her knowledge, Molly and Omar and Paolo and Natalie
for the home-cooked meals, Catherine for the swim, Rob and Tammy for the
apples, Aimee and Tony for all of the laughter and Susiemom and Pinkydad
for everything!

 Back to the Farm

 Eric and I jumped right back into the project-rich environment that is our
home right after we recovered from the jet-lag.  It is a much harder
journey on the body coming back to Ireland.  We had "dinner" at 5am during
our layover in Reykjavik and made it home at around 1pm which really felt
like three in the morning.  Eventually, we readjusted and got back to our
daily lives.  The barn stalls are now clean and we are in the process of
turning one of them into a gym, and one into an insulated hydroponic grow
room (for winter vegetables). We went to our first GAA match to watch our
neighbor's son who plays Gaelic football in Roscommon and discovered that
there is a great bar very close to our house at the St. Brigid GAA club.  I
had my first bee-keeping lesson with our neighbor Joe, who is now my
bee-mentor, and got to don the full bee suit. We gathered sloe berries from
the blackthorn trees and started our first attempt at making sloe gin and
sloe vodka.  We collected many hazelnuts and built a drying rack which
required a new powertool, they have about two weeks left before I can
attempt homemade nutella. We met with the forestry ranger Alec and filled
out an application to convert a little under three hectares of our land
back to native forest. It is a great deal for us. Eric has been clearing
the rock circle, collecting and cutting wood from our property. He just got
an electric chainsaw from a guy named Ollie who he met through our neighbor
Dony.  In Ireland it is really about who you know. Ollie is going to help
us on our quest to get an electric tractor which thus far has been quite a
frustrating process.  Dony also introduced us to the plumber Billy, who
fixed our boiler, who then introduced us to Shane who is going to help us
get solar panels.  Today we also purchased our first two apple trees for
our future orchard.

 The Best News

 The very best thing we did when we got home was fill out the form for the
ISPCA for a dog.  After they came out for a house visit to make sure we had
proper fencing and were decent people, we were matched with an amazing 2
year old Collie/German Shepard mix who we now call Finn.  His full name is
Finn McDrool Frazier and he is a very good boy.  Finn likes walks, car
rides, toys and especially belly rubs.  Finn does not like white vans,
baths or being left alone.  We have been working on teaching Finn new
commands, he is a quick learner but a bit stubborn and is very reluctant to
drop his toys.  We have also been working on socializing him with our
neighbor's dog Lucy, a very hyper 6 year old Lab.  They love running
through the fields together but she can be a little much for him
sometimes.  We have been bringing Lucy over during the week while her dog
parents are at work and Finn got to hang out at their house on Friday when
Eric and I went to Galway for a comedy show.  We were also able to donate
the hay currently in our barn to the ISPCA and they should be picking it up
later this week, save 2 bales for Anne Marie's donkeys.

 Wishing you all the best!

 Much Love,

Eric and Mart
