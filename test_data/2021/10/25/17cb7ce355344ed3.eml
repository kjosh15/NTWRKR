Kes,

Circling back around - we're looking at the potential of a 1600-company
project on DE&I as well as some regulatory angles (IQSM in the EU and ESG
in the US), a potential project with MIT/Sloan, and likely doubling our
number of employees served this quarter. So very busy! Would love to catch
up and hear about your plans when you get a chance.

All best,
Josh
