Laura,

Thanks for the call the other day; it was fun to see you actually in an
office! As ever, I  appreciated the clear thinking and advice on next
steps. You'd asked for two things from me:

1. What IndigoU could look like:

This is an instance of our system being used by a student group to explore
the potential role of values and behavior metrics in creating better
alignment. Optimally we could correlate these soft skills with hard KPIs
already used by the group, but the main goal is to get feedback on how
"untrained" members can best benefit from our system.

Put another way, we have a hypothesis that better alignment around core
values - and the behaviors that the group uses to define them - creates
better outcomes. We'd like to test that in a university setting.

Practically, this is a group of > 10 students working together for > 6
weeks with a clear set of values which can be described as a series of
behavior statements, and whom are interested in meeting with us at the
beginning, middle, and end of the project to evaluate results.

2. What we'd like out of the contract:

We want to be able to point to doing work with Wharton (and your group in
particular) on the Indigometrics platform in our public materials
(primarily in our press releases and website). As the NDA stands now we're
restricted from telling anyone we're doing anything together. We don't need
to specify the project until/if results are published, but do want to be
able to mention it to prospective clients as soon as we begin collaboration=
.

Let me know if the above fits the bill and if so where we can best start!

Many thanks,
Josh
