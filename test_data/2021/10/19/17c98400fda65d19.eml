This is useful detective work, thanks! I haven't seen anything like it with
the servos we've used, but as noted there's been a big influx of much
lower-quality ones in the last year or two that could be contributing to
the problem. I think you're right about the two power sources; can you
confirm that the problem is "noise" created by the servo?

<br></div><div>So the 180 degree servo definitely did solve one of the majo=

obvious reasons as that is what it was designed to do). So I then purchased=
 the 180 degree servo and my post above shows how it worked at the beginnin=

I have noted that the servo I ordered was not the servo I received. It appe=

, is the code working for everyone else with good quality servos? As per my=
 original post in this thread, when I ran a test code for the cheap servo, =
it still worked. So could it possibly be a bug in the code that is causing =
the servos to enter a weird loop? If not, then it must just be the poor qua=
