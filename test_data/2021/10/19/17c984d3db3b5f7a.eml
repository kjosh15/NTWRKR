I have a friend who's in charge of innovation and partnerships at SXSW. A
couple years ago we were looking at setting up a W50 event for the
conference, but then... pandemic! Is this something that might be
interesting to you / the larger W50 team?

FWIW, it came up in conversation with my friend there and he's keen.

All best,
Josh
