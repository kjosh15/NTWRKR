Make scores relative to their correlation to the KPIs, and adjust that
relative to the most successful profile according to those KPIs.

I.e., take the most successful person according to KPIs, and weight their
IM scores (and dispersion) as ideal. Readjust each week according to KPIs
and viola! Self-guided directionality and relative weighting to behavior
changes according to KPIs.

This means each role, division,team, or social graph cluster can swarm
successful outliers, changing cultural goals and/or configurations as
market changes dictate.

It needs a way to intro new values over time, but otherwise might be a
secret sauce where training resources are available?

- J

P.s., an internal ally generated wiki-lxp could pair nicely with this tone
self-generating / re-evaluating over time.
