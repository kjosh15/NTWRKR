The author of the piece certainly describes it in awestruck tones, but I
wonder if it's not worth readying anyway - a different perspective on the
emergence of current politics, as well as a roadmap for the alternatives as
naturally occuring or progressive options could be just the ticket given
our current situation. I find it especially intriguing given the available
options for self-organization that emerging technologies provide.

What's your take?
