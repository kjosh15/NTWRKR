Nadie,

Rori tells me she sent you a deck on our human capital analytics platform.
We're currently seeing a surge in growth from large multinationals and are
searching for partners who can satisfy the transformation demands it's
creating within those companies. Do you have time for a brief call to see
if this might be a good fit?

All best,
Josh
