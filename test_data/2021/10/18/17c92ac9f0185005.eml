Hi Josh,=20

No luck just yet. I was actually in the process of switching the Arduino=20
out for the NodeMCU ESP32. I've just finished doing that and ran a few=20
tests but am coming across the same issues. So far everything works just=20
fine when the Arduino/NodeMCU is plugged into a different power supply e.g.=
=20
my laptop. I've also done a bit of reading and asking around on forums, a=
=20
lot of people seem to think that powering the Arduino and the Servo from=20
the same power supply is bound to run you into trouble. I'm wondering if=20
you have ever experienced anything going wrong after a while? Apparently,=
=20
the Arduino may shut down/restart due to the noise produced by the Servo on=
=20
the power line. This might also have to do with the cheap influx of Servos=
=20
you mentioned previously. Most suggest powering the two from separate=20
sources whilst maintaining the same GND connection. However, I imagine two=
=20
power sources would make things quite clunky and is not feasible.=20

Hi Josh,&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>No luck just yet. I was actually in the p=
rocess of switching the Arduino out for the NodeMCU ESP32. I've just finish=
ed doing that and ran a few tests but am coming across the same issues. So =
far everything works just fine when the Arduino/NodeMCU is plugged into a d=
ifferent power supply e.g. my laptop. I've also done a bit of reading and a=
sking around on forums, a lot of people seem to think that powering the Ard=
uino and the Servo from the same power supply is bound to run you into trou=
ble. I'm wondering if you have ever experienced anything going wrong after =
a while? Apparently, the Arduino may shut down/restart due to the noise pro=
duced by the Servo on the power line. This might also have to do with the c=
heap influx of Servos you mentioned previously. Most suggest powering the t=
wo from separate sources whilst maintaining the same GND connection. Howeve=
r, I imagine two power sources would make things quite clunky and is not fe=
asible.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class=3D"gmail_quote"><div dir=3D"auto" cla=
