Thanks man! Appreciate it and I'm excited to dig into this new role.

Thanks for the reminder. That sounds really interesting to me. What do you
have in mind?  And what's the best approach on how to understand what might
be possible?

Happy to jump on a call or move this conversation along via email if you
have options you can provide on the best way to navigate!

Sincerely,

Dhinuka
