Clarity on indigo came today, from Chris of all people. Talking with video
really helps - I wish I=E2=80=99d tried it earlier.
Big outcome was that a major way I can contribute to Indigo is in thought
leadership. Painting a vision of how indigo is ahead of all the competition
gives us an edge where we are missing it in terms of revenue or customer
acquisition.
It=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99m uniquely qualified to do, and a key adva=
ntage against
other competitors. I=E2=80=99ve qualified myself as a thought leader in man=
y ways,
and have been looking for ways to leverage that into significant revenue.
Selling IM would do that.
It also puts our choices in starts contrast to other startups. If we really
are aiming to change the world of work, being self funded makes a lot more
sense as it buys us the freedom to make choices investors might bot make in
the name of return. Going slow and focusing on enterprise while ignoring
the SME market makes sense because we need numbers of users over revenue.
And perhaps most of all, trying a bunch of divergent paths makes a lot more
sense when you=E2=80=99re trying to learn where and how you can get leverag=
e to
change the world. Wharton with IndigoU, MIT/Sloan and KPI experimentation,
regulatory markets and sports are all different avenues to potential scaled
deployments. Each tell us more about how the platform can be used BROADLY,
instead of just deep and fast.
It also sets us up nicely for the partnership question. =E2=80=9CKPMG, I=E2=
=80=99d like to
partner with you to get to a million customers, because I want to change
the world and that=E2=80=99s the fastest way to get the data to do that=E2=
=80=9D is a
better pitch than =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d like to partner with you because we =
need revenue.=E2=80=9D
Optics matter, but it=E2=80=99s also a powerful position to take from a val=
ues
perspective. Indigometrics really could change the world, and technology
really is evolving faster than we think, especially around changing human
behavior. The Jan 6th attack, the division around vaccinations, the
Facebook papers=E2=80=A6 these are all evidence of us letting our technolog=
y evolve
into more and more effective controls steered solely by capitalism.
But capitalism isn=E2=80=99t designed as a moral force. We are having our s=
ocieties
shaped by technologies which we=E2=80=99re designed for extraction of value=
, not to
build anything habitable.
Indigo can do that. We are learning, and learning quickly, how to use our
platform to identify tribalism, bias, alignment, ideologues, influence,and
adaptive behaviors. We are establishing a data set and analytics engine to
not just metric how behaviors change over time and as part of group
evolution, but how behaviors - and the values behind them - overlap to
create change and impact.
The future of the corporation is not a static org chart. It=E2=80=99s an
increasingly dynamic web of relationships. Nothing less will be competitive
in the markets and workforces of tomorrow. Teams that assemble based on
interest, availability, ability, and alignment of numerous goals, including
values. Organizations that expedite service and goods delivery based on
algorithmically established just-in-time supply chains open to all. Brands
that exist solely to stand for something and who reinforce their value not
by the products they sell but by the integrity of the experiences they
enable.
In this new reality being able to align with people on behaviors - as,
where, and when needed - won=E2=80=99t be nice to have. It will be table st=
akes.
And our technology will enable this.
The problem is that right now it is enabling this by ensuring everyone is
enraged and oppositional. The attention economy has become the predicated
on conflict and aggression, because that=E2=80=99s easiest to induce and su=
stains
the greatest engagement.
Which is great if what you want is war.
A more peaceful alternative is what we=E2=80=99re seeing in China, but that=
 doesn=E2=80=99t
support evolution of values despite creating great alignment.
Indigometrics proposes that the capacity to control human beings=E2=80=99 b=
ehavior
much more easily simply by analyzing the data we can readily obtain about
them is coming more quickly than we realize, and that if we don=E2=80=99t
intentionally establish systems whose native outcomes are something better
than zero sum games we will all lose everything, by accident. Our own
systems will efficiently kill us if we don=E2=80=99t design them to save us=
 against
from our own instincts.
It can be done. The system we have now can correlate hard KPIs - the
backbone of existing functional organizations - with the company=E2=80=99s =
values
and the behaviors that drive them. We can bootstrap soft skills and create
alignment by surfacing the social contract; allowing the groups agreement
with itself to lift low performers up, without alienating them or ignoring
them. And increasingly we can help individuals identify specifically the
next step to take to be effective not just as a specific role, but as human
beings within a larger group of human beings - aligned by purpose.
