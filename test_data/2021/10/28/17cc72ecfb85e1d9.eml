Dear World 50 Alumni:

Great to have so many of you join this week=E2=80=99s conversation on Clubh=
ouse
with Vinovest co-founder and CEO *Anthony Zhang*
<https://www.vinovest.co/about-us> on adding fine wine to your investment
portfolio. Below are a few of the highlights from the conversation:

   - *Democratizing fine wine investment ::* Fine wine investment has
   historically been restricted to the ultra-wealthy, but now new technolog=
y
   and platforms are democratizing the market. Vinovest seeks to be an
   "investment sommelier" that anyone can use to enjoy the ~10% annual retu=
rns
   of a fine wine portfolio by solving the issues of market entrance and
   storage=E2=80=94not to mention the temptation to "liquidate" an asset by=
 pouring a
   glass on a whim.
   - *For cellar or for sale ::* Only the top 5-10% of wines are considered
   investable assets. Factors including origin, scarcity, brand equity, agi=
ng
   potential and clear provenance all impact a wine's potential appreciatio=
n
   value. Vinovest has even developed a proprietary index to track the top
   1000 wines, which typically appreciates 10% year over year. Unsurprising=
ly,
   increased consumption in 2020 resulted in peak returns of 17%, with 2021=
 on
   track for 14% returns net of fees YTD.
   - *So...how does Vinovest work?* :: After a $1,000 minimum investment,
   Vinovest's master sommeliers combine their expertise with quantitative
   investment models to curate a wine portfolio, making recommendations bas=
ed
   on risk appetite and investment preferences. Yes, investors actually own
   their wine, with Vinovest authenticating, insuring, receiving and storin=
g
   it. Wines can be requested from the portfolio whenever desired. Real-tim=
e
   updates keep users apprised of the current portfolio value.
   - *A more interesting investment portfolio *:: Vinovest is part of a
   trend toward alternative asset investing, and is already looking into ne=
w
   verticals such as whisky and more. Make money from things you love? Soun=
ds
   more exciting than stocks and bonds!

More details and sign-up available on the Vinovest website at:

*NEXT MONTH*: Join us on *November 17th at 11:00am ES*T to explore
maximizing human potential with performance expert *Dr. Andy Walshe*
<https://www.liminalcollective.co/team/andy-walshe-phd>. Full details below
and a calendar invite to follow.

Cheers!
