Just got off a call with them and they'd like a formal proposal. They're
after:


   - A more formal podcast next year w/ a minimum of 6 EPs
   - They'd like to understand costs and get an idea of the reach of my own
   brand
   - They'd also like to know about other partners Gilded would work with
   to grow that reach
   - They want a link to Built for Change as a reference.


Essentially I got the CMO really excited and she handed me off to their
local content team, who seem to have a pretty traditional view on earned
media and marketing. Internally Discover has a partnership team (which is
doing all the cool sexy stuff internationally) and a content team (who I
spoke to) who are trying to compete for the same budget, but a much more
general target (PR vs. partnership).

Can you help me pull together something formal to pitch to them? If so,
I'll send it over and simultaneously get the CMO looped back in to generate
enthusiasm from the top.

All best,
Josh
