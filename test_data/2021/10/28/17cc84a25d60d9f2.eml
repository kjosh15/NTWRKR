Flint , that takes a lot more platform discipline and enforcement than the
operator may realize.  SL had a teen-SL for the under-18 set, and had
'cops' running around trying to identify and eject adults who were
pretending to be young-uns, presumably for illicit encounters.  That's a
lot of overhead for a small market.   They found that the kids themselves
were better at sniffing out the pedos hunting there than the cops.

What's left of World of Warcraft still has a gold-farming economy; I'm sure
there's some naughtiness ongoing in Penguinland.

It's like fighting crime - there's no end to it and no 100% solution.
