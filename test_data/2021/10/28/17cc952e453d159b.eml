The decay concept is both an important observation and a challenge--will
tech (and other factors) ever get to the point that decay will be avoided?
And would that reflect some capability of more broadly engaging more
people?  The usual history of tech has sex helping to get something new
started, but this thread has referred to it (porn, specifically) as a decay
state.  Interesting question of what is the range of equilibria and what
does it take to get to each.

Regards,
