When the pandemic began I wrote a list of folks I really enjoyed and 
respected and who I didn't want to lose touch with. It's been a while, so 
I'm just writing to say hi and to send you and yours all best wishes. 

No response required otherwise unless you'd like to catch up - life is busy!

Sincerely,
Josh
