Apologies for the ping; I'm looping back around as Tinisha and her team
have been unresponsive for a couple months. This after suggesting they'd
like to move forward with one vendor or another in October but that all
signs looked positive.

Do you have any insight on if I should hang tight and give them space, or
is this a quiet way of saying "no thanks"?

Very much obliged!
