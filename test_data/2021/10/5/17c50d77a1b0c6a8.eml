The box wasn't intended, designed, or tested for use with a continuous 360
degree servo. Trying to use one would result in what we call "undefined
behavior" - I wouldn't know what to expect.

Best to use a 180 degree servo. Either the exact one we recommend or a
Futaba 3003 or 3004 if one wants to buy a more reliable servo than what we
are seeing in the recent crop of MG995 servos.

fter doing a bit of research, I think this servo is a 360 degrees continuou=
s servo that works on speeds rather than angles. Should I have gotten the 1=
80 degrees servo instead?=C2=A0<br><br></div><div class=3D"gmail_quote"><di=
