Just wanted to give you a quick update; I've spoken with the head of R&D
for the big electricity company here and he has quite a roadmap. First up
is building support for green industrial parks near energy centers so that
any agreements can be quickly deployed; he's asked that we reconnect later
this quarter to talk about how I could best engage, most likely in
helping facilitate access to and agreements with foreign investors.

I hope all's well with you; thanks again for all the help!
- J
