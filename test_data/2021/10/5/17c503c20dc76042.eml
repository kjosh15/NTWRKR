The general feedback I've received is that if it involves Russia and is an
independent investment it's a high-risk venture - i.e., not appealing to
most of the (tech oriented) investors I talk to. I'll keep my ears open,
but suspect you're going to need to access investors who know the space
and can qualify the opportunity better; most of the folks I'm talking to
have no context.

Apologies I don't have better news, and let me know if there is any other
way I could be of help!
