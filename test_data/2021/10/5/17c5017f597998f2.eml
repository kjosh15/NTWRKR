Josh,

Is there significant cost/risk if we keep more than $10k in our Icelandic
accounts (and thus require an FBAR filing)? I ask as we'd like to get an
Icelandic credit card for local purchases, and juggling under the $10k
limit to keep cash on hand for payments + cash expenses would be a little
onerous.

Just trying to make sure we're lined up for filing come EOY. Let me know if
this is easily answerable, and thanks!

All best,
- J
