Do you have any promotional/informational materials I could use to get my
team thinking about your (and distributed) work more intentionally? We have
our first RL all-hands coming up in November, and while we can't employ you
(yet) you're still high on my list of future partners - and it's very
topical given that none of our team have met each other in person yet!

Anything you could point us at to inform our thinking - so we can
understand both how we'd engage you directly and / or integrate you with
customers - would be helpful.

I hope you and yours are doing well!

All best,
Josh
