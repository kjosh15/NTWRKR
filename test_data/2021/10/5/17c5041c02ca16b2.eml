I'm ashamed to admit I don't know the answer to this question! Otherwise, I
was going to reply to Leigh Anne and tell her it sounds like her servo just
degraded. Didn't you say you had some servos that had worked well for you?
If so, can we suggest them as a more up-to-date validated source?

All best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

Just to confirm, does it matter if the servo is 180 degrees or 360 degrees
with continuous rotation? I'm wondering the exact specification of the
servo used by your team.  Thanks!
