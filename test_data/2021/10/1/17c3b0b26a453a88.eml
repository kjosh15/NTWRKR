Sure, I'd be happy to! Anything you're building is something I'm keen to
assist.

I'm currently based in Iceland growing a psychometrics startup
<http://indigometrics.com> that's seeing some excellent in measuring /
managing human behavior. Otherwise also sitting on advisory boards, hosting
podcasts
<https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/built-for-change/id1561378348> (#8
in Apple's Management category!), and doing retainer work on tech
innovation to senior leaders of multinationals.

Let me know when/where/how I can help!

All best,
Josh
