Just did some pickups with Nicki, but when I went to upload them from the
MixPre I had some problems.

I was able to mount the MixPre for file transfer and drag the file onto my
desktop. But then it got stuck at "0 Bytes" in the transfer process.

Then the mac gave an alert that it was disconnected without being ejected.
I tried again, and it gave me the "Eject 'MixPre' before disconnecting or
turning it off" message again along with an additional error from the
transfer; "The operation couldn't be completed because an unexpected error
occurred (error code 100006).

I tried unplugging and replugging the MixPre, which generated the same
error messages. Then I rebooted the entire mac, and it seemed to work. Not
sure what the issue is or if it'll persist, but figured I ought to at least
update you in case you recognize it!

All best,
Josh
