rut</a></span>=C2=A0 <span>October 1, 2021</span></p><div><p>A new execu=
tive role appointed at several companies in the past year ties together=
 technology, employee experience, engagement, well-being and data into a=
 modern, tech-steeped head of employee experience. </p><p><b>JPMorgan Ch=
ase & Co.</b> in May appointed chief information officer <b>James Reid</=
b> to an employee experience role focused on updating the company=E2=80=
=99s internal technology to improve the way employees work. Similarly, <=
b>Raytheon</b> in 2020 appointed <b>Kelly Candler</b> to vice president=
 of digital workplace and employee experience, while <b>Salesforce</b> a=
ppointed former chief technology officer <b>Jill Tucker</b> as vice pres=
ident of enterprise IT and employee experience. </p><p><b>Josh King</b>,=
 search firm <b>Ridgeway Partners</b>=E2=80=99 technology practice lead,=
 noted the trend in his recent third-quarter <a href=3D"https://ridgeway=
partners.com/ridgeway-partners-tech-leaders-on-the-move-q3-2021/" target=
=3D"_blank">newsletter</a> and pointed to its potential impact on employ=
ee happiness and retention. He wrote that average employee tenure is onl=
y 1.1 years at <b>Google</b>, 1.8 years at <b>Uber Technologies</b> and=
 2.1 years at <b>Dropbox</b>, indicating room for improvement. </p><p>Ac=
cording to King, the newly appointed employee experience executives are=
 typically former in-house tech leaders who are skilled at vendor manage=
ment and have a good sense of the various types of software employees ar=
e using or that can be purchased to improve the way employees work. In a=
ddition, they have high emotional intelligence because the role is focus=
ed on making sure employees are fulfilled and content. The executives ha=
ve to be able to talk and engage with employees on their pain points reg=
arding working from home or in the office and how they can work more eff=
iciently. The combination of tech and human resources, said King, is ori=
ented toward addressing what keeps employees from getting their work don=
e and leverages people analytics.</p><p>=E2=80=9CThey can=E2=80=99t just=
 be a back-end technology nerd with no EQ and no people skills,=E2=80=9D=
 said King. =E2=80=9CThis is a touchier, feelier role when you come down=
 to it, and it=E2=80=99s all focused on making people happy.=E2=80=9D </=
p><p>Companies have long focused on customer and client experience, but=
 the pandemic and the shift to digital and hybrid corporate headquarters=
 and offices is driving them to pay more attention to the employee exper=
ience role. King also pointed to =E2=80=9CThe Great Resignation=E2=80=9D=
 =E2=80=94 a term coined to describe the phenomenon in which thousands o=
f employees have left their jobs without anything else lined up because=
 they are unhappy with their workplace and want more flexibility, for ex=
ample =E2=80=94 as another underlying driver. </p><p>King pointed out th=
at some companies have lagged in engaging directly with employees and un=
derstanding what their return to work looks like or will look like. For=
 instance, a recent Washington Post<em> </em><a href=3D"https://www.wash=
ingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/27/return-to-work-in-person-hybrid/?ut=
m_campaign=3Dwp_main&utm_medium=3Dsocial&utm_source=3Dtwitter" target=3D=
"_blank">article</a> described how some employees have returned to offic=
es only to be faced with safety protocols that require them to interact=
 with colleagues using <b>Microsoft Teams</b>, <b>Google Meet</b>, <b>Zo=
om</b> and <b>Slack</b> =E2=80=94 the same as they would if they were st=
ill working from home.  </p><p>King said that type of disconnect could p=
oint to a C-suite that wants employees in the office but hasn=E2=80=99t=
 thought through what the return is like for employees on a day-to-day b=
asis. </p><p>=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re going into the office and doing=
 the exact same thing you=E2=80=99d be doing at home, there=E2=80=99s no=
 point,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CThat might suggest that the C-suite=
 is calling the shots =E2=80=94 they want you to be in the office, so yo=
u=E2=80=99re going in.=E2=80=9D</p><p>That approach could cause companie=
s to fall behind in recruiting and in retention. </p><p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=
=80=99s such a candidate hiring market right now,=E2=80=9D said King.=
 =E2=80=9CCompanies are saying, =E2=80=98We need to do whatever we can t=
o attract talent, and if that means allowing them to work totally remote=
ly, that=E2=80=99s fine.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D</p><p>While some companies ha=
ve =E2=80=9Cstodgy leadership=E2=80=9D that hasn=E2=80=99t yet evolved,=
 others are overly catering to employees, he said. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=
=99s a sense of the inmates are running the asylum,=E2=80=9D said King.<=
/p><p>Broadly, there has been a significant shift in the way some C-suit=
es and boards think about employees since the pandemic, said <b>Liz Foss=
lien</b>, head of content at workplace culture and inclusion firm <b>Hum=
u</b> and co-author of the book =E2=80=9CNo Hard Feelings: The Secret Po=
wer of Embracing Emotions at Work.=E2=80=9D Well-being has become top of=
 mind along with figuring out how a company should support the quantitat=
ive, technical needs of employees who are working in company offices, at=
 home or both while also creating deeper connections while working remot=
ely. </p><p>=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re working from home, it matters a l=
ittle less if you work at <b>Facebook</b> versus <b>Google</b>,=E2=80=9D=
 said Fosslien. =E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re in your living room, there=E2=
=80=99s a different logo, but it=E2=80=99s a similar job.=E2=80=9D</p><p=
>Some employees really want to be in the office full-time while others w=
ant to work from home permanently. Others want flexibility. In addition,=
 the emotional needs of employees have shifted dramatically in the past=
 18 months and have created lasting requirements related to mental healt=
h that employees are looking to companies to provide, said Fosslien. </p=
><p>In order to retain employees and to be attractive in terms of recrui=
ting, companies are increasingly focusing more intentionally on employee=
 experience and equipping managers with the tools they need to effective=
ly talk about emotions at work, she said. </p><p>More buttoned-up, tradi=
tional organizations such as law firms and financial services companies=
 are seeking out workshops and learning opportunities for managers to pr=
ovide them with skills to handle the emotional needs of employees, she s=
aid. =E2=80=9CPeople are feeling a lot of things, and they don=E2=80=99t=
 really know how to touch that.=E2=80=9D</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, em=
ployee experience roles were traditionally under the domain of the chief=
 people or chief human resources officer. As employee experience has bec=
ome more data driven, chief information officers are increasingly being=
 looped into employee experience conversations because there are privacy=
 concerns and because that data piece is essential to understanding the=
 needs of employees, explained Fosslien. </p><p>The role also underscore=
s the broader, governance-focused shift to corporate purpose and the nee=
ds of stakeholders and communities. </p><p>Previously, learning and deve=
lopment at some companies wasn=E2=80=99t as serious or embedded into org=
anization as it is now, Fosslien noted. She recalled an executive once t=
elling her that such programs were like perfume. =E2=80=9CYou spray some=
 stuff in the air and it smells good, and then a day later it=E2=80=99s=
 gone,=E2=80=9D she recalled. </p><p> </p></div></div></div><hr/><div><d=
