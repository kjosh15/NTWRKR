Owen,

Pleasure as always to hear your comments in yesterday's W50 Summit. I miss
those weirdly ostentatious conference room meetings!

Let me know when you have a moment to attempt to replicate them with
a(nother) zoom; I'm super keen to hear how the last year's treated you and
what you're up to lately. So, so, so much going on right now I can only
imagine the pies you have your fingers in.

Let me know when you have a moment for a call GMT.

All best,,
Josh

P.S. Do you have a contact at Red Bull? I seem to recall someone from there
talking at a W50 event and that you had some connection there. Was that
just my imagination?
