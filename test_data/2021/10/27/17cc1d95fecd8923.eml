Hi Josh,

Thank you so very much for the feedback. I am glad that some of the changes
and risks we took worked out!! There definitely are many connections
happening post summit!

Watch out for those tractors!!! I will have the highlights and
conversations available later today. I agree, Sean Marks was fantastic! I
will reach out to our team in regards to a continued discussion and see
what that might look like.

As I continue to gather feedback, I will let you know the additional
challenges - I think it will be more tech based conversations so we shall
see.

Appreciate the continued support!
Elyse
