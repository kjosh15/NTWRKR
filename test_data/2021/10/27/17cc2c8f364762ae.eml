									Ester Dean

Singer, Songwriter and Producer

Grammy-nominated songwriter, producer and singer Ester Dean offered insight

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/5f-3e94-490e-a471-0fc27d8b9988/jpdyhb/856484301?h=XKPVh6moWiCBS0KRurkrm7Rwuh51bNF5vfr_oya7-dk

 into her creative process, her keys to collaboration and how she communicates her perspective.

Putting together a hit :: As the writer of iconic, chart-topping tracks from Rihanna, Beyoncé, Katy Perry and more, Dean knows better than anyone what it takes to create a hit. For her, crafting a great song is like putting together a great outfit. “It all starts with you,” she said. The creative process is about trying out different pieces and seeing what you like and what looks great together. “If I’ve got nine out of 10 things I like, then it’s a hit to me.” There’s often a certain familiarity to the components of a hit; they tend to resonate with what you already love. After singing a riff that she loves, Dean said, “If I hear that anywhere in what I’m doing, I’m like, ‘Ah! Familiarity!’” What’s familiar can strike a chord. 

									“I believe that everybody is an artist. I believe everyone is creative, and I believe everyone should become the superstar that they are.”

									– Ester Dean

Filter the feedback :: “Who I am is a woman in search of feedback,” said Dean, emphasizing the role feedback plays in her career and life. But, she said, “I know that I want [feedback], so I only take it when I want it.” For example, if she’s focused on writing songs and someone tries to offer her feedback about business, she quickly filters that out. “If you don’t have a word for a song or a melody for a song … then the feedback you’re giving is wrong. It’s in the wrong time.” Filtering feedback to make sure she only listens to what matters at any given time ensures she stays focused on the task at hand. 

Getting unstuck :: Asked about what to do when feeling stuck creatively, Dean said, “I really believe that ‘stuck’ is stuck in a thought about the situation.” She recalled one moment when she felt stuck creatively and didn’t want to write for other artists. “I was stuck giving my gift away to unappreciative people. So, then I decided the only way to get unstuck was to walk away and go give my generosity … to another industry.” She then stepped away from songwriting to perform in the film Pitch Perfect. According to Dean, creativity blockage occurs when you’re unappreciated or not being given enough constructive feedback from those around you. The best thing to do is to find a different door to walk through, where you can get what you need to feel creative again. 

									“Everybody—before they go to work, before they take the job, before they do any of that—should be working on their costume, be working on their armor. … Everybody’s supposed to be creating their self first.”

									– Dean   

The essence of the artist :: Unless she’s collaborating with an artist, Dean is careful not to write songs meant for specific singers, as that limits a song’s possibilities. “So, let me not do it for them,” she said. “Let me do it in the essence of them. Let me do it in what I think I would want to hear from them.” 

A journey, not a race :: With her diverse experience working in music, film and TV, Dean shared her philosophy for determining her direction and future career goals. “I’ve never stopped. I’m almost never pausing. I just decided to … drive in the slow lane. I’m not trying to get to anywhere fast,” she said. “I’ll pick up things—souvenirs—for the next journey.” The next destination might not yet be in clear view as she picks up the “souvenirs” along the way, but when she arrives, she’s well-prepared. For example, she revealed that her sights are set on Broadway—and she’s working on an as-yet-unannounced show. But her Broadway dreams were several years in the making, as she started attending performances, considering whether she’d want to live in New York and even writing a song for a musical. “When it comes down to things that I want to do as a career point, I want to submerge myself” in that world. 

									“Vision boards don’t necessarily work if it’s a picture. But if you draw a picture, they work. … And don’t worry; you don’t have to see it on paper. You just have to see it in your mind.” 

									– Dean

									Kenny Mitchell

Chief Marketing Officer, Snap

Kenny Mitchell joined members

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/5d-13e6-4974-b5cb-b88f7abf853a/jpdyhd/856484301?h=XKPVh6moWiCBS0KRurkrm7Rwuh51bNF5vfr_oya7-dk

 for a practical conversation about reaching a truly global audience, marketing new technologies and strategically using insights to further user engagement.

Starting from scratch :: When Mitchell joined Snap as its first-ever chief marketing officer in 2019, he had a completely blank slate to work from. “I actually had to come in and figure out what role marketing would uniquely play at this company,” he said. This required understanding what was the core of the business, as that varies from organization to organization. Although he’d previously worked at companies that centered on marketing or operations, he quickly learned that as a software company, Snap was a product-driven organization. This informed his strategy and vision for the role the marketing function would play in the company. “Marketing’s job is to dimensionalize the Snap brand,” which includes driving awareness and understanding of the value that the company brings to its community, creators and advertising partners. 

Telling the story behind Snap :: Over the course of a listening tour around the company after he arrived, Mitchell discovered that storytelling would need to become one of his key priorities. “It became very, very clear to me that we were not doing a good job at all telling our story to advertisers,” he said. “Snap is a black box to so many people because it’s a closed platform.” Unlike with Facebook, Twitter or television, most advertisers didn’t understand Snap unless they were active users on the platform. It was clear that not only did Mitchell need to focus on demystifying the Snap platform to advertisers, but he also had to tell the story about Snap’s community of nearly 300 million daily users—who they are and what they believe.

Have a scrappy mindset :: Having joined Snap from large organizations like PepsiCo and McDonald’s, Mitchell found that he had to adjust his orientation as a marketing leader. Though a decade old, Snap still had “a very startup-y vibe,” he said. “Because of that, it forced me to break a lot of the big-company paradigms I was used to that I thought were critical.” For example, he found that important projects don’t necessarily require massive investments to deliver value, and that there’s not solely “a certain way to deliver craft.” Instead, scrappiness is what helps deliver value. He encouraged members to adopt a similarly scrappy mindset, no matter their company or industry. 

A lens on the future :: “If you look across our industry, there is a largely held belief that the next computing platform will likely be camera-based.” With the evolution of augmented reality, said Mitchell, “The camera has the potential to be the next cursor.” Right now, with your phone’s camera, you can try on clothing virtually or use visual search to find items, but innovative camera-enabled utilities will eventually outgrow the phone. From Snap’s Spectacles to Facebook’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, tech companies are investing heavily in this space to prepare for a future where camera-enabled glasses and AR will change how users interact with the world.

Author, Positive Intelligence

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/fd-9db5-4ded-9047-2a6b0cc65ed8/jpdyhg/856484301?h=XKPVh6moWiCBS0KRurkrm7Rwuh51bNF5vfr_oya7-dk

 his neuropsychological research about how to engage key mental muscles to improve mental fitness to lead to a happier, more productive life.

Mental fitness :: Chamine introduced members to the concept of PQ—positive intelligence quotient—which is a measure of mental fitness: “Mental fitness is your capacity to handle life’s great challenges with a positive rather than a negative mindset.” Positive responses include empathy and curiosity, but negative responses include stress and self-doubt. Mental fitness isn’t an innate quality bestowed upon individuals at birth; it requires exercising your “muscles.” Ultimately, he said, attaining mental fitness is the pathway to unlocking peak performance and effectiveness, well-being, and healthy relationships. 

									“Peak performance is only enabled through your sage mindset.”

									– Shirzad Chamine

Sages and saboteurs :: According to Chamine, the human brain can be divided up into two key parts. One part of your brain motivates you through negative emotions—or “saboteurs”—which include stress, fear, anger, guilt, shame and insecurity. The other side of your brain motivates you through positive emotions—or “sages”—including empathy, curiosity, passion, creativity and purpose. Unfortunately, most people are largely motivated by negative emotions, and they forget the curiosity and creativity that motivated them during childhood. Saboteurs are powerful, and they often mislead people into believing that they’re essential. “Life doesn’t have to be stressful. Life doesn’t have to be difficult. Those are all self-fulfilling prophecies of a voice in your head that doesn’t serve you.”

A mental workout plan :: Since the mental muscles on the negative side get exercised regularly, it takes intentional practice to activate the sage part of your brain. Chamine gave members a step-by-step workout plan for mental fitness. 

										Intercept the saboteur: The first step is to identify when you’re going into “saboteur mode,” which occurs when you have negative emotions. Pause and take time to label these emotions for what they are: saboteurs.

										Do some “PQ reps”: PQ reps are simple, 10-second sensory exercises that quiet the negative part of your brain and start activating the positive side. Chamine recommended the exercise of rubbing two fingers against each other “with such attention that you can feel the fingertip ridges on both fingers.” This brief activity shifts your brain activation, and it’s so subtle that you can do it in the middle of a stressful meeting or tense conversation to defuse negative emotions. Another PQ rep exercise includes listening to the ambient noise around you and identifying the most distant sound you can hear. 

										Respond with a positive mindset: Take on the sage perspective, which is that every challenge or situation you face can be transformed into a gift or opportunity. By using the empathy, curiosity and creativity of the sage mindset, you’ll help bring about the opportunity. For example, by being genuinely curious, you can turn a moment of conflict with someone into one that deepens your relationship. 

									“Absolutely everything can be converted into a gift and opportunity. That includes your mistakes. That includes your failures.”

									– Chamine 

Mindsets are contagious :: While your mental saboteurs can harm your well-being and performance, their damage isn’t just limited to you. If you’re in saboteur mode, you’ll drive those around you to enter their own saboteur modes. Conversely, if you’re in sage mode, you’ll likely inspire others to work from their positive minds, as well. “In the first minute of leading any meeting, you’re either activating the saboteurs in everybody in the room or their sage,  depending on who you were when you walked into the room.” As such, Chamine encouraged members to do PQ reps before they go into meetings to activate the positive side of their brains. 

 

									Member Town Hall

With Maryam Banikarim, Head of Marketing, Nextdoor

Brand 50 advisor Maryam Banikarim led members in a conversation about the evolving responsibilities of leaders and the challenges of building relationships in the current business environment. 

Be intentional :: When it comes to leadership, said Banikarim, “Bringing people along in the journey is a really critical part of the equation.” But, building and sustaining relationships has become far more difficult in a work environment characterized by digital communication and where casual hallway interactions no longer exist. She emphasized the importance of being intentional about building relationships. In meetings, take time to interact on a personal level—to see each other as individuals—rather than immediately jumping into the work. Carve out an hour in your schedule to identify who you need to reconnect with or need to meet. “You have to find a way to carve out open time and say, ‘I’m going to prioritize that.’”

Identify your three challenges to solve :: The future of work is a seemingly never-ending topic, and what works for one culture might not work for another. To narrow your focus and efforts in this space, identify the three specific issues you’re trying to solve for regarding the future of work as it relates to your culture. Then, define the three solutions to these challenges that you’ll commit to practicing.  

Members shared the following ideas, challenges and perspectives during the conversation:

										I carve out 90 minutes per quarter with each of my sub-teams, and we spend time just talking. Our last topic was: “What brought you to [this company]? What’s keeping you here?” We’re really intentional about topics that are not about the day-to-day business or the long-term brand efforts. 

										For my team, we’ve done some [2022] planning sessions in open air parks—bring your own lawn chair and sunscreen kind of thing. I’ve found it to be a fun—if not kitschy—way to keep some regular contact. We actually got to more creative ideas than I think we tend to virtually.

										I am enjoying these suggestions. I, personally, am feeling my tank nearing empty and know my team is feeling the same way.

										What about some time off? I saw Nike did it. We did a one-day global day off (too short). I think it was highly productive.

										I have been doing skip levels the last few weeks, which has been energizing. Has helped balance the burnout, even if virtual.

										I’m seeing an increasing gap in keeping those who joined the org during the pandemic engaged because they have such limited visibility to our leaders beyond scripted employee meetings. They feel disconnected from people but also from the “why” of what we’re doing. Knowing our leaders are strapped, how are you approaching this one?

										The focus on inclusion in hybrid meetings is a real, interesting challenge.

										And the added wrinkle now—unlike the past—people can actively choose NOT to attend in-person meetings, and it can be for very valid reasons.

										I have focused our last two quarterly roundtables on mental health and fatigue to bring the conversations forward to ensure people are not bogging themselves down and reminding them to establish relationships. 

										We’ve been doing a “one minute with” at team virtual all-hands, where a team member asks one person a few get-to-know-you-fast questions.

										We have extended the onboarding period for new hires in global—extensive one-to-one time with all the key network contacts, before throwing them into the work they were hired for; it seems to help in a virtual situation.

										We have “mental wellness” days (three this year) where everyone in sales and marketing takes off so folks can be off and not have FOMO.

										Are any of you dealing with other leaders or co-workers who aren’t OK with making such accommodations? We’re at this challenging moment where there are norms that are conflicting with one another, and I think we all probably deal with more old-fashioned work attitudes. 

										Yes, we have that happen. I’d recommend just staying vocal about the importance of those accommodations to keep people engaged. Probably the most important part of my job now is to be more vocally an advocate for the people that are in my group and hearing what they’re going through and trying to bring that to the organization.

										Everyone’s really strapped. So, these ideas of Fridays off or afternoons off just put a huge stress on the team because there’s still the same amount of work that needs to get done. It’s been really tough to get some kind of balance. 

										I put routine scheduled meetings for everyone in the marketing department coming directly from me. I’ve called it “productivity hours.” It’s a standing meeting that’s essentially hidden mental-health time and work-preparedness time, and we all have the same time blocked on our calendar to get work done. So, it’s a bit of a workaround in an environment that’s not allowing for flexibility. 

										We do screen-free Fridays—try to reserve it for those one-on-one conversations you can do on the phone. Encouraging people to go on a walk while on the phone or just get out of their home offices.

										Since we are still at home, we have flex Fridays: no-meeting Fridays and then the second half of Friday (post noon) is your time—no work—family, golf, house chores, you name it.

										Within my team, we do not have meetings before 12 p.m. on Mondays or after 1:00 p.m. on Fridays so people have an easier entry and exit from each week.

										We’re doing one global day off a month, which we started May 2020. It’s so helpful.

										We have tried things such as no-video-meeting Fridays and blocking afternoons, but have had limited success, as the business demands have been intense and the needs unpredictable. I’ve moved to giving each person flexibility as needed to take breaks and step away.

										Opening meetings with a meditation or gratitude exercise to ground and connect us. And lots of focus on well-being—gauging where we are on the various dimensions on well-being and actively managing to that. And coaching to resilience technique grounded in the principles of optimism. It’s been empowering, and it’s something we can do together to support and coach each other and our teams.

										We have “Zoom-free first Tuesdays” every month to force a meeting break and allow people to recharge. We’ve also done companywide shutdowns the last week of the year, and another one the first week of July. With everyone off, it helps prevent the anxiety associated with taking time off, because we’re less likely to return to a mountain of work.

										I think for us, the single most impactful action is to review everything we’re doing and figure out what we can live without—what to eliminate—rather than always adding more programs, more engagements.

										One hundred percent agree with you. That is exactly what I’ve asked my team to do to manage limited resources, time and burnout. It is really hard for them to do this.

										Starting each weekly meeting with: “What’s the one thing you are most looking forward to accomplishing this week?” It not only gets people forward-focused; it also helps others know what’s important to other team members and can help them achieve their success.

										The challenge is “buy-in” versus “modeling” the behavior so important people see leaders embodying the behavior, which is hard.

									<h1><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Stacy Brown-Philpot</span></span></h1>

									<p><b>Former Chief Executive Officer, TaskRabbit; Director, HP, Noom and Nordstrom</b></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><em><a href="https://go.world50.com/e/159871/8b-59d7-4fb9-98e9-fa6579993418/jpdyhs/856484301?h=XKPVh6moWiCBS0KRurkrm7Rwuh51bNF5vfr_oya7-dk">Stacy Brown-Philpot joined members</a> to discuss scaling creative thinking, how diversity drives innovation and shaping the future of work.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

									<p><strong>Creativity requires chaos :: </strong>Enabling innovation and creativity within an organization requires rethinking traditional corporate structures. “We all come in as an individual who wants to bring something to the table. And there’s something about the organism of the company that doesn’t let that individual come out,” said Brown-Philpot. She suggested that the solution may be to organize into smaller teams, which can move and innovate much faster than larger ones. “What that creates is some chaos, and a lot of big companies don’t want chaos. But, if you want creativity, you’ve got to have a little bit of chaos and a few constraints.”</p>

									<p><em>“The pace at which you grow should also be the pace at which you learn and the pace at which you fail.” – Stacy Brown-Philpot</em></p>

									<p><strong>Seeing opportunities :: </strong>As organizations navigate this stage of the pandemic’s effects, Brown-Philpot said, “This is a time to follow the customer, and the customer in this case might be the employee.” Underneath headlines about the Great Resignation, employees are communicating valuable information to their employers: that they want something different. “They are speaking loud and clear,” she said. “Even if it’s a small percentage of the population that wants something, if that need is a true-felt need that could be shared by everybody, you’ve got to run into it. … Figure out how to really make it work and how to understand it.” She encouraged members to look carefully at what’s happening and see how it might present an opportunity, rather than a cost.</p>

									<p><strong>Diversifying boards :: </strong>Every company aspires to innovate, she said. “And the only way to do that is to have the right thinking on the board.” To explain the power of diversity in the boardroom, she shared a story about her first-ever board meeting at HP. The company offered her a laptop to replace the iPad she’d brought with her, but it didn’t fit her needs and was too bulky to carry in her purse. This moment showed the company had to design a different product meant for a new type of customer. “Having the right person who’s going to show up at the meeting with the iPad can change the thinking of the CEO to really shift what’s really important for the future.” Boards are eager to diversify to get the right thinking around the table. “It can’t be the same thinking we’ve always had, because if we keep that thinking, we’re going to miss
some really good opportunities.”</p>

									<p><em>“Brands are figuring out what current culture is, and they’re tapping into current culture and finding a way to create unique experiences. … Knowing what you do and what you provide, and then infusing in some current culture is what helps you stay relevant.” – Brown-Philpot</em></p>

									<p><strong>Focus on the middle :: </strong>“Being the change agent is exhausting,” said Brown-Philpot. Some people in the organization are enthusiastic about innovation, but others are terrified. But, there’s also a middle category of people who are curious about, yet cautious, of change. She encouraged members to focus on educating and influencing that middle group. “They’re going to go with you once you prove to them that this is the way that we’re going to go and it’s going to work and it’s going to be exciting.” They’ll also have more credibility with the critics. “Focus on the people in the middle, because that’s the group that’s going to help you with the change and make it just a little bit less exhausting.”</p>

									<h1><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Sean Marks</span></span></h1>

									<p><b>General Manager, Brooklyn Nets</b></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><em><a href="https://go.world50.com/e/159871/6c-e879-401e-b165-4b7fe6fde8e5/jpdyhv/856484301?h=XKPVh6moWiCBS0KRurkrm7Rwuh51bNF5vfr_oya7-dk">Sean Marks led a conversation</a> about committing to a long-term strategy and making talent decisions that affect success at the highest level.</em></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Disagree and commit ::</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> The Brooklyn Nets organization has a culture of ownership and empowerment that applies to all talent, whether on the court or in the office. “It’s very important that the group feels that they’re empowered, that the group feels that they have a say, and they have ownership in all the decisions.” Marks shared that the mantra “Disagree and commit”—a guiding principle for many organizations—is emblazoned on the wall in the Nets’ war room to emphasize this aspect of the culture. Having an organization built on communication and collaboration requires empowering employees of all levels to bring their insights and ideas. “In that war room,
we’re collaborating; we’re disagreeing. I want debate,” he said. “Now, when we walk out of that war room, we’re all committed.” </span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“It’s really important to acknowledge and not shy away from … the elephant in the room: the pedestal, the pinnacle, whatever you’re trying to get to. And<span style="font-style:normal !msorm">,</span> for us, it’s to be the last team standing. … We don’t necessarily talk about winning championships all the time, but we talk about having championship habits.” – Sean Marks</span></i></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Scouting talent :: </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Marks learned how to hire the right talent while working for legendary coach Gregg Popovich, who would take potential new hires out to lunch to determine if they would fit the culture and what they might add to it. Similarly, Marks meets with potential candidates face to face but doesn’t ask about their basketball or analytics expertise. “You wouldn’t be here if we didn’t think you were the top of the top.” Instead, he asks questions like, “Tell me about your family. What makes you tick? What do you do for fun?” He seeks to identify the unique experiences and perspectives the candidate would bring to an organization that values diversity. “If you
are just cookie-cutter from a basketball background, the conversations start and stop at basketball, which is not something that motivates me, and it doesn’t keep our group energized.”</span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“I care more about the family dynamic of the office than what we’re putting on the court<span style="font-style:normal !msorm">,</span> because at the end of the day, if I’ve taken care of the players’ family, the staff’s family, they’re going to work that much harder.” – Marks</span></i></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Focus on offboarding :: </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Lots of attention is paid to onboarding new hires properly, but many organizations fail to create the right offboarding process for departing employees, which is a missed opportunity for recruiting future talent. “Offboarding that individual is so important, because they are going to be able to tell your story better than you could and more authentically than you can,” said Marks. “If I’m recruiting, I don’t know if people are going to believe me the whole time, but they’ll believe that player that’s no longer on our team.” For the Nets, effective offboarding includes acknowledging the family of the departing player or staff member and
thanking them for sacrificing so much for the team. </span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Have “appropriate fear” ::</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> How can you stay at the top of your game? Marks offered members some advice he also gives to those in his organization: Have “appropriate fear.” He said, “The appropriate fear is there’s always somebody out there doing something better than us.” Never get too comfortable, and always be looking out for someone you can learn from. “I want to get people out of their comfort zone and empower people to feel that way, too.”</span></span></span></p>

									<h1><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Ruth Carter</span></span></h1>

									<p><b>Oscar-Winning Costume Designer, <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>Dolemite Is My Name</em> and <em>Coming 2 America</em></b></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Trust your voice :: </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Despite being an experienced Hollywood costume designer, Carter admitted that being selected to design costumes for <i>Black Panther</i>—one of Marvel’s most highly anticipated projects—was thrilling yet daunting. To calm her nerves while meeting with longtime studio creatives and executives, she said, “I had to remember that because I’m helming the ship for costumes that there’s a reason that I’m here. So, let me start there with what I already know, what I already have.” When she trusted her own voice, she felt others become more open to her ideas and suggestions. </span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Designing a vision ::</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> Creating something truly new and innovative requires having a clear vision, communicating it to others and remaining steadfast in pursuit. For <i>Black Panther,</i> Carter sought to create a visual look that was timeless: steeped in rich cultural history, yet incontrovertibly futuristic. This meant eschewing trends and only including elements that moved the story forward. “That can be challenging, because a lot of people that work with you want things to be trendy,” she said. “They want things to be what they know.” She had to communicate her vision repeatedly to her team to make sure they understood they were creating something different and never
before seen on film. “I try to get communicated out to the whole group that, ‘Here is the big picture. This is where we’re going, and these are the steps that we have to do to get there.’”</span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“You have to be brave. You have to trust your voice. You have to be heard. You can’t be silent, but you also do have to listen and see what everybody else is planning.” </span></i></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">– Ruth Carter</span></i></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">A place at the table :: </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Carter had a bold vision for the Dora Milaje warriors in <i>Black Panther</i>—one that diverged from comic book illustrations and instead had practical uniforms representing several African tribes. “At a big, boardroom conversation, how do you communicate all the tribes of Africa on one costume?” First, she got buy-in on her idea from the film’s director, so she’d have his support in the meeting and wouldn’t be alone. In the room, she said, “Nobody really knows the details of what you have to get done. They do know the bigger picture of what we’re trying to accomplish.” By bringing in a well-crafted idea that people could react to, Carter
could tie her perspective to the film’s overarching goals, bringing stakeholders along with her voice and vision. </span></span></span></p>

									<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Inspiration through observation :: </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Although she doesn’t follow trends or weave them into her work, Carter seeks inspiration from trends in design and culture. “I people watch. I see what people like. I try to understand them through what I see them wearing, and I try to come up with a reason why in my head.” Her comments echoed those of a member, who shared that sometimes his job required “becoming an anthropologist more than a designer.” Being curious and observant about the world around you is key to finding inspiration and seeing how trends are evolving. Said Carter: “I’m always interested in knowing what our young people like and what they’re doing and what’s
the next new thing. I’m curious about what was before and what is now, and how do I apply that to now and tomorrow?”</span></span></span></p>
