Todd,

Excellent chatting with you yesterday in one of the breakout sessions! I
didn't want to distract from the conversation there but was curious if
you've done anything with CGMs (Continuous Glucose Monitors). I've been
working on a protocol to use data analytics (primarily a Baysian adaptive
trial) to automatically define the most impactful arrangement of UI data
elements to change behavior, and was curious if you'd be interested in
discussing.

This is outside my remit as advisor to W50, but based on how you described
your role I thought it might appeal. Let me know if a conversation is
warranted!

All best wishes,
Josh
