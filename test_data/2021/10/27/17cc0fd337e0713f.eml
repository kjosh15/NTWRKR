Thanks again for a great summit yesterday!! I spent much of it in
back-channel chat, but overall loved the format changes and content
arrangement. The breakout room duration shift was greatly appreciated, and
led to a lot more follow up (that I saw.) I've got a bunch of calls being
scheduled as a result and will let you know what else I find out, but
overall let me say well done!

I got my internet cut by a tractor hitting an electrical box (no lie) so
missed the last bit, but in particular the conversation with Sean Marks
stood out. He mentioned the role his analytics guy was playing as being
substantial and I'm curious how they're growing that element; is there any
chance I could connect to compare notes?

As always, I'm left with more ideas and questions than ever. Excited to be
a part of it; let me know if any challenges arose that I could chew on
before our next catchup call!

All best,
Josh
