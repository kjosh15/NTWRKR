"Lord of the Flies" is a term of endearment for me.   Your group had some
fun in a rebellious way, and I applaud that.  Obedient people rarely make
history!
 It only got tense while we were determining if our platforms might have
been at risk of being taken down irreparably. Once everyone felt loved, I
think we got back on track.

2010 was rough for us leads. I was fighting to keep SHARP SHARP, when
people over my head wanted it to be more like Brookings. In earlier years,
we had the autonomy and topcover to experiment with new methodologies
(within legal boundaries of course) not only in terms of what happened in
AZ, but throughout the planning process. That last year, there was
well-intentioned, but lethal, 3-piece suit intervention that really altered
outcomes from beginning to end - intervention grounded in a lack of
understanding (and even disregard) for core principles of the program...a
phenomenon not unlike Facebook's evolution to a Profit Over Ethics
mentality.  So given that, I am of the belief that we can examine the
Facebook situation with greater understanding than most.

Why don't we "just" put together a rebellious little platform grounded in
ethics and see if we can make it take off?  The time is right... ;)
