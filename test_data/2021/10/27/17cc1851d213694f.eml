I have not. But the sad thing is I don't think Second Life needed to go
this way. If they'd put aside a "civic grant" to keep unique projects going
they could have had an interesting space that wasn't just all the usual
rubbish. But they didn't and it just ended up a metaverse of strip malls.
No parks, libraries or spaces that weren't commercial.
