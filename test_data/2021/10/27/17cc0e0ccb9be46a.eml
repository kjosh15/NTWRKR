Saideep,

Good to see you yesterday. From the Accenture executive interviews I've
been conducting for the Built for Change podcast to some interesting work
coming out of a collaboration with MIT around KPIs and behaviors, there's
lots to catch up on! Let me know when you have a moment to reconnect.

All best,
Josh
