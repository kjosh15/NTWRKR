Tom,

Didn't mention it yesterday as I was too wrapped up in the sessions, but
congrats on taking some time off between gigs. I talk to too many execs
that don't!

Super, super excited to hear about where you're heading and what you've got
planned, and plenty of interesting stuff to share (lots around KPIs and
behavior via MIT/Sloan, potentially a huge DE&I project w/ 1600 boards, and
an interesting twist on Continuous Glucose Monitoring.) Let me know when
you have a moment to reconnect!

All best,
Josh
