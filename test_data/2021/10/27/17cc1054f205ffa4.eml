I did cry, but only a little. Let me know when you're next available! We
finally have data connecting hard data measurements on ROI to soft and
squishy human behaviors, so it's good timing for an article. From the FT's
perspective, companies are nearly-universally trying to figure out how to
spend their money Q1 next year, so a broader piece about the impact of data
(and tech) on humans might be well placed right now.

All best,
