Have you seen the Netflix Black Mirror episode on the completely immersive
VR world created?  It echoes the sentiment here, that all VR worlds devolve
into sex and perversion!  Heck you can even get a 'prostitute' in World of
Warcraft, ffs!    Just look for that mostly naked level 1 girl runnin'
around.  Sex sells, and it always will.
