Hey Steve!

*First off no worries about delays in response - I know you have your hands
full!*

If I don't hear back from you I'll try to spend some time next weekend
putting the parts I can back together and will tackle remaining problems
from there - either it'll hold or it won't!

FWIW, my biggest concern is in not knowing what I don't know about both the
glue and the assembly - i.e., where I can cheat to create more stability
given the breaks. A quick video call would be super helpful on that front
if you have the time, and otherwise I'll update you when I can!

All best,
- J
