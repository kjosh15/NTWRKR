I keep coming back to this:

"We just did a large sloan management review webinar on employee monitoring
(of which =E2=80=98engagement=E2=80=99 surveys were/are a part) and it was =
instantly clear
from the polling we did that most organizations are doing this for
compliance and control purposes=E2=80=A6.not to =E2=80=98learn=E2=80=99 or =
better refresh/promote
the culture=E2=80=A6"

I.e., the regulatory side is looking better and better. Right now that
means IQSM + ESG; do you know anyone strong in regulations either EU or US
that could help us spec out other targets?
