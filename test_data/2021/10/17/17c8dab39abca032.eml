CONGRATULATIONS!!! I'm writing this as my two boys build some epic lego
structures. Kids are awesome.

Would love to catch up; my cal is here <http://josh.is/scheduling> or
suggest something that (probably, might?) work for you GMT (I'm still in
Iceland). Looking forward to catching up!!

All best wishes and congrats again,
Josh

Hi Josh , It&#39;s been far too long since we chatted! Would love to get yo=
ur thoughts on this new thing. It&#39;s wild, it&#39;s big, and it&#39;s ex=
citing. After seven wonderful years, I&#39;ll be stepping down from my role=
 as Managing Director Blue Ridge Labs at Robin Hood.
 This work has been the most rewarding and meaningful work of my life to da=
te. The work our community has done, the impact it has made on the world, a=
nd the vibrancy and joy of it all is deeply humbling and incredibly profoun=
d, and I&#39;m so grateful for your
 partnership in making that happen. Although I&#39;m sad I won&#39;t be a p=
art of it, I am excited about the future: the Labs is in the best of hands.=
 Our team has done such incredible work and I have full confidence in Emary=
, Ollie, Allison, Gabrie and Lia to lead
 the next iteration and I have so much faith in their collective vision for=
 the future of this work. 2022 is going to be a big year here at the Labs. =
We&#39;ll be growing the team, expanding the Design Insight Group and the s=
cope of our alumni supports. More on
 these developments soon! As for the next chapter, in the middle of my pare=
ntal leave, when looking for a new job was the absolute last thing on my mi=
nd, I was approached by the folks at <a href=3D"https://helpkitchen.org/" t=
arget=3D"_blank">https://helpkitchen.org</a> to join the team as CEO. It&#3=
9;s an sms/tech platform
 that connects food insecure folks to free, on-demand nutritious meals for =
pickup at local restaurants, founded by Jeff Lawson, founder of Twilio, Eri=
c Ries and a few other folks. It&#39;s super exciting work, work I&#39;m pa=
ssionate about (I registered the domains
 <a href=3D"https://dopeoplestilldieofstarvation.com/" target=3D"_blank">ht=
tps://dopeoplestilldieofstarvation.com</a> and <a href=3D"https://isthereen=
