Good seeing you at the Innovating 50 Summit earlier this week! I'm a
special advisor to the group on technology + innovation, and wanted to
reach out in case it was worth a conversation to compare notes and connect.
As I speak to members across the W50 community it's always interesting to
share perspectives and connect opportunities!

Let me know if a brief call is worthwhile.

All best,
Josh

P.S. Have you seen my friend Samy's Iridescent chocolate

So cool!!
