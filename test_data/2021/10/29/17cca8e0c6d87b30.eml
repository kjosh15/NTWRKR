If money is a major driver for how a system is governed or self governed
then it should be designed in from the beginning.

Participation requires you to commit a stake which has some real monetary
value. That stake enables randomised participation in governance voting on
policy changes AND is also forfeited as a consequence of violating
policies.

The same forfeited stakes should be held in a treasury that is used to pay
out rewards for those who volunteer time to support enforcement of those
policies.

I basically stole the principal of the idea from how emerging Proof of
Stake cryptocurrencies work. The governance token enables participation in
the metaverse, helps drive a potential market place (NFT) and creates a
system that financially penalises actions contrary to established policies.
