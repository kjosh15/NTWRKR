Hi!=20

I think it might be a power supply issue rather than a Servo issue. I=20
tested simple code on the servo while the Arduino was plugged into my=20
laptop via USB and the Servo was connected to the 5V2A power supply (e.g.=
=20
making it spin to certain degrees and back again after some time). It=20
worked as expected. I then unplugged the Arduino from the USB cable (so=20
now, the Arduino and the Servo were drawing power from the 5V2A power=20
supply) and it displayed erratic behaviour (e.g. spinning uncontrollably,=
=20
not delaying for the specified time etc).=20

I tested this again, this time with the Crowbox OS. First, I tested it=20
where the Arduino was unplugged and connected to the 5V2A power supply (via=
=20
the breadboard, as per the specifications on the Crowbox website). The=20
behaviour remained erratic (as in the videos I uploaded above). I then=20
plugged the Arduino into my laptop via USB.* It worked! *The Crowbox=20
functioned as expected. Every stage performed well after several tests.=20

I contacted the shop where I purchased the Servos from and they confirmed=
=20
that all their servos should be working well. They suggested I use a 6-7=20
volt power supply. I have done a bit of research online and I noted that=20
people have been suggesting to use a power supply that offers more current=
=20
as well.=20

What are your thoughts on this? I will be purchasing a stronger power=20
supply. Is it possible that different Arduinos draw more or less power? I=
=20
am using the standard Arduino Uno R3, purchased from one of their=20
designated distributors (so it is not a clone).=20

Hi!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I think it might be a power supply issue rathe=
r than a Servo issue. I tested simple code on the servo while the Arduino w=
as plugged into my laptop via USB and the Servo was connected to the 5V2A p=
ower supply (e.g. making it spin to certain degrees and back again after so=
me time). It worked as expected. I then unplugged the Arduino from the USB =
cable (so now, the Arduino and the Servo were drawing power from the 5V2A p=
ower supply) and it displayed erratic behaviour (e.g. spinning uncontrollab=
ly, not delaying for the specified time etc).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><di=
v>I tested this again, this time with the Crowbox OS. First, I tested it wh=
ere the Arduino was unplugged and connected to the 5V2A power supply (via t=
he breadboard, as per the specifications on the Crowbox website). The behav=
iour remained erratic (as in the videos I uploaded above). I then plugged t=
he Arduino into my laptop via USB.<b> It worked! </b>The Crowbox functioned=
 as expected. Every stage performed well after several tests.&nbsp;</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>I contacted the shop where I purchased the Servos from an=
d they confirmed that all their servos should be working well. They suggest=
ed I use a 6-7 volt power supply. I have done a bit of research online and =
I noted that people have been suggesting to use a power supply that offers =
more current as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What are your thoughts=
 on this? I will be purchasing a stronger power supply. Is it possible that=
 different Arduinos draw more or less power? I am using the standard Arduin=
o Uno R3, purchased from one of their designated distributors (so it is not=
 a clone).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class=3D"gmail_quote"><div dir=3D"auto" =

did solve one of the major issues (which was that the 360 degree servo woul=
d not stop spinning, for obvious reasons as that is what it was designed to=
 do). So I then purchased the 180 degree servo and my post above shows how =
it worked at the beginning, but then fails to work afterwards. It appears t=
o be running into similar issues as Leigh Anne&#39;s servo.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>However, I have noted that the servo I ordered was not the =
servo I received. It appears the company have sent me a much cheaper servo =
brand than the one I ordered (I ordered the TowerPro which goes for around =
$11, and received a WAVGAT issue, which goes for around $4). I am going to =
try ordering another servo from a different company. I&#39;ll test that and=
 will be able to let you know how it goes!=C2=A0<br><br></div><div>I would =
also just like to confirm, is the code working for everyone else with good =
quality servos? As per my original post in this thread, when I ran a test c=
ode for the cheap servo, it still worked. So could it possibly be a bug in =
the code that is causing the servos to enter a weird loop? If not, then it =
must just be the poor quality servos on the market.=C2=A0</div><div class=
