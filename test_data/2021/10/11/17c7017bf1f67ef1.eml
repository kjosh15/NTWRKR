Maya,

Thanks for a great call earlier - I wish they were all such fun!! Looking
forward to the next when we can walk through our sandbox to examine
specific features and data connection points. We can discuss potential
roles in the emerging regulatory environment at the same time.

Let me know if the attached deck works for getting the right folks in the
room, and/or if I can add anything beyond that and the overview video
<http://indigometrics.com> on our website.

Looking forward,
Josh
