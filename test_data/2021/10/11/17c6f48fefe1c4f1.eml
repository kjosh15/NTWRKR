Are you up for scheduling something next week? We just correlated our
metrics to Key Performance Indicators (the hard numbers corps use to
evaluate employees. Mostly profit related.) Eye watering stuff, really.

Let me know if any times here <http://josh.is/scheduling> work or if you
can suggest something start of day in your time zone.

Hope you're well,
Josh
