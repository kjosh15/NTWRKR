><br></div><div>I think it might be a power supply issue rather than a Serv=
o issue. I tested simple code on the servo while the Arduino was plugged in=
to my laptop via USB and the Servo was connected to the 5V2A power supply (=
e.g. making it spin to certain degrees and back again after some time). It =
worked as expected. I then unplugged the Arduino from the USB cable (so now=
, the Arduino and the Servo were drawing power from the 5V2A power supply) =
and it displayed erratic behaviour (e.g. spinning uncontrollably, not delay=
ing for the specified time etc).=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I tested th=
is again, this time with the Crowbox OS. First, I tested it where the Ardui=
no was unplugged and connected to the 5V2A power supply (via the breadboard=
, as per the specifications on the Crowbox website). The behaviour remained=
 erratic (as in the videos I uploaded above). I then plugged the Arduino in=
to my laptop via USB.<b> It worked! </b>The Crowbox functioned as expected.=
 Every stage performed well after several tests.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div>=
<div>I contacted the shop where I purchased the Servos from and they confir=
med that all their servos should be working well. They suggested I use a 6-=
7 volt power supply. I have done a bit of research online and I noted that =
people have been suggesting to use a power supply that offers more current =
as well.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>What are your thoughts on this? I w=
ill be purchasing a stronger power supply. Is it possible that different Ar=
duinos draw more or less power? I am using the standard Arduino Uno R3, pur=
chased from one of their designated distributors (so it is not a clone).=C2=

 that the 360 degree servo would not stop spinning, for obvious reasons as =
that is what it was designed to do). So I then purchased the 180 degree ser=

he servo I ordered was not the servo I received. It appears the company hav=
e sent me a much cheaper servo brand than the one I ordered (I ordered the =
TowerPro which goes for around $11, and received a WAVGAT issue, which goes=
 for around $4). I am going to try ordering another servo from a different =
company. I&#39;ll test that and will be able to let you know how it goes!=
=C2=A0<br><br></div><div>I would also just like to confirm, is the code wor=

 this thread, when I ran a test code for the cheap servo, it still worked. =
So could it possibly be a bug in the code that is causing the servos to ent=
