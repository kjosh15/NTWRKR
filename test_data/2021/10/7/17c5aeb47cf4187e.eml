Hi Josh,=20

I switched over to the 180-degree servo and it is working better (to some=
=20
extent). I would suggest adding that small detail to the Crowbox website.=
=20
I've seen numerous servos that look the exact same. So if someone (like=20
myself) has never used a Servo before, they may not be able to figure out=
=20
if they should get the 360-degree continuous rotation of the 180-degree=20
servo.=20
