I agree it's something they could get use out of. I also think it'd be
really easy for it to get trashy games on it, or to be used to watch
YouTube videos, or to participate in social media. That's the primary use
case for the device, meaning we'd be signing up for another screen to be
vigilant against.

Not that this is a bad thing, or even one we could avoid if we wanted to.
But it's bringing it in sooner rather than later, which is a mistake I feel
like I made with the boys' phones.

The other issue is the expense. We're looking at buying expensive presents
for you and I both... this would bring that amount to over $1000, even
before other holiday presents and expenses. We still have ~$9,000 in debt
on the 0% card and $8,500 on the personal card.

Can we do a financial review before we decide on this? An alternative might
be to buy a used one or ask the family if they know anyone who has an old
one. Not trying to be a downer here, but I would ask that we consider all
the implications first!

xoxo,
Josh
