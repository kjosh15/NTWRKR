Morning Josh - absolutely up to chatting about this. How does Thursday =
look for you ??

No worries on Spain - sad though as you say. Would be fun to re-connect. =
I have added two attendees for them so far, and a couple more in the =
works. Will be a small private reunion for some of my super smart =
friends :) With one sadly missing exception - you. next time !!

Let me know what works Thursday=E2=80=A6looking forward to the mental =
gym as always !!
