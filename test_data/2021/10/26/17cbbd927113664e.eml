Bruce,

1. Looks like I'm not for Madrid; too much going on at the home front, and
too little direct business value to attending. I'm super sad about it
though, because late November in Iceland is the perfect time to go to
Spain....! (FWIW and in case they ask, I've only told them I've got family
matters that preclude my attending.)

2. That said, I would like a bit of your time to think through how Indigo
should approach regulatory markets. My cofounder (who is an ex-banker)
feels that we have poor chances as regulators are going to want to focus on
the small percent of the employees who have bad scores.

We're looking at IQSM and ESG as targets, with good intros to each... but
we need to know how to approach them. Are you up for talking through this?
If so, let me know when works for you!

Gratefully and with regrets for Spain,
Josh
