Hulda and I are trying to get ahead of planning for all the holidays this
quarter. Given that we're not in the US, a lot of the US traditions have
fallen on me to identify and bring to life, and I've found myself wracking
my brain for meal planning particularly. If you get a chance, could you
email me with what you remember as being emblematic foods for Thanksgiving
and XMas, both eve and dinner? Just looking to jog my memory here!

xoxo and much thanks,
Josh
