Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, I had a birthday. Just like
everyone else who survived that time it somehow seemed different from
usual, and it prompted me to ask a couple folks to send me a birthday video
wish as a gift.

I=E2=80=99m doing that again this year because I found that I went back to =
those
videos throughout the year to remind myself of why and how and who was
making this crazy time worthwhile. The folks who have helped me make sense
of - and fun out of - this whole mad experience called life.

If you=E2=80=99re willing and able, I=E2=80=99d love a short video on Octob=
er 15th to help
me celebrate having lived another year, and especially for your having been
a part of it. And even if not, know that I'm out here appreciating you for
being there.

Gratefully and with love,
Josh
