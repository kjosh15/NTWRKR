Mike is still quite keen, it seems. I keep coming back to this:

=E2=80=9Cthere=E2=80=99s an EX/digital transformation =E2=80=98ecosystem=E2=
=80=99 emerging that
merges/marries performance analytics with cultural analytics and
professional development investment that no one has quite articulated
and/or grasped=E2=80=9D

He seems to be pushing to be a part of the team, which is flattering, but
I=E2=80=99m not sure how it aligns outside of acquiring more customers.

Let=E2=80=99s see what sort of paragraph he comes up with and set another c=
all.
Wanted to update you on the below thinking in the meantime as it=E2=80=99s =
shaping
my approach to how we pitch Indigo at a high level.
