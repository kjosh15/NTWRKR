I just pointed them to your LinkedIn profile and sang your praises - but
yes, drink sound fantastic!!

One word of warning before you pull the trigger; we just learned that the
dates are smack dab on my wife's semester finals... so there's some intense
internal negotiation going on. I'll let you know once they've been settled
and if I am indeed attending, but didn't want to push you towards it if I
end up having to back out last minute!

More soon,
