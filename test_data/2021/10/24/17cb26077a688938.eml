Cool. I've got about 50 business contacts to send to. Can you order the
cards?

xoxo,

<div>Hello Josh,=C2=A0<br>
<br>
My name is Ashley and I am the Customer Service team member working with yo=
u.=C2=A0<br>
<br>
I am sincerely sorry for the confusion, and I am happy to provide clarity. =
The shipping address that you added to the order is the only place your ord=
er will be shipped to, which is why per order you can only select one shipp=
ing option (for example: international or local). You cannot be charged for=
 multiple shipping options on the same order.<br>
<br>
f you wanted to ship your order to multiple places you would have to break =
down the order into multiple orders. For example, if you wanted to order 10=
0 cards for you to be able to ship 50 cards to place A and 50 cards to plac=
e B, you would have to place two separate orders of 50 cards and add the re=
spective shipping address to each.<br>
<br>
I recommend that you ship the entire order to yourself and then you can shi=
p them separately to the different countries. I attached a file showing the=
 shipping fees to this email, you can review it.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if there=E2=80=99s anything else we can do to help.=C2=
=A0=C2=A0We&#39;ve also created a case number, 03844893, that you can refer=
