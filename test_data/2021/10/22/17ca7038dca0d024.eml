*TL;DR: Do you have time for a short call to walk through how to prioritize
opportunities and effort more effectively as a CEO?*
The NACD (National Association of Corporate Directors) just asked if we
could do a joint project using Indigometrics to measure DE&I in their 1600
boards. The English Rugby team just asked to expand their use of the
platform and to introduce us to the coaches of teams in soccer and football
(think Manchester United.) Sloan/MIT wants to do a joint project on KPIs,
and we have a 6,000-person company asking what sort of L&D firm they should
use based on our data - meaning we can engage a raft of them to attempt to
find more resellers. And KPMG/Accenture/EY are all actively pursuing calls
about partnerships. And add in a VC firm here in Iceland + our silent
partner both being interested in putting in ~$1mm... meaning we may be able
to pursue very aggressive terms on a chunk of cash in the new year.

This is all fantastic, but gives us a ton of targets and not enough time to
hit all of them well. At the same time our technical architecture is
creaking under the increasing amount of data and we are understaffed in
serving our existing customers' growing demand for reporting.

Do any of you have a moment to help me walk through these
objectives/opportunities? I know I need to prioritize my time more
effectively to make more critical decisions better, and I could use help in
developing the skill.

All best,
Josh

P.S. The biggest news of all is that we finally got KPI data from one of
our biggest clients and can now demonstrate causality between our data and
their KPIs. I.e., we can show how your employee's behaviors do/do not drive
your bottom line.
