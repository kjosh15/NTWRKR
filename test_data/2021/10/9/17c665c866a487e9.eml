Hi Josh
Not pedantic at all.  Yes, I tested the servo directly from the computer.=
=20
 It worked a few times in the beginning but then began to behave=20
erratically like when it was powered via the power supply.

Here=E2=80=99s what happened this morning with my testing:

   - I powered up the crowbox via the power supply for the first time in a=
=20
   few weeks.  It was in Phase 3.  Here are the results of the 15 times I=
=20
   deposited a quarter.
      1. worked as expected
      2. worked as expected
      3. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90 =
degrees,=20
      closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      4. worked as expected
      5. worked as expected
      6. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90 =
degrees,=20
      closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      7. worked as expected
      8. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90 =
degrees,=20
      closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      9. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90 =
degrees,=20
      closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      10. worked as expected
      11. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90=
=20
      degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      12. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90=
=20
      degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
      13. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90=
=20
      degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully- starts to=
=20
      progressively get worse
      14. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90=
=20
      degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully- starts to=
=20
      progressively get worse
      15. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened 90=
=20
      degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully- starts to=
=20
      progressively get worse
   - I cycled the crowbox through the Phases 1-4
      1. Phase 1 works - ends at open state
      2. Phase 2 behaves erratically
         1. worked as expected
         2. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened =
90=20
         degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
         3. worked as expected
         4. worked as expected
         5. worked as expected
         6. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened =
90=20
         degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully
         7. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened =
90=20
         degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully- starts=
 to=20
         progressively get worse
         8. didn=E2=80=99t work; opened, quickly closed 90 degrees, opened =
90=20
         degrees, closed 90 degrees etc until finally closing fully- starts=
 to=20
         progressively get worse
      3. Phase 3- behaves erratically from the beginning and starts to=20
      sound like the servo is dying
   - Here=E2=80=99s a video showing behavior in Phase 3 via power supply=20
   - https://youtu.be/2ya_aZCzS4k=20
   - Here=E2=80=99s a video showing behavior in Phase 2 directly connected =
to the=20
   computer - https://youtu.be/FDkqVepRcPY


The behavior points to the servo; however, I=E2=80=99ve gone through 4 serv=
os (all=20
the same type/manufacturer) straight out of the package and they exhibit=20
this behavior.  So I begin to question if it=E2=80=99s the servo or not.  H=
ow can 4=20
servos not work?  :) And remember, one of these servos worked as expected=
=20
for a few weeks.  I can understand that that servo may have started showing=
=20
erratic behavior because it was wearing out, but then to have the other 3=
=20
that came in the pack not work from the beginning is shocking (and=20
frustrating).

1. Josh, do you think this is truly a servo issue?
2. If so, is there another servo you=E2=80=99d recommend trying?  Here=E2=
=80=99s the one I=20
ordered: =20

The behavior points to the servo; however, I=E2=80=99ve gone through 4 serv=
os (all the same type/manufacturer) straight out of the package and they ex=
hibit this behavior. &nbsp;So I begin to question if it=E2=80=99s the servo=
 or not. &nbsp;How can 4 servos not work? &nbsp;:) And remember, one of the=
se servos worked as expected for a few weeks. &nbsp;I can understand that t=
hat servo may have started showing erratic behavior because it was wearing =
out, but then to have the other 3 that came in the pack not work from the b=
eginning is shocking (and frustrating).</div><div><br></div><div>1. Josh, d=
o you think this is truly a servo issue?</div><div>2. If so, is there anoth=
