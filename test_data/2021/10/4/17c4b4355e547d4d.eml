Realized after I'd left our 9:20am appointment that I'd meant to ask for a
certificate of health I could use for my driver's license application. I
believe I asked for one when I last visited (in May?) but never received
it. Is it possible for you to issue this? If so, my wife will be in town
tomorrow and needs to come by to pick up some vaccination records.

Very much obliged,
Josh Klein
