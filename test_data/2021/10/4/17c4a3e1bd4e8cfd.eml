EQ + Tech =3D Employee Happiness? Companies Want to Find Out


By Amanda Gerut =
<https://www.agendaweek.com/email-contributor/100834/3343244/424884>   =
October 1, 2021

A new executive role appointed at several companies in the past year =
ties together technology, employee experience, engagement, well-being =
and data into a modern, tech-steeped head of employee experience.=20

JPMorgan Chase & Co. in May appointed chief information officer James =
Reid to an employee experience role focused on updating the =
company=E2=80=99s internal technology to improve the way employees work. =
Similarly, Raytheon in 2020 appointed Kelly Candler to vice president of =
digital workplace and employee experience, while Salesforce appointed =
former chief technology officer Jill Tucker as vice president of =
enterprise IT and employee experience.=20

Josh King, search firm Ridgeway Partners=E2=80=99 technology practice =
lead, noted the trend in his recent third-quarter newsletter =
<https://ridgewaypartners.com/ridgeway-partners-tech-leaders-on-the-move-=
q3-2021/>  and pointed to its potential impact on employee happiness and =
retention. He wrote that average employee tenure is only 1.1 years at =
Google, 1.8 years at Uber Technologies and 2.1 years at Dropbox, =
indicating room for improvement.=20

According to King, the newly appointed employee experience executives =
are typically former in-house tech leaders who are skilled at vendor =
management and have a good sense of the various types of software =
employees are using or that can be purchased to improve the way =
employees work. In addition, they have high emotional intelligence =
because the role is focused on making sure employees are fulfilled and =
content. The executives have to be able to talk and engage with =
employees on their pain points regarding working from home or in the =
office and how they can work more efficiently. The combination of tech =
and human resources, said King, is oriented toward addressing what keeps =
employees from getting their work done and leverages people analytics.

=E2=80=9CThey can=E2=80=99t just be a back-end technology nerd with no =
EQ and no people skills,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CThis is a =
touchier, feelier role when you come down to it, and it=E2=80=99s all =
focused on making people happy.=E2=80=9D=20

Companies have long focused on customer and client experience, but the =
pandemic and the shift to digital and hybrid corporate headquarters and =
offices is driving them to pay more attention to the employee experience =
role. King also pointed to =E2=80=9CThe Great Resignation=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=94 a term coined to describe the phenomenon in which thousands of =
employees have left their jobs without anything else lined up because =
they are unhappy with their workplace and want more flexibility, for =
example =E2=80=94 as another underlying driver.=20

King pointed out that some companies have lagged in engaging directly =
with employees and understanding what their return to work looks like or =
will look like. For instance, a recent Washington Post article =
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/27/return-to-work-in-p=
erson-hybrid/?utm_campaign=3Dwp_main&utm_medium=3Dsocial&utm_source=3Dtwi=
tter>  described how some employees have returned to offices only to be =
faced with safety protocols that require them to interact with =
colleagues using Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Zoom and Slack =E2=80=94 =
the same as they would if they were still working from home.=20

King said that type of disconnect could point to a C-suite that wants =
employees in the office but hasn=E2=80=99t thought through what the =
return is like for employees on a day-to-day basis.=20

=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re going into the office and doing the exact =
same thing you=E2=80=99d be doing at home, there=E2=80=99s no =
point,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CThat might suggest that the C-suite =
is calling the shots =E2=80=94 they want you to be in the office, so =
you=E2=80=99re going in.=E2=80=9D

That approach could cause companies to fall behind in recruiting and in =
retention.=20

=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s such a candidate hiring market right now,=E2=80=9D =
said King. =E2=80=9CCompanies are saying, =E2=80=98We need to do =
whatever we can to attract talent, and if that means allowing them to =
work totally remotely, that=E2=80=99s fine.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

While some companies have =E2=80=9Cstodgy leadership=E2=80=9D that =
hasn=E2=80=99t yet evolved, others are overly catering to employees, he =
said. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a sense of the inmates are running the =
asylum,=E2=80=9D said King.

Broadly, there has been a significant shift in the way some C-suites and =
boards think about employees since the pandemic, said Liz Fosslien, head =
of content at workplace culture and inclusion firm Humu and co-author of =
the book =E2=80=9CNo Hard Feelings: The Secret Power of Embracing =
Emotions at Work.=E2=80=9D Well-being has become top of mind along with =
figuring out how a company should support the quantitative, technical =
needs of employees who are working in company offices, at home or both =
while also creating deeper connections while working remotely.=20

=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re working from home, it matters a little less =
if you work at Facebook versus Google,=E2=80=9D said Fosslien. =
=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re in your living room, there=E2=80=99s a =
different logo, but it=E2=80=99s a similar job.=E2=80=9D

Some employees really want to be in the office full-time while others =
want to work from home permanently. Others want flexibility. In =
addition, the emotional needs of employees have shifted dramatically in =
the past 18 months and have created lasting requirements related to =
mental health that employees are looking to companies to provide, said =
Fosslien.=20

In order to retain employees and to be attractive in terms of =
recruiting, companies are increasingly focusing more intentionally on =
employee experience and equipping managers with the tools they need to =
effectively talk about emotions at work, she said.=20

More buttoned-up, traditional organizations such as law firms and =
financial services companies are seeking out workshops and learning =
opportunities for managers to provide them with skills to handle the =
emotional needs of employees, she said. =E2=80=9CPeople are feeling a =
lot of things, and they don=E2=80=99t really know how to touch =
that.=E2=80=9D

Prior to the pandemic, employee experience roles were traditionally =
under the domain of the chief people or chief human resources officer. =
As employee experience has become more data driven, chief information =
officers are increasingly being looped into employee experience =
conversations because there are privacy concerns and because that data =
piece is essential to understanding the needs of employees, explained =
Fosslien.=20

The role also underscores the broader, governance-focused shift to =
corporate purpose and the needs of stakeholders and communities.=20

Previously, learning and development at some companies wasn=E2=80=99t as =
serious or embedded into organization as it is now, Fosslien noted. She =
recalled an executive once telling her that such programs were like =
perfume. =E2=80=9CYou spray some stuff in the air and it smells good, =
and then a day later it=E2=80=99s gone,=E2=80=9D she recalled.=20

2021<o:p></o:p></p><div><p>A new executive role appointed at several =
companies in the past year ties together technology, employee =
experience, engagement, well-being and data into a modern, tech-steeped =
head of employee experience. <o:p></o:p></p><p><b>JPMorgan Chase &amp; =
Co.</b> in May appointed chief information officer <b>James Reid</b> to =
an employee experience role focused on updating the company=E2=80=99s =
internal technology to improve the way employees work. Similarly, =
<b>Raytheon</b> in 2020 appointed <b>Kelly Candler</b> to vice president =
of digital workplace and employee experience, while <b>Salesforce</b> =
appointed former chief technology officer <b>Jill Tucker</b> as vice =
president of enterprise IT and employee experience. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p><b>Josh King</b>, search firm <b>Ridgeway =
Partners</b>=E2=80=99 technology practice lead, noted the trend in his =
recent third-quarter <a =
href=3D"https://ridgewaypartners.com/ridgeway-partners-tech-leaders-on-th=
e-move-q3-2021/" target=3D"_blank">newsletter</a> and pointed to its =
potential impact on employee happiness and retention. He wrote that =
average employee tenure is only 1.1 years at <b>Google</b>, 1.8 years at =
<b>Uber Technologies</b> and 2.1 years at <b>Dropbox</b>, indicating =
room for improvement. <o:p></o:p></p><p>According to King, the newly =
appointed employee experience executives are typically former in-house =
tech leaders who are skilled at vendor management and have a good sense =
of the various types of software employees are using or that can be =
purchased to improve the way employees work. In addition, they have high =
emotional intelligence because the role is focused on making sure =
employees are fulfilled and content. The executives have to be able to =
talk and engage with employees on their pain points regarding working =
from home or in the office and how they can work more efficiently. The =
combination of tech and human resources, said King, is oriented toward =
addressing what keeps employees from getting their work done and =
leverages people analytics.<o:p></o:p></p><p>=E2=80=9CThey can=E2=80=99t =
just be a back-end technology nerd with no EQ and no people =
skills,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CThis is a touchier, feelier role =
when you come down to it, and it=E2=80=99s all focused on making people =
happy.=E2=80=9D <o:p></o:p></p><p>Companies have long focused on =
customer and client experience, but the pandemic and the shift to =
digital and hybrid corporate headquarters and offices is driving them to =
pay more attention to the employee experience role. King also pointed to =
=E2=80=9CThe Great Resignation=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 a term coined to =
describe the phenomenon in which thousands of employees have left their =
jobs without anything else lined up because they are unhappy with their =
workplace and want more flexibility, for example =E2=80=94 as another =
underlying driver. <o:p></o:p></p><p>King pointed out that some =
companies have lagged in engaging directly with employees and =
understanding what their return to work looks like or will look like. =
For instance, a recent Washington Post<em><span =
style=3D'font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> </span></em><a =
href=3D"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/27/return-to-wo=
rk-in-person-hybrid/?utm_campaign=3Dwp_main&amp;utm_medium=3Dsocial&amp;u=
tm_source=3Dtwitter" target=3D"_blank">article</a> described how some =
employees have returned to offices only to be faced with safety =
protocols that require them to interact with colleagues using =
<b>Microsoft Teams</b>, <b>Google Meet</b>, <b>Zoom</b> and <b>Slack</b> =
=E2=80=94 the same as they would if they were still working from home. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p>King said that type of disconnect could point to a =
C-suite that wants employees in the office but hasn=E2=80=99t thought =
through what the return is like for employees on a day-to-day basis. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p>=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re going into the office and =
doing the exact same thing you=E2=80=99d be doing at home, =
there=E2=80=99s no point,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CThat might =
suggest that the C-suite is calling the shots =E2=80=94 they want you to =
be in the office, so you=E2=80=99re going =
in.=E2=80=9D<o:p></o:p></p><p>That approach could cause companies to =
fall behind in recruiting and in retention. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s such a candidate hiring market =
right now,=E2=80=9D said King. =E2=80=9CCompanies are saying, =
=E2=80=98We need to do whatever we can to attract talent, and if that =
means allowing them to work totally remotely, that=E2=80=99s =
fine.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D<o:p></o:p></p><p>While some companies have =
=E2=80=9Cstodgy leadership=E2=80=9D that hasn=E2=80=99t yet evolved, =
others are overly catering to employees, he said. =
=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a sense of the inmates are running the =
asylum,=E2=80=9D said King.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Broadly, there has been a =
significant shift in the way some C-suites and boards think about =
employees since the pandemic, said <b>Liz Fosslien</b>, head of content =
at workplace culture and inclusion firm <b>Humu</b> and co-author of the =
book =E2=80=9CNo Hard Feelings: The Secret Power of Embracing Emotions =
at Work.=E2=80=9D Well-being has become top of mind along with figuring =
out how a company should support the quantitative, technical needs of =
employees who are working in company offices, at home or both while also =
creating deeper connections while working remotely. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p>=E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re working from home, it =
matters a little less if you work at <b>Facebook</b> versus =
<b>Google</b>,=E2=80=9D said Fosslien. =E2=80=9CIf you=E2=80=99re in =
your living room, there=E2=80=99s a different logo, but it=E2=80=99s a =
similar job.=E2=80=9D<o:p></o:p></p><p>Some employees really want to be =
in the office full-time while others want to work from home permanently. =
Others want flexibility. In addition, the emotional needs of employees =
have shifted dramatically in the past 18 months and have created lasting =
requirements related to mental health that employees are looking to =
companies to provide, said Fosslien. <o:p></o:p></p><p>In order to =
retain employees and to be attractive in terms of recruiting, companies =
are increasingly focusing more intentionally on employee experience and =
equipping managers with the tools they need to effectively talk about =
emotions at work, she said. <o:p></o:p></p><p>More buttoned-up, =
traditional organizations such as law firms and financial services =
companies are seeking out workshops and learning opportunities for =
managers to provide them with skills to handle the emotional needs of =
employees, she said. =E2=80=9CPeople are feeling a lot of things, and =
they don=E2=80=99t really know how to touch =
that.=E2=80=9D<o:p></o:p></p><p>Prior to the pandemic, employee =
experience roles were traditionally under the domain of the chief people =
or chief human resources officer. As employee experience has become more =
data driven, chief information officers are increasingly being looped =
into employee experience conversations because there are privacy =
concerns and because that data piece is essential to understanding the =
needs of employees, explained Fosslien. <o:p></o:p></p><p>The role also =
underscores the broader, governance-focused shift to corporate purpose =
and the needs of stakeholders and communities. =
<o:p></o:p></p><p>Previously, learning and development at some companies =
wasn=E2=80=99t as serious or embedded into organization as it is now, =
Fosslien noted. She recalled an executive once telling her that such =
programs were like perfume. =E2=80=9CYou spray some stuff in the air and =
it smells good, and then a day later it=E2=80=99s gone,=E2=80=9D she =
recalled. <o:p></o:p></p></div></div></div><div class=3DMsoNormal =
