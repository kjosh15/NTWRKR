Thanks! Agreed on slitting the bread and the spray - intended to do the
first and have been meaning to do the second for some time. To be honest,
I=E2=80=99m just glad I got them in the oven; with H in school full time th=
ings are
busy!! But the boys love it either way, which makes it all worth it.

I hear you on the mixed flour giving a better crumb, but the more I
experiment with my own diet the more I can see a connection between white
flour and depression - pretty much I eat one and the next day I get the
other. I=E2=80=99d complain, but as H pointed out steering clear of pasta a=
nd white
breads has helped my waistline, so I guess I=E2=80=99ll take it! One thing =
I have
learned is that slightly undercooking the whole wheat and letting it cool
completely gives a much softer loaf that the under-10 y.o. set seem to
really like. It=E2=80=99s not an nice crusty outside, but hey - we get thro=
ugh a
lot of sandwiches around here.

Love,
Josh

They look nice. You should be able to get more oven spring. I note that 2lo=
aves (what appears to be a raisin bread &amp; the one next to it) aren=E2=
=80=99t slit. You should slit all breads, so they can expand when they get =
hot on the oven. I also spray my loaves with water when I first put them in=
 the oven - in addition to the boiling water in a pan beneath the bread. It=
 all helps with oven spring to make the loaves bigger and the crumb more op=
en. <br>
<br>
I have started using 80% King Arthur white bread flour and 20% of the organ=
ic flour that I=E2=80=99ve been using in the past (which is only coarsely s=
ifted &amp; thus a lot more like whole wheat when store-bought white flour)=
. This yields a much more open crumb. It=E2=80=99s a lot of fun experimenti=
ng and seeing the differences in the final breads. <br>

Sorry we missed you this morning. <br>
