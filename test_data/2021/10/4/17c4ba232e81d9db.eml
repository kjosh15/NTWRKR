&gt; I&#39;ve been struggling with a problem (possibly because it&#39;s har=

&gt; It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s nowhere to go with the idea, but I =

&gt; <br>
&gt; If you&#39;re willing, please let me know, and what your availability =
is in the next couple of weeks. If you&#39;re too busy or not interested, p=
