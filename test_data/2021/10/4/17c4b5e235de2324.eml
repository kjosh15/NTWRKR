Very interesting, and not too surprising. As a separate data point, I read
this morning that the Singapore airport has had UV-scrubbers and the
highest possible quality air filtration system available throughout the
entire facility. This is before similar is yet available in any US
hospital.

I have us down for a call this Wednesday at 3pm GMT; does your calendar,
and does that work for you?
