Hi there-

I've been having the same issues. My servo worked properly for a couple of 
weeks, but then after numerous uses in Phase 3 the servo started behaving 
like you've described below.  I replaced it with three new servos, but all 
had the same issues from the start.

Here's the servo (s) I used: 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NQJ1VZ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 

If you determine how to solve this, please let me know.  Unfortunately, 
I've removed the box because it was frustrating the birds and me!

Thanks,
Leigh Anne
