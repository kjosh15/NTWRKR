Hi Josh,

Thanks for all of this wonderful feedback. I've got a call with Milano
tomorrow morning, so let me get back to you in about 24 hours. I'll think
about your questions 2a and 2b, and have responses for you by tomorrow as
well!

I hope your conversation with Andrew Young was fruitful!

Best,
Scott
