Absolutely brilliant chatting with you today; I think I confided in you
that a year and a half ago I decided not to work with assholes. Yet again,
you've totally reaffirmed that decision. Really proud to know a leader like
you, especially in these trying times.

Also really excited about the possibility of working together.
IndigoMetrics has grown significantly since we last spoke, and it sounds
like there's loads of ways we could support each other. As per our
conversation, some starting points could be around measuring L&D, managing
culture change, and metrixing bias. Kick the tires here:

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$

Note that this implementation has all the bells and whistles turned on, so
it looks a bit busy. Again, we're white labeling the platform in order to
work with partners who can convey and mobilize the value of the data, to
the point that if you don't like our front end you're free to write your
own and simply submit results via our API. Note also that values are
completely configurable, so if you want to track more specific behavior (in
line with your growing learning portfolio) that's easy to do.

Take a look and let me know when next week would be best to reconnect. And
remember, no iPad until after 4pm!! ;D

All best,
Josh
