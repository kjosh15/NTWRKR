This looks good, except that there may be resistance to doing a town hall.
Maybe emphasize that a video piece introduction is a second-best
alternative as a way to ease them into that modality?

I'd reconstruct this as a timeline visual and some introductory/summary
text to emphasize the value. I.e., start with something like:

"Introducing your staff to a new metric for soft skills requires proper
framing; some staff may fear being held accountable for under-the-radar
behaviors, or that they will no longer get credit for soft-skill actions
outside of core KPIs. By clarifying that IndigoMetrics is a tool for them
to understand and improve their value in the company leaders can empower
employees to acclimate to the tool more quickly, generating better returns
earlier in the rollout cycle.

One way to do this is with a town hall, wherein the leader explains the
purpose behind IndigoMetrics and how and why the organization has chosen to
use it. Alternately, a short video can be embedded in the introductory
email. Templates for both are included, below."

Does something like that sounds useful? I.e., the text you put in to the
right is definitely helpful, but in the context of a graph lacks
context/meaning.

Apologies reg. Comm1; I'd thought you were going to send it to me to edit?

best,
Josh
