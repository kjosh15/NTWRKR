If they're a global analytics company they're intuitively recognize the
value of modeling their internal culture ongoing. They're asking for help
in understanding and promoting their leader's coaching capabilities -
Indigometrics solves for that. I'd say push Lane 4 to pitch not just
empowering their leaders to coach effectively, but to tell them exactly
who, where, and about what. No?

I.e., Elsevier needs Lane 4 to help their leaders manage and coach more
effectively. Lane 4 can do that by a) producing the content to upskill
leaders, b) tell said leaders exactly what, who, and where to deliver that
training, and c) produce follow-on training as needed for leaders where
it's needed, ongoing, forever.

Seems straightforward to me, but as noted Lane 4 hasn't been getting it. Is
the above approach viable?
