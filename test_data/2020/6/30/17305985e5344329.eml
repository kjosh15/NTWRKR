This content is pure gold. But. It's got 4x more text than it should. If
you can rewrite this so Othinn can read it and tell me what it says you'll
have everything you need.

To whit, slide 4 has enough content for 5 slides all on its own. TL;DR is a
big problem here. I'd suggest pulling back and deciding what the "beat" for
each slide is. You're telling a story and you have plenty of evidence, so
just fill the shit out of index slides after the end. That way you can
focus on ...

Slide 1: The problem (in one sentence)
Slide 2: The opportunity (in one sentence)
etc. etc.

Does that help?
