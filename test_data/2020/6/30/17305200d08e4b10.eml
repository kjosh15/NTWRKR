Just earlier had a call w/ my man Nick at Canvas 8. If you recall we
visited them during my last trip to London. He's pivoted his company from
straight market research to three initiatives; 1. an L&D portfolio of
successful marketing skills, 2. a tracking framework for cultural
adaptation during Covid-19, and 3. a culture transformation advisory
service based on same.

When we talked about Indigo's approach to whitelabeling he got terribly
excited, specifically because he recently went head to head with Accenture
to get Facebook as a client in order to figure out how to manage their
employee sentiment. As you know, FB employees largely think they're run by
a child and are furious about it. Nick needs a way to measure and manage
that at scale.

His other big target is Nike, who have been in the news extensively for BLM
affronts. He doesn't have them as a client yet but sees them as a perfect
target and knows their head of global brand. He'd like to pitch Indigo as a
whitelabeled Canvas 8 service to both.

I sent him our sandbox and we'll talk about next week.

Onward!
