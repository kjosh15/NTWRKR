This is amazing!!! In order:

1. Milano Harden's work looks incredible. My big question is this: we can
measure bias in individuals in an organization with a high degree of
accuracy, especially around specific values. How do we use this to create
greater equity, instead of exacerbating it?

2. Your primer is ... so needed. Not sure how else to describe it except
that I cannot wait to make it available to my own kids and to use it
myself. Two places to start:

2.a. IndigoMetrics is excellent at measuring the efficacy of L&D efforts
around corporations' core values (and/or any other value). If you'd like
statistics on the impact your material has, we can provide it. (I'll
underwrite this myself!!!) When/where/how can we help support?

2.b. Ella Baker is facing a pivot point in which it will have to support an
entire k-12 school remotely. Their core operating principle is equality and
inclusion. How can we use this to help structure and amplify what makes
them unique within a remote learning context, and does this help validate
your material?

Onward!!
