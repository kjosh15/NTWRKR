I double checked and it looks like you can just keep our login (
huldae@yahoo.com) and switch the delivery address to start. (I'll send the
pword separately.) It's $30 minimum per week, orders must be placed by 5pm
Friday, and you can edit until 11am Sat. Our delivery slot is 6-9am
Sundays, but they're usually on the late side of that window.

Really, really appreciate you guys taking this over. Freshdirect has been
our lifeline for groceries and there are hordes of bots and/or real human
beings trying to get slots even now.

Let us know if we can do anything else to help on this!!

All best,
Josh
