The article below talks about a Japanese CEO (ex-entrepreneur, now runs old
Japanese business) and how he is constantly scanning Workspace to figure out
what is going on at his company and reduce the "chinese whispers" /
"telephone" . He is obviously doing it inefficiently and inconsistently but
digital tools can help with that (if they have good base data....)

 

I find this concept of what a 2030 company will look like fascinating - and
that it will include a small cadre of senior managers sitting in front of
screens that tell them what is going on at their company - not just
technically but also what is going on with their talent / personal capital.
They will then pull some levers and monitor the impact.

 

This future of work is obviously key to what we are doing - wonder whether
you may have another blog post or article in you that discusses how the
future CEO will manage his human capital? Or maybe we see if BSS can
visually explain to current CEOS where they need to be going with human
capital metrics.

 

I think CEOs may like this concept of them as all seeing Svengalis moving
pawns around the board and being magnanimous because employees can now
appeal directly to them? "The future CEO - the all-seeing benevolent chess
grand master"
