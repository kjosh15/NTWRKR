So, the code shouldn't be at fault unless you've edited it.

We need to see a photo of the wiring on the electronics sled so we can
validate it. A cell phone video of the misbehaving Crowbox would also be
helpful. We need other information as well. Which training phase is the
Crowbox running when you sees this problem? It could be a wiring problem
with the coin sensor.

We also need to know if the sliding lid stays open for a period of time
each time you see this malfunction, or if it opens and closes immediately -
because that would be something pretty weird.

The perch switch only ever triggers a single cycle of the sliding lid, even
if you were to press it a bunch of times, or if your switch sent multiple
on/off signals. The coin sensor, on the other hand, will count each and
every deposit and will queue up the sliding lid to cycle a number of times,
equal to the number of coins deposited no matter when the coins were
deposited. This way each deposited coin *always* provides 15 seconds of
access, even though the door would close and open again each time. So
that's a possible avenue- the coin sensor could be sending false deposit
messages.

So, if we can gather these pieces of information, we can proceed:

-Picture of electronics sled
-Video of the malfunction
-What training phase?
-Does the door open and close immediately or does it pause between
open/close cycles?

Let us know how it's going otherwise!

All best,
Josh
