In more personal news, I&#39;m still in the end of the school year crazines=
s and still searching for my next home. I have been involved with multiple =
meetings for the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion including ones on=
 dismantling systematized racism at
 GRC, creating a guidance team for students attempting to navigate college =
after incarceration, a processing session with the peer navigators, etc. On=
ce the school year ends, I hope to recover and redirect some energy. In the=
 meantime, all good juju, positive
 energy and/or prayers are welcome.=C2=A0</p>
