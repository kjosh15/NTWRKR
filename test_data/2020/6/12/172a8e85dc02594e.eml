It's a competition. Beckham, son and advisor vs Terry Crews +
son/daughter + advisor.

Each team has a 8 hours to come up with a Lego machine that lifts a 30 kg
box 2 meters up in the air..... or something like that. Bridge that is
supposed to be able to hold a 3kg remote controlled bulldozer in 2per/sec
crosswind. etc.

Think of the Scrapheap Challenge (UK) only with Legos.
