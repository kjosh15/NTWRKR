Josh,

Thank you for your patience!

I was able to confirm that you properly updated the DNS record for kravmaga.fithit.com to point to the Sucuri IP address.  Additionally, I was able to confirm that you properly enabled the Firewall service for this subdomain.

Please note, the SSL installation can often take several hours.  However as a courtesy, I reached out to Sucuri to speed up this process.  At this time, an SSL has been installed on kravmaga.fithit.com which is valid through June 12, 2021.  This can be confirmed via the following link:

https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html?hostname=kravmaga.fithit.com

Please note, this does not force HTTP traffic to HTTPS so you will need to manually visit https://kravmaga.fithit.com.  If you wish to force all traffic to HTTPS, then I would recommend updating your home and site URL to https://kravmaga.fithit.com instead of http://kravmaga.fithit.com.  For information on updating your Home and Site URLs, please see the following link:
