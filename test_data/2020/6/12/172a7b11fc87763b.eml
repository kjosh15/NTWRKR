Hi

How about a show just disseminating conspiracy theories? Show
inconsistencies and talk to experts and even central figures? Go talk to
Soros and Gates and your other friends from Davos :) Go talk to conspiracy
believers and show who is really into it and who is in it for the money.
Talk to people on the south pole who are supposedly in on the flat earth
conspiracy and roughly calculate the number of people who would have to be
involved and the money required. Sit down with conspiracy theories to try
to find the criteria that would satisfy them. Find the pilot, the Navy
personnel or the big rig captain who believes this stuff. Show them talking
to colleagues about it. Take David Icke to see one of the lizard people he
has named and see if he is convinced that they don't have a mask.

There are some really good podcasts on Q-anon (reply all podcast) and such
out there but no one has really gone systematically into this with a decent
budget. Netflix has a show called "behind the curve", go watch it if you
haven't. But I'm talking about a series. A one stop destination for
conspiracy theory validation. With a decent research team, a charming host
(you) or two, there is a wealth of information out there and a lot of
interest. There is an army of debunkers out there that would volunteer
their time.

Everyone has someone in their life who believes crazy shit. Sometimes not
so crazy shit. People are interested.

Talk about real conspiracies and how they differ.

.... Also. My idea for a Lego show is bulletproof. That is show where kids
and parents can watch together. Teens will watch Taylor Swift and Bieber,
kids for the legoing, mom for Bieber and dad for Taylor Swift. Lego has
money on hand and there are Lego playing celebrities out there:
Terry Crews, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, David Beckham and my favorite David
Mitchell and more and more.
https://brickresales.com.au/blogs/news/celebrities-who-love-lego-1
Get them together with their kids or something to show them in a
natural surroudning, a graphics team + engineers to show the idea and
forces at play, f.ex. with a Lego bridge in a wind tunnel and let it
unfold.

Talk to you later.
Eiki
