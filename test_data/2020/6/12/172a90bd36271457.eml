Did this material prove helpful? How goes the launch so far? We're looking
into the waterproofing issue now, but need to get the other material edited
first.

We're trying to get to Iceland (which, it turns out, is much harder than
imagined) and are likely leaving Monday, but I'll continue to try to be as
responsive as possible via email.

Hope you guys are well!!
