Hi Josh,

I think kids are just hitting a wall... I would not worry.  Typically, he
is a consistent writer and *does* like to share (though maybe less so on
Zoom).  Next week, we will be working on fiction writing, so maybe Othinn
will find some footing in that, since I know he loves that genre.  If he's
really not motivated, I would encourage him to spend some time drawing,
then maybe you can help add the words later?

For the padlet, the prompt was to "publish" one news story.  It can be
written or a video report (or both).  If there is a photo to go along with
the story, you can include that as well.  Again, if it's like pulling
teeth, just skip it :) I am sure kids would love to see a news story by
Othinn though...

Eleanor
