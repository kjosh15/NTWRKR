Dear Family,

Since the anti-racist movement in my home city has been making the national=
 news, I thought I'd send out this helpful update from the front lines:


Copied and pasted, originally written by the people of Seattle=92s Autonomo=
us Zone regarding false reports from the media of terrorist activity:

1.) The East Precinct has not been burned down. It hasn't even been occupie=
d. The doors were left open, and after the shit the police pulled the last =
few days of the protests, no one wants to walk into that trap.

2.) Local businesses have not been terrorized or extorted. The local busine=
sses just spent a week getting gassed, as did the residents. The protesters=
 helped board the buildings up *to protect them from damage from cops* and =
their rubber bullets and concussion grenades. The businesses were opening t=
heir doors to protesters whenever the police attacked.

3.) They're not out of food. It's a small area with several wonderful resta=
urants, and most of the people there are residents of the area. The housele=
ss people in the area are now getting hot food and drinks. They're happy to=
 accept donations, but they're not starving, and the houseless people did n=
ot run away with all the food. Please stop believing random Tweets.

4.) No, businesses do not have to pay protection money, ffs.

5.) No, women are not being raped, buildings are not being burned down. Com=
e on, people.

6.) IDs are not being checked. There IS security, because in case you hadn'=
t noticed, the tangerine terror has devoted TWO tweets and one whole new mi=
sspelling to the movement.

7.) Everything I've heard is that they are taking time to heal and settle. =
Whatever you might believe the motivations or actions of the protesters, th=
e last week and a half were traumatic for the locals.

8.) Clergy have started going down there regularly to offer counseling. Med=
ics are on shift. Music, movies, community discussion, and decompression is=
 happening. I know several residents of the area, and they are raving about=
 how peaceful and joyful the area is.

9.) Volunteers are SUPER welcome. They need to have enough people in the ar=
ea at all times to help keep saboteurs from coming in and burning the preci=
nct or starting other trouble. For example, Tim Eyman showed up today, and =
was not set on fire, so you know they're under good discipline down there.

10.) These are not violent people. They are people who just stood up to a c=
orrupt, sadistic police force which deliberately shot concussion grenades a=
nd rubber bullets directly at medics. These police took a disabled man's ca=
ne and tried to force him to walk without it, they maced multiple children.=
 These are people who refused to be terrorized anymore.

I am really tired of the stories of vandalism and wanton destruction going =
around. These are good people who just lived through a week and a half of h=
ell for the simple crime of trying to call the police to accountability.

Please share this. The Seattle Protesters are now being targeted in force b=
y alt-right fascists, and our 'President' has just thrown gasoline on the f=
lames. Please push back where you see these people described as violent, ch=
ildish, or out of control. They're very thoughtful people who've simply had=
 enough fascism and decided to stand their ground.

Strangely, last I checked, standing your ground was very 'Merican. I wonder=
 why it's suddenly a problem? *taps chin*" ~anon by choice




In more personal news, I'm still in the end of the school year craziness an=
d still searching for my next home. I have been involved with multiple meet=
ings for the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion including ones on dis=
mantling systematized racism at GRC, creating a guidance team for students =
attempting to navigate college after incarceration, a processing session wi=
th the peer navigators, etc. Once the school year ends, I hope to recover a=
nd redirect some energy. In the meantime, all good juju, positive energy an=
d/or prayers are welcome.


I'm sending big love and hugs!

-Devon

Strangely, last I checked, standing your ground was very 'Merican. I wonder=
 why it's suddenly a problem? *taps chin*&quot; ~anon by choice</p>

In more personal news, I'm still in the end of the school year craziness an=
d still searching for my next home. I have been involved with multiple meet=
ings for the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion including ones on dis=
mantling systematized racism at
 GRC, creating a guidance team for students attempting to navigate college =
after incarceration, a processing session with the peer navigators, etc. On=
ce the school year ends, I hope to recover and redirect some energy. In the=
 meantime, all good juju, positive
 energy and/or prayers are welcome.&nbsp;</p>
