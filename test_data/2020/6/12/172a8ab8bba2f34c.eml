First off thanks for the help in thinking through our ITSec needs in the
near term; I spent a few days with Kali and was able to do a reasonable
amount of reconnaissance and poking holes. It's not a complete process, but
it certainly demonstrated good first steps. We're working with our
enterprise clients around SOC2 compliance and are discussing how to
integrate the NIST CSF in the process.

(The NIST CSF doc is fucking brilliant, BTW. Whoever wrote the text
deserves a fucking gold medal for making something that's so dry into an
such entertaining read!)

You'd mentioned a friend of yours who recently left a firm that focuses on
threat detection; can you still make that intro?

Finally, if you're looking for a marketing company, the one I've been
working with that I felt did a good job of understanding the technical side
(esp. in articulating that to a general audience) is called Big Spaceship.
Let me know if you want an intro to the CEO.

All best,
Josh
