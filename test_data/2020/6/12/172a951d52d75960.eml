We worked really hard to find a way for him to work through his resistance
to writing, and in the end he wrote a poem that he only shared with me (in
addition to the short haunted house piece, attached.)

My theory is that he really doesn=E2=80=99t like to do things badly and fee=
ls
embarrassed by his writing effort. Do you have any feedback on that?

Also, did you want us to upload ALL of Othinn=E2=80=99s past writing pieces=
 to the
padlet? There=E2=80=99s quite a number of them!

Thanks!!
