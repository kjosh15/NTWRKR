Ideal. I'm trying to get my family to Iceland (long, long, story) so will
be a little scattered for the next week or so. I'll follow up with Joe. How
goes your house situation??

All best,

rging mode which can be toggled on or off by holding the power button down =
for six seconds. Unlike the Xiaomi power bank, the V15 stays in &#39;always=
 on&#39; mode and will power the attached device until the power bank&#39;s=
 internal battery hits the low-voltage cutoff. This is perfect for us and w=
orked very well during my testing.</p>

uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">The V15 is rated at 4,000mAh capacity but I found=
 that the pack delivered a total of 2,559mAh before hitting the low-voltage=
 cutoff. This wasn&#39;t a complete surprise, since a rule of thumb for USB=
 power banks is to expect somewhere around 60% overall efficiency. In my te=
st case, I observed about 64% efficiency. The energy we lost was likely con=
sumed by the voltage regulator and the charge control circuitry of the powe=
r bank.</p>

uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">An idle CrowBox consumes around 45 to 46 mA of cu=
rrent, so my test CrowBox was continuously powered by the V15 for around 55=
.5 hours. So, using a V15 power bank, I&#39;d suggesting running the CrowBo=
x for no more than 48 hours before pulling the power bank to recharge it.</=

els to extend the runtime of the power bank. If your CrowBox would be set u=
p in a place that receives some sunshine each day, it&#39;s quite possible =
that a V15 power bank with a Voltaic Systems solar panel would never need t=
o be shut down or brought inside to recharge. You can buy a V15 power bank =
and 3.5 watt solar panel direct from Voltaic Systems for $69 USD, which sou=
nds like a pretty good value to me.=C2=A0</p></div><div>&lt;text ends&gt;</=
