My family and I are Icelandic citizens and will be returning from NYC on
June 12th (assuming flights are available). We'd like to get a COVID-19
test on arrival so we can ensure we're not spreading it (we've had tests
here but will need tests after travel). We also suspect it would be
interesting for you to have recent blood samples from NYC. Is it possible
to arrange something like this?

Many thanks,
Josh
