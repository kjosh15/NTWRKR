Just had a short call with the CTO of Sutter Health, the fifth biggest
healthcare provider in the US. I think they're looking at how to
create a cross-section
of Indigo/Oura ring data to improve health outcomes in teams. I.e., using
the team data to drive behaviors based on Oura ring data. Do you have any
thoughts on this? Would love to go back to them with an explicit suggestion=
.
