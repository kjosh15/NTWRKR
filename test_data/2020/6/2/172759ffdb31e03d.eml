Just checking in to say hi and see if all is well. Hit me with an update if
you've got a moment!

Life here is going well; still enjoying my weird position watching the
titans of industry attempt to "resume normal life, except different." We're
hoping to fly to Iceland in a couple weeks (assuming flights are
available.) And my behavior analytics startup is continuing to grow. So all
good things!

All best wishes,
Josh
