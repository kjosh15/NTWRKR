Here's my co-founder's first attempt at a diagram; he's an old hand at
modeling but has been teaching himself python. Stack is python on windows
for the back end, X# on windows for the front end. None of those are my
choices except python, fwiw, but again that's why I need help in figuring
out our mid-term next steps in migrating to the cloud; once we increase our
cash flow we'll hire someone to rewrite the entire thing, but for now we
need to get SOC2 compliance.

I sent you an invite for 9am PST Monday; let me know if that works!
