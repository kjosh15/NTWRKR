So, the code shouldn't be at fault unless the end user decided to edit and
play with it.

We need to see a photo of this person's wiring on the electronics sled so
we can validate it. A cell phone video of the misbehaving Crowbox would
also be helpful. We need other information as well. Which training phase is
his Crowbox running when he sees this problem? It could be a wiring problem
with the coin sensor.

We also need to know if the sliding lid stays open for a period of time
each time he sees this malfunction, or if it opens and closes immediately-
because that would be something pretty weird.

The perch switch only ever triggers a single cycle of the sliding lid, even
if you were to press it a bunch of times, or if your switch sent multiple
on/off signals. The coin sensor, on the other hand, will count each and
every deposit and will queue up the sliding lid to cycle a number of times,
equal to the number of coins deposited no matter when the coins were
deposited. This way each depositedd coin *always* provides 15 seconds of
access, even though the door would close and open again each time. So
that's a possible avenue- the coin sensor could be sending false deposit
messages.

There's a very small Arduino program I like to ask people to run on their
Crowbox when the servo behaves oddly or erratically. It sounds like this
particular user is seeing the door open and close too many times per press
of the perch switch. So I don't think we'd learn anything from this
particular diagnostic.

So, if we can gather these pieces of information, we can proceed:

-Picture of electronics sled
-Video of the malfunction
-What training phase?
-Does the door open and close immediately or does it pause between
open/close cycles?
