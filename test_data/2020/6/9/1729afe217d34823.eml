So, we're learning that water incursion is a problem. I think the only
source of water getting in is the top of the lid (under the perch
platform). The two 'ears' on top of the box (the vertical tabs that keep
the perch platform aligned) can let water all the way into the box. We
should advise people to seal that with a bead of hot glue.

This complicates things a bit because the coin magazine is supposed to be
hot-glued to the lid to keep it in place and to keep the water out. Using
hot glue to seal the 'ears' would mean you cannot easily remove the lid to
reload the coin magazine. It's a problem. I'll think on it some more and
try to come up with a good retrofit solution, something that can be done
easily with materials that are in your average home. The most likely
solution will involve fashioning some kind of gasket.

Let me know if you get feedback on the power write-up from Joe.

I can easily put together instructions for the 12V system. I just need to
recommend one part from Amazon, which I think costs $9. You can also buy
them off-the-shelf at auto parts stores, so that's cool.

uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">As we discussed, running a CrowBox from a power b=
ank would require a power bank without &quot;auto off&quot; functionality. =
Almost all power banks have &quot;auto off&quot; functionality built-in, so=
 it&#39;s important to shop carefully in order to find a power bank which w=
ill work for our needs. The feature we&#39;re looking for is sometimes call=
ed &quot;always on&quot; mode, sometimes called &quot;no auto shut off&quot=
; mode and at other times called &quot;low power charging&quot; mode. You m=
ay have to search using all three terms to find a suitable power bank.</p>

uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">My testing process was simple: Hook a CrowBox up =
to each power bank to see how long the bank would power the CrowBox before =
hitting the low-voltage cutoff. I also used an external ammeter to double-c=
heck the actual power delivery of each power bank against its rated capacit=
y. The ammeter I used features an isolated power supply so that I could be =
sure the ammeter itself wasn&#39;t consuming any of the battery power.=C2=

uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;"><b>NOTE:=C2=A0</b>While the Xiaomi advertises a &=
quot;low power charging&quot; mode, which is what we want, this power bank =
will only operate in &#39;low power&#39; mode for two hours, which means th=
at the Xiaomi power bank failed my testing and=C2=A0<b>is not</b>=C2=A0a go=
od choice for powering a CrowBox. This is a shame because this is an otherw=
ise high-quality power bank with high capacity and low cost. Perhaps future=
 versions will allow this power bank to run indefinitely in low-power mode =
but for now my recommendation is avoid this model for this project.=C2=A0</=

normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=
uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">So, this leaves me only one power bank to test: T=
he Voltaic Systems V15, so the rest of this post will focus on this particu=
lar power bank.</p>
<p style=3D"margin:0px;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:=
normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=

<p style=3D"margin:0px;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:=
normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=
uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">First off- the V15 has an &#39;always on&#39; cha=
rging mode which can be toggled on or off by holding the power button down =
for six seconds. Unlike the Xiaomi power bank, the V15 stays in &#39;always=
 on&#39; mode and will power the attached device until the power bank&#39;s=
 internal battery hits the low-voltage cutoff. This is perfect for us and w=
orked very well during my testing.</p>
<p style=3D"margin:0px;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:=
normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=

<p style=3D"margin:0px;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:=
normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=
uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">The V15 is rated at 4,000mAh capacity but I found=
 that the pack delivered a total of 2,559mAh before hitting the low-voltage=
 cutoff. This wasn&#39;t a complete surprise, since a rule of thumb for USB=
 power banks is to expect somewhere around 60% overall efficiency. In my te=
st case, I observed about 64% efficiency. The energy we lost was likely con=
sumed by the voltage regulator and the charge control circuitry of the powe=
r bank.</p>
<p style=3D"margin:0px;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:=

normal;font-stretch:normal;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;font-family:&q=
uot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">An idle CrowBox consumes around 45 to 46 mA of cu=
rrent, so my test CrowBox was continuously powered by the V15 for around 55=
.5 hours. So, using a V15 power bank, I&#39;d suggesting running the CrowBo=
x for no more than 48 hours before pulling the power bank to recharge it.</=

els to extend the runtime of the power bank. If your CrowBox would be set u=
p in a place that receives some sunshine each day, it&#39;s quite possible =
that a V15 power bank with a Voltaic Systems solar panel would never need t=
o be shut down or brought inside to recharge. You can buy a V15 power bank =
and 3.5 watt solar panel direct from Voltaic Systems for $69 USD, which sou=
nds like a pretty good value to me.=C2=A0</p></div><div>&lt;text ends&gt;</=
