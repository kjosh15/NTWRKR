What do you have in place for full-stack backups? I.e., if we topple =
your shed how quickly can we get back up and running?

=20

Also, we need answers for this from Liquid. Had a good convo with my =
friend who=E2=80=99s sold a few ITSec companies (and is now CISO on =
another) and it looks like we should be able to do penn testing =
internally. He also knew a lot about SOC2 - he just recently ran did his =
third round of compliance testing for his current company- and suggested =
we ringfence as tightly as possible around the application itself, which =
is what it sounds like we=E2=80=99re doing.=20

=20

His take was that at our scale we just need to tick the boxes; Bechtel =
is likely to understand our scale until we get big enough to need the =
full audit, and even then there=E2=80=99s a lot of =E2=80=9Cshow me the =
list of things that you=E2=80=99re planning to fix=E2=80=9D vs =
=E2=80=9Clet me make sure nothing is broken.=E2=80=9D

=20

He=E2=80=99s also going to intro me to a friend who just left a big firm =
focused on conduct risk and analytics who are always looking for =
additive measures to see if we could offer our services.

=20

All good news,

Josh
