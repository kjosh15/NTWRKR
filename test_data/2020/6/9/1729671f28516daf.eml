Can you please ask Wells Fargo:

- Can we deposit the IRA funds directly into a Wells Fargo IRA? We'd
requested the check be for a beneficiary IRA, but because we're traveling
cannot wait for a reissue.

- Similarly, do you support Solo 401k's? We may need to take a Solo 401k
loan to support our business later this year and would want to make sure
these funds were available that way.

Thank you,
Josh
