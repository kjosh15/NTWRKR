My story is very much like Joe's. I built my box last summer without
difficulty (the videos are excellent and I too watched them all before
starting to build). The electronics seem to be working fine.

I'm in central Massachusetts. Last fall I began my attracting-crows effort
with a simple platform about the size of the Crowbox that I placed in the
intended location. I did not have much success over a few months until I
had a mouse infestation in my car     which ended up providing some
irresistible treats (no catch and release here). Once I got the crows
(there are three of them) hooked I switched back to peanuts with some
success. Eventually though the crows learned the peanuts would almost
always blow off the platform and they could just eat off the ground, which
they seemed to prefer. They might leave a peanut on the platform for days
waiting for it to blow off. I considered rebuilding the platform, but
decided to just install the crow box itself instead. The box has now been
out for about a month and I have yet to witness a crow landing on it. I'll
keep working on it, and try some more enticing tidbits, but I'm curious if
the north Eastern crows are just a little more cautious than the Seattle
crows.  I also live in a rural area where there might be more food
available? That said, they do fly by every morning to check fo grounded
peanuts.

Any suggestions are welcome but mostly I wanted to report in.

Keep at it everyone.

Carrie

<div><div dir=3D"auto">My story is very much like Joe&#39;s. I built my box=
 last summer without difficulty (the videos are excellent and I too watched=
 them all before starting to build). The electronics seem to be working fin=

n central Massachusetts. Last fall I began my attracting-crows effort with =
a simple platform about the size of the Crowbox that I placed in the intend=
ed location. I did not have much success over a few months until I had a mo=
use infestation in my car =C2=A0 =C2=A0 which ended up providing some irres=
istible treats (no catch and release here). Once I got the crows (there are=
 three of them) hooked I switched back to peanuts with some success. Eventu=
ally though the crows learned the peanuts would almost always blow off the =
platform and they could just eat off the ground, which they seemed to prefe=
r. They might leave a peanut on the platform for days waiting for it to blo=
w off. I considered rebuilding the platform, but decided to just install th=
e crow box itself instead. The box has now been out for about a month and I=
 have yet to witness a crow landing on it. I&#39;ll keep working on it, and=
 try some more enticing tidbits, but I&#39;m curious if the north Eastern c=
rows are just a little more cautious than the Seattle crows.=C2=A0 I also l=
