Spoke to their EVP today, did a walkthrough of our platform and got one of
theirs. They've got a very robust surveying solution that, honestly, I
thought would work well for stuff like SOC2 compliance - lots and lots and
lots of questions broken down in infinitesimal detail with backup
documentation and responsibility trails, etc.

That said, they purport to measure ethics (hence the name) and seem to be
interested in how they could use our data processing to enhance theirs.
They were clear they wouldn't be able to take anything like this on until
the fall due to other projects currently in their pipeline, but were def.
interested.

They're going to discuss internally and then set another meeting with
another of their team - I'd like to bring you in on the next one.

Onwards!
