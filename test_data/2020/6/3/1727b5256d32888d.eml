Makes sense. What's the timeline looking like for Ellipses? Can't imagine
it can extend too much longer, no?

Outside of that my suggestions were all about compromise on cost; if
there's no flex then yes let's look to other engagements. Right now I'm
pushing a couple healthcare providers for a project around CGMs / personal
data, and am still trying to crack the nut on COVID testing at the airport
in Iceland. You have any other projects that are a little further out that
I might be able to help reel in?
