Completed and tested the box. I set a thick PVC pipe in a Home Depot bucket
with concrete at 5 ft -- high enough to discourage squirrels but low enough
to operate. Surrounded by trees so the crows can observe, but I worry that
it's too out of the way. Starting with just peanuts before wiring the box
to the site. Problem is that I need to be near AC power. So I'm wondering
how much power the box draws and if you have a suggestion on going on some
kind of battery power, perhaps replacing power packs daily. That would
allow me more freedom to place it.

I also bought a $40 hunting cam and locked it to the platform with a cheap
lock. It would be nice to have wifi but that's not available unless I
install an old iphone and run it continuously as a hotspot on an unlimited
plan.

I'm planning to write a note to the group, offering spare parts. I'm having
a meeting Saturday at noon to introduce the local kids to the box. Maybe
they can create a website and help document it.
