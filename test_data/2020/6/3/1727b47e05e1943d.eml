If you were shooting for "intriguing and mysterious" you hit it in spades
with yesterday's call - it sounds as though you're working on some really
amazing stuff! I walked away with three big threads:

1. The biggest was using group dynamics to drive individual behavior
changes through personalized data. This is super rich, and I've been
chatting with my cofounder about some ways it could be implemented. Happy
to pull him in for a larger conversation if you're interested.

2. CGMs: it sounds as though you have a lab in place to do studies, and are
already looking closely at biometric / QS data. My conversations with
insurers and manufacturers have shown a really big appetite in this space,
with a couple contacts asking directly for help in setting up studies. If
this is of interest to Sutter I'd love to facilitate some larger
discussions.

3. QS + interface design. I spent Q3/Q4 last year setting up the tech
strategy for IDEO here in NYC, and in the process got to look really
closely at a number of medical devices/platforms/etc. I'd love to dig into
some of the design work you're doing if you'd like another brain to take a
look. My first startup was a wearable so I've been keeping an eye on the
space for the last couple decades, and am super passionate about the
potential for game-changing lifestyle shifts through better
interface/integrations of personal data!

Let me know if you're game for a followup conversation on any of the above,
and/or tell me more about the design group you'd asked me to speak to about
my CGM experience!
