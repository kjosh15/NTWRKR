This is amazing!! Yes, you should be able to use a car battery - we
designed the system for this, so check the docs and see if there's a
reference and if not let me know. LOVE the idea of getting local kids
involved, and especially stoked you've got a camera up. As for location,
there's only one good way to find out, and note that it may change - we had
a premo location for a while but then a hawk moved in next store and the
gig was up. Congrats on getting this all together. I'm so so stoked!!!

Many many thanks and keep me posted!
