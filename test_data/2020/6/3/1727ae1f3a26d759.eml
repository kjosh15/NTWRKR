Craig,

Pleasure speaking with you this morning - after seeing your platform I can
think of a dozen different ways we might be able to integrate our data
sources. Have a think on where you think you might see the greatest benefit
and let's reconnect; next time I'd like to bring in my cofounder to add to
the conversation.

All best,
Josh
