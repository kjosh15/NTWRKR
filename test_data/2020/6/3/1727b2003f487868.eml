Just following up. We're currently onboarding Bechtel, who want to bring
soft skills much more to the forefront. We're curious what they think that
is, and are pretty sure they don't know how to tell their employees about
it.

Once they're up and running we'd like to introduce BSS to them, for which
it would be helpful to have your team using the platform. Let us know where
you stand on the JV terms/language and if/how we can push this forward!

All best,
Josh
