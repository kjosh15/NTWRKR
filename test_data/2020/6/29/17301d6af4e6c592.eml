Betsy,

I've been thinking a lot about our last coffee conversation and the
potential new framing for Ella Baker given demand for remote learning
ongoing. What struck me most was that in this time of crisis, access to
quality remote learning is spiraling away fastest from those that need it
most.

I took the liberty of contacting my good friend Scott Sherman, founder of
the Transformative Action Institute <https://transformativeaction.org/>, to
ask him for his thoughts. At the same time, we reached out to another
Queens family who work at Avenues: The World School
<https://www.avenues.org>, which is rapidly becoming the remote learning
school of choice for many of my affluent NYC-based clients' kids.

It turns out that Scott's institute helped design the World School's
curriculum some years ago, and that he's now launching a new project
focused on equity by addressing racial and economic inequality.

He's going to introduce me to his partner in this effort to compare notes
and learn more, but I was hoping we three could connect before then. I've
no idea if this would/could be helpful, but one thing is clear: remote
learning is going to be in high demand for some time to come, and the
highest quality curriculums currently available strongly favor the rich.

We joined Ella Baker because we believed in the mission, and we still do.
Now more than ever it seems that there is an opportunity to fill the void
in remote learning by addressing inequality head on. I believe that if we
do this right, we can create a new model that takes the best aspects of
high-quality remote learning and marries it to the finest aspects of the
Ella Baker School.

If we do, we can create a curriculum that isn't just available to all, but
which elevates all, equally.

Let me know what you think!
- J
