My notes from our meeting with Othinn this morning about a summer schedule:

Go outside 2x / day
breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner
morning routine. evening routine
30m paper learning
30m paper reading

one hour outside =3D 1/2 hour on the computer, twice a day.

more fun stuff to do outside:
dirt bike

hang gliding
bird watching (identifying and logging)
foraging
lupina harvesting
tree climbing
