Thanks for writing, and congratulations on your work so far! Please do send
video when you get a chance.

From what you wrote I think I understand the problem. The crow is not
sitting on the box when it makes noise, correct?

If so, there are a few options:

- try a different location. Groups of young crows (from families or unmated
groups) are generally braver. So are hungrier crows.
- try putting out cheetoes or crunchy, bright-colored snacks in addition to
peanuts.
- Change the timing on the crow box so it makes noise longer after the crow
has retrieved a nut.
- Be more patient. If the bird is feeding from the box, they will
eventually get used to it. But it can take a long time!

The general idea is to get the crows more frequently exposed to the sound
of the box opening so they know it's not a threat. Let me know if any of
these ideas help or if I can provide more detail!
