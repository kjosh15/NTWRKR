Hulda already connected, but I was wondering if we could do a brief video
conf for me to get your take on approaching employment in Iceland. We've
yet to make any firm decisions, but I always like to cover my bets and
would love to hear your thoughts on what works, what to watch out for, etc.
etc.

Hope you and yours are all doing well!
Josh
