so happy to continue the conversation on the permeable organization. It&#39=
;s a little bit antithetical to the framework you&#39;re currently working =

you&#39;ll be able to prompt organic growth directionally in some really po=
werful ways. <br></div><div><br></div><div>All best,<br></div><div>Josh</di=
