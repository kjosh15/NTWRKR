Thanks so much, Scott!

Hello Josh,

I'm so pleased to connect with you. Let's schedule a video call sometime to
get acquainted if this is a good time for you.

I am very interested in learning more about what you're doing and figuring
out if I can provide or direct you to resources.

Looking forward,

Andrew Young
