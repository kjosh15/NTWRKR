Very true about plywood - sorry to hear you suffered through that.

The videos show very typical bird behavior. They are very afraid of new
things, so it may be it just takes a long time.

Two other ideas:

- If you can put the box higher up the birds may be more comfortable.
Corvids are not good fliers, so being on the ground means they're under
more threat from predators like foxes, dogs, cats, etc.
- The bottle in the video may be a problem. It is shiny and unnatural; both
characteristics birds do not like. If you can, try removing it and see if
that helps.

The crowbox is ongoing, but slow. Covid-19 has caused more people to be
interested, but as we are all volunteers it's a lot of work just
coordinating.

Thanks so much for your work on this project; let us know how else we can
help!
- Josh
