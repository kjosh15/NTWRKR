Sounds good. Let me know if there's a date/time that works for you;
otherwise I'll ping you after the 4th to set a time.

Yes, we made it to Iceland. Super, super weird being here as it's
essentially as though Covid never happened - no distancing, no quarantine,
all restaurants and shops are open, and everyone is acting just like this
time last year. The airlines and tourist industry is throwing the doors
open July 1, however, so we'll see how that goes. General opinion is that
the high degree of social conformity, widespread adoption of
track-and-trace, and crystal clear leadership by scientists leading policy
will continue to suppress it and help evolve useful processes going
forward. The big question for my family now is what to do at the end of the
summer. :)

How about you? Adapting? What's evolved, and how is the family?

All best,
Josh
