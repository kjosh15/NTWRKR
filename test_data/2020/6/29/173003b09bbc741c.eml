Going to talk to a diabetes startup cofounder who does a lot of consulting
in the space to get a reality check on the approach. Simplified it over the
weekend:

"We want to skip trying to make the CGM's data perfect, and instead focus
on where the data we do have can have an impact on obesity."

I.e., let's look at how the human interaction with the data CGMs currently
provide can create behavior change.

I'll let you know what I learn!
