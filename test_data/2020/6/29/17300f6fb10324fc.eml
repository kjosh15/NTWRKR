Josh!  ICELAND?!?  You are a very smart human - which I knew before so this
is just further confirmation.

I am on the verge of leaving the Bay Area to relocate to our family home on
Cape Cod.  Still working for IDEO, just moving someplace lower cost to hole
up (as you say) and see how things unfold.  Ye gods.

I would love a quick call, but would like to do so when I land :). I'll
ping you then.  xox
