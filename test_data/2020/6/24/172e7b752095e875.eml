g with collaboration both he and his HR manager will know that he's scoring v=
ery low on the Collaboration value (because they both see it in the graphs),=
 but because the graph is relative to the group there is no number to argue o=
ver. Instead, it's simply a reflection of the reality of the perception of J=
ohn's peers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this way, because we're focus=
ed on the employee first, conversations with HR around good/bad fit challeng=
es are a matter of both the employee and employer dealing with what *is*, ve=
rsus what is perceived. In practice these measures are never a surprise, but=
 by having a statistical model it precludes the usual "he said/she said" dis=
putes and shifts the conversation to relative velocities of change.&nbsp;</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>In practice we've found that this leads to a lot more=
 proactivity on the part of employees: they know how their soft skills, beha=
viors, and beliefs are being perceived, they know their managers also see th=
e same reality, and they know how fast (or slow) those numbers are changing a=
nd in which direction they're trending. This means that the employees who wa=
nt to improve have reason and context to ask for help directly... and those w=
ho don't know sooner that they need to make other plans.&nbsp;</div><div>&nb=
