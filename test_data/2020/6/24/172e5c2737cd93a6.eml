I'd really like to crack the nut of nurturing positive emergent behaviors -
i.e., isolating elements correlated with core values and enhancing them,
plus identifying subsidiary behaviors / understandings of the values which
are correlated with group coherence and bringing them forward.

You make a really great point about the software defining the culture vs.
vice versa - I think Slack is an excellent example of this. It's widely
hated/required/desired for exactly this reason.

Is there a way we can use text as a more measurable metric for
isolating/identifying these elements? I.e., can vocabulary be
correlated with values? Might be worth looking at NLP to see if we can
build a module for this. Would be pretty cool if we could say "run
IndigoMetrics for three months and we'll give you a bot which literally
speaks your best language."

Thoughts?
