Chris,

I'm assuming you've been playing with

https://aws.amazon.com/config/

and

https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/

and/or

https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/faq/#Compliance_Reports

and wanted to see how useful you thought their reports were before I dug
into them myself. Config in particular might be a good first step forward
towards a better DevOps process in the interim.

Any thoughts?
- J
