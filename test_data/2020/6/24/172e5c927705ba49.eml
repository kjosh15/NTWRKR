Brilliant. I'd also like to pitch it to Oscar, an insurance provider with a
huge focus on UX/UI and telemedicine, based in NYC. Lots of targets here,
especially as part of a consortium, if a single buyer (like Sutter) doesn't
bite. Can also see scaling this out to other wearables to isolate a
semiotic of design for the device class - AFAIK all the work being done in
this area is over-targeted. I.e., "let's see if this device can do X"
instead of "out of all the controllable elements of this device, which
combinations/interactions produce what behaviors?"

I'm soft pitching this to an SVP at Marsh tomorrow at 9:30am EST. Let me
know if you have any time before/after!

Finally, I'm also curious to push you on remote leadership; at your level
it seems slightly absurd, but understanding better how/why f2f is
specifically important for the kinds of roles you're after might reveal
some interesting new avenues - esp. given the bizarre range of feedback I'm
seeing from senior level recruiters and online job ads.

All best,
Josh
