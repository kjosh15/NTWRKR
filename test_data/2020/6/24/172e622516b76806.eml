Our current lease was extended through Sept. 30, 2020. I suggest the
following timeline:

July 1: Tell them they need to give us our lease renewal offer now.
Aug 1: Tell them to use our security deposit to cover the lease for the
next two months.

This way we can push them on lease terms (or gather evidence that they
haven't given us one) prior to dropping the deposit request on them. Let me
know if you have any thoughts!

xoxo,
Josh
