Chris,

Been digging through some of the compliance info for AWS and think we'd =
be well served to move to as light an AWS layer as possible as soon as =
possible. Note this doesn't mean to skip where we're at now - an AWS =
hosted instance for the front and back end makes good sense given our =
current number of clients.=20

But moving to a lighter front end, where we're not hosting a VM but =
rather an application, means that Amazon picks up a lot more of the =
support/security lift. This means we're responsible for the application =
security and data, only. Lambda never looked more interesting.

Similarly for our backend infrastructure - if we can move most of it to =
a dynamic data store and API (with AWS doing all the email sourcing) our =
attack surface decreases significantly. Based on our conversations our =
backend application is fairly light anyway: it may be possible to trim =
it down even further to the point of being able to simply roll out new =
data models as needed.

Put another way, being responsible for an entire operating system (even =
on a VM) entails a host of security risks; patches, updates, ongoing =
configuration tweaks, etc. Reducing that load to an application further =
decreases our risk and makes rolling out new versions even easier. Worth =
thinking about!

- J
