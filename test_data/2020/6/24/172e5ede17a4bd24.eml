Good news all around. We made it to Iceland late last week; they've
squashed the virus so well it's as though it never existed. No distancing,
masks, isolation... it's schizophrenic after NYC, especially as they open
up to tourism with testing at the airport + track and trace. Long story...

I've got two opps you might be interested in: www.radish.health and
DysruptLabs.com. The former I'm pretty confident in (and they're looking to
make an early stage raise) and the latter I haven't fully qualified yet -
I'd be curious to get your take on both.

Finally, I'm working to formalize the consortium idea around QS data for
embedded sensors/wearables. If you're game I'll pass you my first draft
pitch, or can circle back around after I've gotten some potential members
to beat it around a bit. To that end let me know where you net out with
Komodo - they're super interesting!!

Hope you're well,
Josh
