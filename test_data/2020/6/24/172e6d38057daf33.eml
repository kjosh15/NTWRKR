Thanks again for taking the time today; I=E2=80=99m keenly aware that you=
=E2=80=99ve got a
lot of parents with strong opinions asking for wildly different things, and
really want to make sure I=E2=80=99m being additive.

To that end, the points in our conversation that stuck most with me were:

- Extreme clarity for busy parents around exactly what=E2=80=99s due from o=
ur kids
each day and when. A checklist I can quickly look at and know what is left
for my child to complete. This is especially important in terms of letting
kids self-direct.

- support for parents in homeschooling within the EB framework. Similarly
to your point around writing being about engagement vs mechanics, as a
parent I need guidance in how to support and teach my own kids.

- Homeschooling with an EB teacher as a manager/supporter seems to be the
likely model going forward, with some kids getting more access to f2f than
others at different times. If that is the case, how can you start from a
100% at-home digital framework and work backwards?

I.e., can you create a fully digital framework / set of platforms kids and
parents can choose from which are congruent ongoing with the curriculum of
the classroom? That way I as a parent can give my child a set of choices to
pursue their own education and know that they=E2=80=99ll be supported and a=
ligned
with their class and teacher.

And finally, would love to hear more about language immersion options and
how they might integrate with the ongoing EB curriculum!!

Thanks again for doing an absolutely stellar job this year,

- J

P.s., let me know about that new title - I think the bucket on parent
liaison is the new front line!!
