Chris,

Been digging through some of the compliance info for AWS and think we'd be
well served to move to as light an AWS layer as possible as soon as
possible. Note this doesn't mean to skip where we're at now - an AWS hosted
instance for the front and back end makes good sense given our current
number of clients.

But moving to a lighter front end, where we're not hosting a VM but rather
an application, means that Amazon picks up a lot more of the
support/security lift. This means we're responsible for the application
security and data, only. Lambda never looked more interesting.

Similarly for our backend infrastructure - if we can move most of it to a
dynamic data store and API (with AWS doing all the email sourcing) our
attack surface decreases significantly. Based on our conversations our
backend application is fairly light anyway: it may be possible to trim it
down even further to the point of being able to simply roll out new data
models as needed.

Put another way, being responsible for an entire operating system (even on
a VM) entails a host of security risks; patches, updates, ongoing
configuration tweaks, etc. Reducing that load to an application further
decreases our risk and makes rolling out new versions even easier. Worth
thinking about!

- J
