le means for them to improve. In the process, management gets a statisticall=
y accurate model of where/who is leading in terms of engagement or alignment=
 for each of those values.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This means that yo=
u can decide if you want to focus on particular skills, areas of growth, val=
ues of increased import to the organization (such as innovation), etc. We su=
ggest you start with your core values to establish a baseline, and then slow=
ly add in new measures over time in response to what you learn from said bas=
eline.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, as you establish a baseline a=
nd start experimenting with different measures in response to weaknesses and=
 strengths in your organization, it becomes possible to identify patterns of=
 success - such as what sorts of strengths work best in which kinds of jobs,=
 what skills are needed most within different groups, and what kinds of stim=
ulus (experiences, training, material, etc.) lends itself best to create the=
 right kind of growth.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class=3D"gmail_quot=

bsolutely correct. We manage this by providing relative measures instead of a=
bsolute numbers.&nbsp;I.e., if John is struggling with collaboration both he=
 and his HR manager will know that he's scoring very low on the Collaboratio=
n value (because they both see it in the graphs), but because the graph is r=
elative to the group there is no number to argue over. Instead, it's simply a=
 reflection of the reality of the perception of John's peers.&nbsp;</div><di=
v><br></div><div>In this way, because we're focused on the employee first, c=
onversations with HR around good/bad fit challenges are a matter of both the=
 employee and employer dealing with what *is*, versus what is perceived. In p=
ractice these measures are never a surprise, but by having a statistical mod=
el it precludes the usual "he said/she said" disputes and shifts the convers=
ation to relative velocities of change.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In pr=
actice we've found that this leads to a lot more proactivity on the part of e=
mployees: they know how their soft skills, behaviors, and beliefs are being p=
erceived, they know their managers also see the same reality, and they know h=
ow fast (or slow) those numbers are changing and in which direction they're t=
rending. This means that the employees who want to improve have reason and c=
ontext to ask for help directly... and those who don't know sooner that they=
 need to make other plans.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class=3D"=
