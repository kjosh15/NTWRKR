Josh

I just talked to Tank. He wants to wait until he has some time in August bef=
ore returning to the topic and entertaining a call.  He is willing to receiv=
e a short slide deck to explain the solution / benefits. I think they could r=
eally benefit from what I understand the tool can do  but we may not have a c=
ritical  mass of people and priority to define, develop and trial.=20

So,=20

1. Do you want to share any slides at this time and if so, should I use what=
 you sent me or will you develop something else=20

2. I am willing to listen more to what the tool/ process does and share ques=
tions if you find that helpful.=20

Cheers

Van

 provide immediate and actionable means for them to improve. In the process,=
 management gets a statistically accurate model of where/who is leading in t=

>>> Finally, as you establish a baseline and start experimenting with differ=

ial, etc.) lends itself best to create the right kind of growth.

>>>=20
>>> Absolutely correct. We manage this by providing relative measures instea=
d of absolute numbers. I.e., if John is struggling with collaboration both h=
e and his HR manager will know that he's scoring very low on the Collaborati=
on value (because they both see it in the graphs), but because the graph is r=
elative to the group there is no number to argue over. Instead, it's simply a=
 reflection of the reality of the perception of John's peers.=20
>>>=20
>>> In this way, because we're focused on the employee first, conversations w=
ith HR around good/bad fit challenges are a matter of both the employee and e=
mployer dealing with what *is*, versus what is perceived. In practice these m=
easures are never a surprise, but by having a statistical model it precludes=
 the usual "he said/she said" disputes and shifts the conversation to relati=
ve velocities of change.=20
>>>=20
>>> In practice we've found that this leads to a lot more proactivity on the=
 part of employees: they know how their soft skills, behaviors, and beliefs a=
re being perceived, they know their managers also see the same reality, and t=
hey know how fast (or slow) those numbers are changing and in which directio=
n they're trending. This means that the employees who want to improve have r=
eason and context to ask for help directly... and those who don't know soone=
r that they need to make other plans.=20

t gets a statistically accurate model of where/who is leading in terms of en=

iv>This means that you can decide if you want to focus on particular skills,=
 areas of growth, values of increased import to the organization (such as in=
novation), etc. We suggest you start with your core values to establish a ba=
seline, and then slowly add in new measures over time in response to what yo=
u learn from said baseline.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, as you e=
stablish a baseline and start experimenting with different measures in respo=

 identify patterns of success - such as what sorts of strengths work best in=
 which kinds of jobs, what skills are needed most within different groups, a=
nd what kinds of stimulus (experiences, training, material, etc.) lends itse=
lf best to create the right kind of growth.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquot=

ume a fundamental premise is that the results will never be used to fire peo=

aces vs security in sharing what people observe?<br></div></div></blockquote=
><div><br></div><div>Absolutely correct. We manage this by providing relativ=
e measures instead of absolute numbers.&nbsp;I.e., if John is struggling wit=
h collaboration both he and his HR manager will know that he's scoring very l=
ow on the Collaboration value (because they both see it in the graphs), but b=
ecause the graph is relative to the group there is no number to argue over. I=
nstead, it's simply a reflection of the reality of the perception of John's p=
eers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this way, because we're focused on t=
he employee first, conversations with HR around good/bad fit challenges are a=
 matter of both the employee and employer dealing with what *is*, versus wha=
t is perceived. In practice these measures are never a surprise, but by havi=
ng a statistical model it precludes the usual "he said/she said" disputes an=
d shifts the conversation to relative velocities of change.&nbsp;</div><div>=
<br></div><div>In practice we've found that this leads to a lot more proacti=
vity on the part of employees: they know how their soft skills, behaviors, a=
nd beliefs are being perceived, they know their managers also see the same r=
eality, and they know how fast (or slow) those numbers are changing and in w=
hich direction they're trending. This means that the employees who want to i=
mprove have reason and context to ask for help directly... and those who don=
't know sooner that they need to make other plans.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</d=
