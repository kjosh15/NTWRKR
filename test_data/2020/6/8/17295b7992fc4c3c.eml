What do you have in place for full-stack backups? I.e., if we topple your
shed how quickly can we get back up and running?

Also, we need answers for this from Liquid. Had a good convo with my friend
who=E2=80=99s sold a few ITSec companies (and is now CISO on another) and i=
t looks
like we should be able to do penn testing internally. He also knew a lot
about SOC2 - he just recently ran did his third round of compliance testing
for his current company- and suggested we ringfence as tightly as possible
around the application itself, which is what it sounds like we=E2=80=99re d=
oing.

His take was that at our scale we just need to tick the boxes; Bechtel is
likely to understand our scale until we get big enough to need the full
audit, and even then there=E2=80=99s a lot of =E2=80=9Cshow me the list of =
things that
you=E2=80=99re planning to fix=E2=80=9D vs =E2=80=9Clet me make sure nothin=
g is broken.=E2=80=9D

He=E2=80=99s also going to intro me to a friend who just left a big firm fo=
cused on
conduct risk and analytics who are always looking for additive measures to
see if we could offer our services.

All good news,
Josh
