w to see how I can help you.
-08:45:39Josh:thanks!
-08:46:14Lydia (24/7 Librarian):Please give me a moment to check your libra=
ry.
-08:46:18Josh:ok!
-08:46:39Lydia (24/7 Librarian):Can you please verify your email for me in =
the meantime?
-08:47:07Josh:josh@josh.is, why?
-08:47:32Lydia (24/7 Librarian):Just in case I have to send a message to yo=
ur local librarians for email follow up.
