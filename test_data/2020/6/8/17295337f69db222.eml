Josh,

Thanks for the time last week and bringing this all to Carl's attention.
While at AD we have a few COVID focused initiatives such as test kit
tracking, and medical item use tracking for direct medical applications. We
also have an initiative with the Google team and the LiA product for
helping shoppers prepare for a visit and frictionless retail options. These
solutions do not feel like the direct hit you are looking for with Carl in
the short term. We do however feel that there are changes happening to the
supply chain such as seasonless fashion, compounding of disrupting
activities due to climate and politics alike, practices that will drive
over supply and surplus due to the lack of agility to adjust. We feel the
best impact we can offer Estee Lauder is a longer term view centered on
defined and clear data paths supported by data confidence and visibility.
If there is a short term opportunity for us to help drive something forward
we will commit, but it looks clear that our role is helping to set the
foundation to position the company to be more agile in the future. I will
put together a short deck over the next week and a half to outline this
view and sync back.

all the best to you and thanks for your support.

Fred

<div dir=3D"ltr">Josh,<div><br></div><div>Thanks for the time last week and=
 bringing this all to Carl&#39;s attention. While at AD we have a few COVID=
 focused initiatives such as test kit tracking, and medical item use tracki=
ng for direct medical applications. We also have an initiative=C2=A0with th=
e Google team and the LiA product for helping shoppers prepare for a visit =
and frictionless retail options. These solutions do not feel like the direc=
t hit you are looking for with Carl in the short term. We do however feel t=
hat there are changes happening to the supply chain such as seasonless fash=
ion, compounding of disrupting activities due to climate and politics alike=
, practices that will drive over supply and surplus due to the lack of agil=
ity to adjust. We feel the best impact we can offer Estee Lauder is a longe=
r term view centered on defined and clear data paths supported by data conf=
idence and visibility. If there is a short term opportunity for us to help =
drive something=C2=A0forward we will commit, but it looks clear that our ro=
le is helping to set the foundation to position the company to be more agil=
e in the future. I will put together a short deck over the next week and a =
half to outline this view and sync back.</div><div><br></div><div>all the b=
