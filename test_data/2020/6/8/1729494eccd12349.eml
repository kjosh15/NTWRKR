All good; I ordered a mouse and we'll make do. ;)

We're trying to get to Iceland now as they've cancelled our tickets, but
they refuse to rebook until within 48 hours of the original date. So... we
don't know when we're leaving. Exciting times!

How about you guys? Surviving well? Word is you're back in the hood and in
the office - how's that going??

All best and looking forward to sharing a beer at some point!
