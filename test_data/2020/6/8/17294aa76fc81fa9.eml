&gt; Hey there. Hope you=E2=80=99re doing well too. The cutting boards have n=
ow been joined by knife making, mask sewing, some light carpentry, and leath=
er work. We may have a Renaissance Fair going on in my driveway soon.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I=E2=80=99d be happy to chat about that. I=E2=80=99ve been holding a me=
eting with a bunch of CISOs every few weeks during the pandemic, and it=E2=80=
=99s been interesting to see that most of them are leading the COVID respons=
e for the company even tho the risks go far beyond cyber. I think it=E2=80=99=
s for a variety of reasons (CISO=E2=80=99s natively are risk managers, they h=
ave structured incident response plans, they have good eyes on employees and=
 their behavior (to your ask)=E2=80=A6) So I=E2=80=99ll have some data point=
s I can share for sure.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; let me know when you want to chat.<br>

&gt; &gt; First, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy. I've been passin=
g on that link about the cutting boards. Awesome project!!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Separately, the startup I've been working on to quantify behavior a=
nd belief in employees has been getting a lot of traction in the pandemic. O=
ne of the things I'm trying to figure out is if conduct risk is being bucket=
ed as a cyber threat given the prevelance of remote working now. Do you have=
 a few minutes to quickly discuss in the next week or two?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; All best,<br>
