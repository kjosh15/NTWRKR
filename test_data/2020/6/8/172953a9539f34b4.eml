y well. A missing element is the revenue share for any IM contracts signed =
through our relationships and/or efforts that I mentioned in my email of xx=
x that replaced all the complexity of equity and long-term what-if scenario=
s. Also, we&#39;ll need to add more definition to the scope of our services=
 to you - as written it could vary wildly.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I=
&#39;ve been doing my best to understand any precedent for these types of r=
evenue shares, but they vary tremendously and all options have pros and con=
s. It&#39;s fundamentally a question of being worth everyone&#39;s while to=
 do it and what we&#39;re all comfortable with and what we might not be. To=
 get there I propose that we get 20% of the first year of any contract that=
 comes through Big Spaceship and 10% of the second year. If the customer in=
creases their contract above a certain threshold, it kicks in again and we =
get 20% of year 1 of the expanded contract and 10% of year 2. This is to ac=
count for the cases where we might start with a group within a larger org a=
nd then it expands to another group or company wide. From what I&#39;ve bee=
n reading on the economics of SaaS, it seems like that is neither greedy no=
