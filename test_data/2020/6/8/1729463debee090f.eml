Really sorry about missing this. We had our first actual security incident e=
arly this morning. Nothing huge but enough to cause us to spin up all our in=
ternal IR machinery. Just winding down from that now and coming off the adre=
naline rush and getting my head screwed back on straight.=20

Any time late this afternoon or anytime tomorrow afternoon?
