Things have changed substantially since last we spoke!! The good news on
the topic of school exchange is that, at least in NYC, it's very likely
that a virtual option will be available going forward at parent's
discretion. This means that there's a lot more flex for students and their
families to come and stay for variable amounts of time while staying
enrolled at their school in NYC.

On your end, what kinds of classes/engagements can you offer? How much
flexibility is available for zoom meetings and online coursework to happen
in conjunction with the language work? Really excited to get your take on
all this as I see it as a bright light in terms of travel and cultural
transmission in an otherwise dark time for both!!

All best wishes; I hope you and yours are safe and healthy!
- J

<div>Cath, pleasure to meet you! I&#39;ve been working with my son&#39;s sc=
hool (<a href=3D"http://ellabakerschool.org/" target=3D"_blank">ellabakersc=
hool.org</a>) to create better spanish language options - it&#39;s one of t=
he most diverse schools in Manhattan,
 but it recently had to slash its existing language courses because of budg=
et issues. Rather than have one hour of spanish language per week, I&#39;m =
trying to find a way for a small cohort of students to do a longer immersio=
n once a year, the idea being that they&#39;ll
 get a better leg up on the language (which is pervasive in NYC) as well as=
 have a deep social and cultural experience within which to relate to it. C=
an you tell me more about the exchange program you set up and how it&#39;s =
structured?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Many many thanks, all!<br>

<div>Actually my wife Cath produces a two week exchange program with NYU ar=
