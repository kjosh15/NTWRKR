Just got to Iceland; international travel is absolutely bizarre. Hope you
like N95's!! ;)

Looking forward to hearing which projects spin up in this environment -
it's definitely a new operating space. And I love your thinking around how
to do a remote version of the show about new tech; I'd never thought of
doing that, but you're right - some really edgy graphics and post tech
could level it up in a new way (which is likely to become *the* new way) of
doing TV. What do you think would be required, and would the channels bite?

Hope you're well,
- J
