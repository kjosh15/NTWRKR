Was on a call today w/ Juan Enriquez, a highly respected investor and
geneticist who's been doing a lot of update calls on the science of the
pandemic for a bunch of executives I know.

His last call is pretty nicely summed up by the attached. I.e., did you say
you knew any recruiters in Germany?

All best,
Josh
