Made it to Iceland!! One of the weirder trips of my life, for sure - 29
hours in an N95, followed by a COVID test at the border and then some
interesting track-and-trace for results... Worth a conversation all on its
own at some point!

In the meantime, I was curious if you had any thoughts on my original
query. Let me know if it's worth a quick call regarding!

I hope you and yours are doing well,
Josh
