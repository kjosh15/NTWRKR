  Hello Neighbors!

*Weekly Actions:*

*Media Blast!*
In May, we sent a letter to management requesting repairs. We gave them a
deadline of June 25th to send us a repair plan and/or contact individuals.
This *has not happened*, so we now need to start taking further action.

This means that we need to *as a group* make management hear us. We are
asking you to participate in any way you can in the next week,
specifically *this
weekend*.

Call, leave Google reviews, email, and tweet,* the more participation the
better* for the goal of getting management to pay attention to our needs. This
flier
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNFzFQAJEJy11Ifb70lXckk-65x5TyB1/view?usp=sharing>
 gives you all the information you need about how and who to contact.

*Reviews:*

Send a message you would want shared about your experience of living in our
building to hayescourtreviews@gmail.com and you can see them in the next
few days by visiting hayescourtreviews.wordpress.com

*Building Updates:*

*Heat and Hot Water!*

We have been able to get an inspection on the boilers over the last week
from the Tenant Advocate of the City so you may have seen their citations
on the gates. You can read the reports here for 33-53 82nd Street
<http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&vlcompdetlkey=0002568741>
 and here for 33-54 83rd Street
<http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&vlcompdetlkey=0002566869>.
To summarize, they are issuing our landlord a summons to appear in court
for the disrepair of our building as well as the boilers for both buildings
being inoperative and defective.

*Picnic!*

It was great seeing so many of you out in the courtyard! We thought this
was great for our new tenants as well as helping us feel a bit more like a
community. We want to host another picnic soon since this was such a
success and we could host another social distancing picnic at some point in
the next 3 weeks. Please let us know at Tuesday night's meeting what dates
would work best and we'll email out when it will be for the group.

Cheers,
Your Neighbors/ Hayes Court United
