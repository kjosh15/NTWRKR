Hello, my name is Rodion.I'm from Russia. I am a student of the children's
Technopark. I was looking for an idea for my project and decided to make a
project related to the vranovs. And I came across your interesting
invention. I put together a similar box made of plywood and varnished it.
And he settled it first in his city next to the crows, later they made a
nest next to it. But the project did not go there because of the large
number of garbage cans rich in RZ leftovers and they were not interested in
Boxing. Later I came to the village for the summer. And there I installed a
box. And then the corvids have shown an interest. Most often it has come
Pica pica. In the first stage, everything was fine and they ate peanuts.
And on the second, she began to be afraid to sit on the box. I started
gluing peanuts on the lid of the box. She managed to pull it off by sitting
on the end of the box and reaching for them. And I made a Choba bar for
this purpose when the crow sat down it pressed this bar and the box opened.
But while afraid of this installation and start sitting on the lid, but
still afraid of the sound of opening the lid. I'm also going to build a new
box made of plexiglass and put it in a different place for more coverage of
the enemy. For more information, see my Facebook blog @CrowChallenge. Might
have something to recommend or advise? You can contact me by email -
rodion.mutsolgov@gmail.com thank you very much.
