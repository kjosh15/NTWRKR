Josh,

Thank you for your patience!

Upon further review, it appears that you already have a request open with our CDN/WAF partner, Sucuri.  I have since reached out to our partners at Sucuri and they will be updating your ticket shortly.  You can access your Sucuri Support Requests via the AccountCenter:

AccountCenter > Security Dashboard > Help (Top Right Corner) > Ticket ID: 15912023941927

Essentially the Firewall has yet to be activated for kravmaga.fithit.com.  To utilize the free SSL included with the CDN/WAF service, you must first activate it. 

However in order to activate the Firewall, you must first point DNS for kravmaga.fithit.com to the Firewall IP address, 192.124.249.106.  This will be done via the zone file for the parent domain, fithit.com.  For instructions on updating your DNS records, please see the following link:

How can I change the DNS records for my domain?
