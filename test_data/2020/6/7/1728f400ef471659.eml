We're getting ready to head to Iceland and I've set up Destiny 2 and
Warframe on my gaming laptop, only to discover that I gave away my
controllers along with my old xbox. Do you have any older Xbox One, Xbox
360 or PS4 controllers you could sell me? I'm making a big bet that Hulda
will let this one slide, but at the very least I'd like to be able to play
while we're out in the forest!! Let me know if you have any tips.

Many thanks!
Josh
