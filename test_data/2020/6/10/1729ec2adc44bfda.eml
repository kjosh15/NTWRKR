I'm digging into this a bit today - after some
adrenaline-fueled conversations with Icelandair this morning we have
tickets for a 20 hour flight to Iceland on the 15th. Americans aren't
allowed in the country, so we'll see if we can get back in August...

In terms of Penetration Testing, I think we may need to make a choice about
how we want security to be run once we move to the cloud. See:

https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/pen-testing-cloud-based-apps-step-step=
-guide

I.e., testing a cloud instance involves a lot more care and feeding as you
can easily shut down your service if you misstep.

The guy I spoke to yesterday (who's sold a couple ITSEC companies) built
this:

https://info.expel.io/expel-self-scoring-tool-for-nist-csf

Which might be helpful for explaining ourselves to Bechtel. (It also lets
us name drop Bruce and the tool, which could build confidence.) Do you
think the graphs this would produce would be worth it? Not sure how much
this overlaps / is additive to what Bechtel has asked of us so far - I'm
not by any means suggesting we do this if it doesn't directly improve our
chances of finalizing Bechtel approval.

In the short term, I'm hoping to get some basic testing on the UAT rolling
later today, but note that they won't include a broad swath of testing
elements like social engineering, etc. Still, if it gets us a starting
point to push Liquid to cover some basics it'll be worth it. I'll let you
know what I come up with!
