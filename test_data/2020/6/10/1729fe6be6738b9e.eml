Chris,

Initial results + pentest logic is available in this document
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ho5YWfHbA2lf-f6rnHXVv1zGn-U4mHhQ1cNOJM=
cRHFM/edit?usp=3Dsharing>,
with results listed in the documents it links to. Liquid should review the
following items for inclignuat.rivel.com:

+ The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
+ The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. This header can hint to the
user agent to protect against some forms of XSS
+ The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. This could allow the user
agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME
type

As well as results listed here:

http://h4xindustries.com/TEMP/TEMPTEMP/zap_scan_output_https.html
http://h4xindustries.com/TEMP/TEMPTEMP/watipi_results_https/inclignuat.rive=
l.com_06102020_1249.html

This is all a bit quick and dirty, but overall my initial "run everything
that's automated at it" scan looks surprisingly good! Let me know if you
think we can munge the attached documents into something that will satisfy
Bechtel for round one - after that I think you're right that we ought to
pay someone for a scan of our AWS setup; there are too many fidgety ways to
get blacklisted by AWS if I'm trying to do this myself.

All best,
Josh
