 you learn from said baseline.=20

>>>>>=20
>>>>> Absolutely correct. We manage this by providing relative measures inst=
ead of absolute numbers. I.e., if John is struggling with collaboration both=
 he and his HR manager will know that he's scoring very low on the Collabora=
tion value (because they both see it in the graphs), but because the graph i=
s relative to the group there is no number to argue over. Instead, it's simp=

>>>>>=20
>>>>> In this way, because we're focused on the employee first, conversation=
s with HR around good/bad fit challenges are a matter of both the employee a=
nd employer dealing with what *is*, versus what is perceived. In practice th=
ese measures are never a surprise, but by having a statistical model it prec=
ludes the usual "he said/she said" disputes and shifts the conversation to r=
elative velocities of change.=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> In practice we've found that this leads to a lot more proactivity on t=
he part of employees: they know how their soft skills, behaviors, and belief=
s are being perceived, they know their managers also see the same reality, a=
nd they know how fast (or slow) those numbers are changing and in which dire=
ction they're trending. This means that the employees who want to improve ha=

lues, and to provide immediate and actionable means for them to improve. In t=
he process, management gets a statistically accurate model of where/who is l=
eading in terms of engagement or alignment for each of those values.&nbsp;</=
div><div><br></div><div>This means that you can decide if you want to focus o=
n particular skills, areas of growth, values of increased import to the orga=
nization (such as innovation), etc. We suggest you start with your core valu=
es to establish a baseline, and then slowly add in new measures over time in=
 response to what you learn from said baseline.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>Finally, as you establish a baseline and start experimenting with differe=
nt measures in response to weaknesses and strengths in your organization, it=
 becomes possible to identify patterns of success - such as what sorts of st=
rengths work best in which kinds of jobs, what skills are needed most within=
 different groups, and what kinds of stimulus (experiences, training, materi=
al, etc.) lends itself best to create the right kind of growth.</div><div>&n=

v></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Absolutely correct. We manage this b=
y providing relative measures instead of absolute numbers.&nbsp;I.e., if Joh=
n is struggling with collaboration both he and his HR manager will know that=
 he's scoring very low on the Collaboration value (because they both see it i=
n the graphs), but because the graph is relative to the group there is no nu=
mber to argue over. Instead, it's simply a reflection of the reality of the p=
erception of John's peers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this way, becau=
se we're focused on the employee first, conversations with HR around good/ba=
d fit challenges are a matter of both the employee and employer dealing with=
 what *is*, versus what is perceived. In practice these measures are never a=
 surprise, but by having a statistical model it precludes the usual "he said=
/she said" disputes and shifts the conversation to relative velocities of ch=
ange.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In practice we've found that this leads=
 to a lot more proactivity on the part of employees: they know how their sof=
t skills, behaviors, and beliefs are being perceived, they know their manage=
rs also see the same reality, and they know how fast (or slow) those numbers=
 are changing and in which direction they're trending. This means that the e=
mployees who want to improve have reason and context to ask for help directl=
y... and those who don't know sooner that they need to make other plans.&nbs=
