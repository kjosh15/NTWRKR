Happy to loop around in August; we're in the process of working with a
design firm to redo all our materials, so I'd rather push off sending him a
deck until we have something more polished (unless you think timing is key
here.) If you think a deeper understanding of the tool would be helpful I'm
happy to schedule a followup call in the meantime!

Many thanks,
Josh
