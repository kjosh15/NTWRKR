I'm in Akureyri - let me know if you have time to briefly chat; I'd love to
get your impression of how best to leverage this time of crisis to create
change, how to use Iceland as a base of operations for EU/US collaboration,
and to get an update on the B Team and how you're growing in light of
current circumstances!

All best wishes,
Josh
