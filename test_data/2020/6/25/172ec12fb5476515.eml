This is the qual feedback that Brian's employee didn't like:

 

I particularly like this entry: "Since IncLign was rolled out among Rivel
employees, Colin has been noticeably cognizant of the way his words might
impact morale and has made strides to be kind, thoughtful and inclusive
without losing his sense of humor." 

 


Personal Feedback from your peers related to your actions in the Respectful
area.


Suggestions from your peers as to how you could improve:


Colin is a bit of a bully. Picks on people quite a bit. Recently, he has
been seemingly fighting with Brian. I didn't appreciate his "I will talk to
my people" comment on teams. I consider myself one of his people and he DOES
NOT speak for me. Seems a bit like a union boss organizing a team against
the CEO. Wasn't a good look. Brian is a good-natured guy and I think they
are friendly so I don't think that will hurt him in the long run, but if
that happened at other companies I have worked at, he would have been fired.


Examples from your peers of how you have recently improved in this area:


Colin is a bully sometimes. He puts down a lot of people at work which is
funny, but at the expense of the person he is belittling. Sometimes you can
be funny without "roasting" someone.


I don't have a lot of interaction with Colin but he has always been
respectful from my perspective.


I never had an issue with Colin. He's just a funny guy.


Colin has, since the launch of IncLign, tailored his comedic genius to be
less at the expense of colleagues and more family-friendly (but hasn't lost
the sense of humor that makes him a blast to have around). As a result, his
empathy is shining through. That said, there has never seemed to be a lack
of empathy in his communications with clients.


Since IncLign was rolled out among Rivel employees, Colin has been
noticeably cognizant of the way his words might impact morale and has made
strides to be kind, thoughtful and inclusive without losing his sense of
humor.


He is more mindful of what he says in team meetings.


Colin can be very funny, but sometimes he crosses the line.
