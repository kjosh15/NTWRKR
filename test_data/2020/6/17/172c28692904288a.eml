We made it!! Most surreal trip ever, helped by the fact that our kids took
turns sleeping so we never did. 29 hours of continuous travel by the end.

Let me know if you're up for a call next week to compare notes - I'd love
to be able to help whatever you're up to if I'm able! Now is the time to
help each other if ever there was one, and you've always been an enormous
support to me. Let me know if you're around or if it'd be useful!

All best,
Josh
