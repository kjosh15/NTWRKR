I know you never get unsolicited ideas pitched at you so I'd thought I'd do
my part to fill the void.

This one actually comes from my brother-in-law, but it's interesting as a)
it can be filmed while socially distancing, b) it uses celebrities, who may
be eager to find platforms to act on during the pandemic, and c) it uses
Legos and I know the CMO.

The concept is basic: it's a Lego building competition between stars and
their kids. I.e., Beckham, son and advisor vs Terry Crews + son/daughter +
advisor.

One challenge could be each team has 8 hours to come up with a Lego machine
that lifts a 30 kg box 2 meters up in the air. Or build a bridge that is
supposed to be able to hold a 3kg remote controlled bulldozer in 2per/sec
crosswind. etc.

Think of the Scrapheap Challenge (UK) only with Legos.

What do you think?

Hope you're safe and well,
Josh
