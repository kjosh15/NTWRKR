We made it!! 29 hours of continuous travel through the weirdest
international travel environment never imagined, but we're here. The boys
were absolutely amazing; not a single word of complaint and something like
ten miles of hauling bags through four terminals and three security
checkpoints. We are truly, truly blessed.

Lots and lots of love from the land of the midnight sun!!!

Xoxo,
Josh
