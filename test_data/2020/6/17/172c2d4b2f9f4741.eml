How did you know I never get these solicitations?? :)

While it=E2=80=99s not exactly the same=E2=80=A6.

https://www.fox.com/lego-masters/ <https://www.fox.com/lego-masters/>

This premiered on Fox within the last year. It=E2=80=99s returning as it =
did well. My guess is the world only needs one Lego show and I would =
imagine that Lego=E2=80=99s deal was that they wouldn=E2=80=99t license =
a second show to compete with this one=E2=80=A6.

Good idea though - clearly Fox liked it when it was pitched!
