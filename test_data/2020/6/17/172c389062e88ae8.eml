Nice to hear from you! It=E2=80=99s been interesting. I have been spending =
way more
time doing child care the past 3 months which is great but also mentally
exhausting. I needed to recharge my batteries. So I focused on back country
mountain biking, hiking and mushroom hunting (morels), since there is tons
of wilderness here and it=E2=80=99s easy to avoid people. So yeah past 3 mo=
nths has
been alternating between family time and alone time in the woods.

Other things I have been doing...

I have been working through a start up idea in the library and cultural
heritage institution space. Just trying to understand the market and
confirm the opportunity exists for my idea. Not sure if I will execute on
it yet. Would be happy to bounce the idea off you if you are interested.

I spent a decent amount of time learning quant connect, which is a platform
for developing, back testing and executing trading algos and strategies. I
don=E2=80=99t have delusions that I can compete with the smart money here, =
I was
mostly interested in learning what the current state of the art is.

With regards to what we talked about in NY, I am back burnering the self
branding exercise at the moment. Reason being I am having a hard time
really nailing how I want to brand myself, what my niche is. I think of my
self as generalist with an extremely broad range of interests, knowledge
and experience. Which I think is of much value to many people, but not sure
on how to package and deliver it.

Hope things are well with you!

Ken
