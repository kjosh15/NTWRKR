I had a long conversation with Viral (the founder) of Radish late last
week; they're offering testing, monitoring, and support health services for
companies and seem to be much farther along in how they're deployed. Is
this something that could be useful to World 50 members? I've attached a
brief deck if helpful.

Hope you're safe and healthy!
