Subject: Bechtel - David call

=20

Had a good call w/ David; he seems more enthused about the platform than =
ever and reaffirmed that the remote work and D&I pressures everyone is =
facing now really helped seal the deal, especially given that Bechtel is =
feeling the pressure of the pandemic financially. He suggested that =
Bechtel's head count would be down by half next year and that he expects =
overall R&D budgets to get wiped for the next 3-5 years. (!!!)

=20

My complete notes below, but big takeaways are:=20

=20

1. He was bullish on the video content and that they'd in fact already =
experimented with producing some of this,

=20

2. He'd forgotten about the ability to measure the efficacy of L&D and =
wants to loop in their L&D head to talk to us about it. He'd also like =
us to connect w/ a staff member who runs a college construction =
instruction event to see about measuring impact there also.

=20

3. D&I initiatives are extraordinarily sensitive, but also super =
important right now. This may be slightly longer term but he's going to =
talk to the person in charge of the initiative to see how/where Indigo =
could assist.

=20

Overall he was apologetic that things have taken so long, excited to =
start getting data, and pleased at the different approaches we can take. =
It sounds like a lot of his approach is top-down managerial; i.e., he =
wants to gather data and use it in performance assessments, creating =
more optimal teams, etc. But he also sees a lot of potential in other =
uses of the platform. Overall Bechtel seems like a really good partner =
for us.=20

Best,
Josh

his guy who is doing that is interested in Indigo for that purpose

1. to get better feedback
2. structure of biweekly pulse

longer term Q is how they incorporate Indigo data into performance =
reviews and advances in the org
could be used, but how to do this in a positive fashion?
they need more transparancy
why wasn't I promoted? Why did they get the job?
technical is easy to quantify, but how to quantify how well you do at =

can quantify the whole person.
haven't talked specifically about this internally yet

even team formation
can they optimise the group?
the other thing he wants to get into.
longer term opp.

LinkedIn Learning; an external opp
L&D at Bechtel looking at other outside opps
he's open to other content for now
wanted to demonstrate the feature element to folks and later build out =
library
is there a gap for something they think is important?
still some questions there.

he likes video content from leaders
he's had leaders do video messaging from leaders before; recently did =
customer engagement thing
they've done reenactments of desired behavior
could try that
he agrees its the 3-5m model that works best
he likes being able to put content out and track the impact + =
consumption
they don't have that ability now
no quantification of improvement

he'll connect us to his L&D person
another pole in the tent that could help drive it
he'll see if they're receptive

he'd also like us to connect w/ college construction instruction event

they teach a lot of content but don't get good feedback
