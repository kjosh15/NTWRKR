Its an interesting challenge given their cultural profile - very Japanese,
collectivist and with a focus on striving - which is obvs at odds with many
western influences, from parenting to social media via advertising - and
probably also at odds with the soft skills they actually need their
employees to develop to help the company to thrive.

 

The question is probably "how can I grow within the Takeda framework to be a
better person and a better part of Takeda?"

 

Its almost as if you need to try and apply Takeda's values to learning.

 

So their values are Integrity, Fairness, Honesty, and Perseverance

 

Completely agree with you that building a direction framework around the
training that links back to the values is the way to go - just think that
the subjects that Takeda would (I'm guessing) really like their employees to
learn about to help the company - collaboration, teamwork, creativity,
innovation etc etc don't fit very well directly into their value construct.

 

Its almost like you need a linking stage - maybe - we use our values of
honesty (with ourselves) to identify how we could learn and improve and we
use our value of perseverance to stick with the challenge of life long
learning - then you use IndigoMetrics as a "learning framework" beneath this
- come up with 6 soft skills that will help Takeda employees to thrive
within Takeda and measure against them. Indigo then uses peer data to help
with self reflection (honesty) and perseverance (tracking progress).
