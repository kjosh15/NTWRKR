Still working on it. I'm trying to get a reality check from my contacts
over there on if they're likely to sit on it for much longer. I wish I
could say this kind of dithering was unusual, but it's not a total surprise
coming from them.

I'll be following up with the whole team again Monday and will let you know
what I hear!

best,
Josh
