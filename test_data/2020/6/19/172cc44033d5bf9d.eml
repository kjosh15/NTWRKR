Just sent you an invite for 10am EST Monday - looking forward to it!

Glad to hear retirement is going so well; really curious to hear what
you've been up to with it! Things here are excellent; we made a covid cell
with another family early on in the pandemic, our sons' school knocked it
out of the park with remote learning, and two days ago we arrived in
Iceland (where my wife is from) and are now with extended family in the
countryside. We've been extremely blessed.

Have a great weekend and talk to you soon!
- J
