HOLY SHIT. Really excited to hear what you're up to and how things are
going. It's been a couple months and the world is still changing - if
anything, even faster. I just landed in Iceland and am holed up in a summer
house after experiencing their border testing process (for COVID).
What/where/how are you, and do you want to schedule a quick call? You
always reaffirm my faith in humanity, although I can understand it if
you're busy. Let me know!

- J
