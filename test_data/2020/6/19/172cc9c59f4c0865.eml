Josh

Thanks for the meeting invite!  Talk to you Monday 10 am.  So cool to hear h=
ow your family has adapted in creative ways through COVID.  Reminds me of a b=
ook on disruptive innovation.  Sometimes we need a disruptor to innovate new=
 ways. So glad you are able to be with family in Iceland.  I have to get the=
re with mine sometime!  I have heard wonderful things about the country, peo=
ple, nature and geography.=20

We have convened as a family unit in a couple of ways.  Found out we can rea=
lly enjoy time together through zoom calls and on line games. Duhhh. Why did=
n=E2=80=99t we do that sooner to stay connected with our adult kids in diffe=
rent places!! =20

Been working on several ministry ideas using hiking, camping, music, sailing=
 or woodworking (lathe and live edge tables). Cool to see who life brings in=
 and how these open up so many rich discussions leading to really meaningful=
 relationships. Also playing with data quality work with ECCMA in support of=
 a more profitable, free, secure and efficient supply chain. Just dabbling n=
ow but excited about some cool things developing.=20


Have felt very blessed during this year and a noticeable new degree of conne=
ction with people and God through COVID and the heartbreaking loss of life r=
esulting from racial bias  Horrible disease and behaviors yet causing us to p=
ause and think differently.=20

I see you are on vacation and fully understand if you prefer to wait until y=
ou are back. Very honored you are willing find time during your family time t=
o catch up. =20

I look forward to talking live and will plan on Monday at 10 am EST unless y=
ou=E2=80=99d like to move out.=20

God bless

Van
