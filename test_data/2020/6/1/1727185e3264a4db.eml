Hi Josh,<br>
I had a good look at New Lab. It looks really interesting and I have lots o=
f questions too.<br>
<br>
From what I understand it started as most incubators do as a real estate pl=

 This is what I think is missing and where I=E2=80=99m stuck with the fundi=
ng model...<br>

What do you think?<br>
