Just got off the phone with Carl; he's very heads-down on a project he
kicked up around aggregating data on COVID-19 and using that to structure a
data-led response on reopening where, when, and how. I'd suggest you and I
get on a call to see if Avery can make a pitch to them immediately to
contribute - could be very good PR as well as a hedge into a new set of
services; Carl is very bullish on expanding the platform to serve all
other industries.

Otherwise we spoke briefly about the other initiatives you and I discussed
and he asked me to send him some summaries in writing, which I have done.
I'll follow up on this to see if we can get more traction - right now I'm
pushing for an intro to Chris Clark to see if we can piggyback on his
project to test more solutions as part of the overall project.

So, a good first step. Carl's attention is clearly focused on this COVID-19
initiative, but seems amiable to reviewing the solutions you suggested and
hopefully will get us to the right stakeholders to drive the next
conversation.

Let me know if I can fill in any more detail, let me know what you think
about Avery and COVID, and I hope you and yours are well!

All best,
Josh
