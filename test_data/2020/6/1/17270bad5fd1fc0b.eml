Carl,

Pleasure speaking with you earlier - again, let me reiterate my interest in
your COVID-19 dashboard. That's a genius idea and an extraordinarily
necessary one now and going forward!

In terms of Avery Dennison, we felt that there are a few RFID plays for
Estee that could help get the most out of the new normal due to COVID:

1) BOPIS (Buy Online Pick up In Store) - Likely to see big growth. Knowing
how much inventory you have where and when is key. The value of a good
inventory is magnified when you broadcast to a customer that can then come
and pick it up.

2) UHF to confirm sterility - UHF is being explored as a way to confirm to
customers/consumers that a garment has been treated, sterilized or not yet
tried on; similar assurances might be helpful for cosmetics.

3) LiA (Local Inventory Ads) - we have been working with Google on the LiA
initiative. This allows for local search online via google for in stock
items within brick and mortar. This is similar to BOPIS, but more to verify
that an item is available before a customer heads into the retail space.

4) What is in your supply chain (and where) is another obvious one we
already covered, hitting both Ship From Store and Store to Store.

Avery has heard that there is an RFID project kicking off at Estee called
Secure and Connect (I believe this is being initiated by Chris Clark VP of
GLobal Supply Chain), which is still in the early exploratory stages. It
might be worth kicking up a conversation about the above to see if they can
be additive or could piggyback on the effort to create more learning.

Let me know about the above, thanks again, and best of luck in navigating
what promises to be an interesting summer!

All best,
Josh

P.S. Avery has also heard that Estee is looking at machine vision (PUF or
Physically Unclonable Function) as a tool for unique identity and track and
trace - again, to hit the authenticity issue you mentioned on the phone.
They've got some significant concerns about the tech (and would clearly
like to sell you an alternative). Let me know if a contrary opinion would
be useful in proving/disproving PUF!
