Do you know anyone who can help me think through next steps after moving my
SaaS platform to an AWS instance? I understand our long-term end goal
(lambda front end, centralized VM backend), but need help on the (as cheap
as possible) near term - making the front end instance replicable and
configurable for each new client, security lockdown steps, etc. etc. Any
suggestions?

In the meantime, I=E2=80=99ve got a few good contacts at Visa and Mastercar=
d in
case our Amex guy doesn=E2=80=99t work out - worth waiting another week as =
I
imagine he=E2=80=99s getting internal feedback now.

Much obliged,
Josh
