to see.  I=E2=80=99d love to connect.

<div class=3D"">That reality of the EU market may be a feature&nbsp;not a b=

heck them out!) with the New Labs model you might be able to get more tract=
ion. Or, better yet, create in-house service firms
 to deliver on the MVPs in conjunction with outside talent looking to be ac=
qua-hired. That way you can come in expecting a regular, full time job doin=
g science or tech with the potential&nbsp;option of being hired away on a p=
roject you're in love with.&nbsp;</div>

<div class=3D"">Takeda went well - too well. I spoke to the woman looking t=
o hire for 2.5 hours and had to end before she was ready so I could go to t=
he restroom. She apparently raved about me BUT seemed to feel I might be &q=
uot;too big&quot; for the role. She expressed interest
 in my ability to consult, so much so that I got bumped up to the #2 at Kor=
n Ferry to talk regarding, but he clearly felt that KF delivered consulting=
 on human capital management - not the broader tech remit I usually serve.&=

 to push numbers and clock hours, but really really loved my vision, which =
may mean I don't get to do either. :/</div>

Hi Josh,<br class=3D"">
I had a good look at New Lab. It looks really interesting and I have lots o=
f questions too.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
From what I understand it started as most incubators do as a real estate pl=
ay, and is well supported by local government in NYC.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Where this really coincides with what I was thinking is on the type of inno=
vation they are focusing on=E2=80=A6that is really spot on.<br class=3D"">
The biggest difference is that they rely on start-ups and entrepreneurs, wh=
ile I think many great innovators and scientists are more risk-averse (or i=
s this a European view?) and would need a home for a longer period, with mo=
re long term employment prospects.
 This is what I think is missing and where I=E2=80=99m stuck with the fundi=
ng model...<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
What do you think?<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
How did Takeda go?<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Best,<br class=3D"">
