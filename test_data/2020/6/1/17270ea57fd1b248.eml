Glad you're still kicking up a fuss out there! We've got two kids (4 and 7)
and are hoping to head to Iceland in the next couple weeks (assuming there
are flights, etc. etc.) Income =3D=3D 0 for some months now as usually this=
 is
prime speaking season, but my pivot is pointing at some really interesting
options in health tech, HR (I have a startup that's growing fast around
measuring and monitoring employee beliefs and behaviors), and general tech
innovation consulting.

As for visiting, who knows what the future will bring? Maybe the virus is
mutating into something more benign, maybe we'll see mRNA vaccines soon,
maybe maybe maybe... For now, it's still just wait and see.

The main thing, to my mind, is that we're getting to see and influence the
adoption of ten years of tech in a single year. That's fucking amazing from
any standpoint, and if it can herald big improvements in civil liberties
and other elements along the way I'm all for it. But I've always been
optimistic. ;)

All best,
Josh
