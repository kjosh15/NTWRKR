Am getting to the 7-9 calls a day mark. Not sure if that's a good thing...

One call that stuck with me was from the CTO of an insurance company who
had dug a little into PWC's human resource analytics system. He said he
thought Indigo was a great fit for what they were making. Would you want to
approach them reg., (i.e., do you have any contacts there) or are they too
targeted?
