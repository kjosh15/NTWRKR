Just spoke to Aaron, founder of these guys:

https://www.imperative.com/about

He and I spoke a month or two ago. He's seeing a lot of discussion around
D&I and is meeting it by connecting folks into increasingly challenging
conversations. He'd love to find a (cheap and fast) way to work together on
something - could we provide a model to pair people for peer-to-peer
coaching using his system? I.e., we determine who should talk with whom to
provide the biggest disparity between values and/or bias, and he provides
the platform to facilitate the conversation?
