Had a good conversation with a former C-suite exec from L'Oriel who now
does transformation workshops; he's introducing me to the firm he works
with to launch the workshops. As usual, they want a deck to facilitate the
intro.

That's where we're breaking down now - I know our deck isn't going to
express to them that we're a polished, professional platform the way a
firms used to working with luxury-goods companies will be used to.

He also made a good point about that "next step" which was that we need to
align the product with a strategic goal for them to get the most out of it
and to understand the potential.

All that said, I think you're right about case studies. They're gold!!
