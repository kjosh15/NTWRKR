I really like the master Svengali approach IF you combine it with emergent
behaviors and evolutionary values. I.e., you (the CEO) can manage, tweak,
etc. but are doing it in response to an evolving set of values (that
respond to market conditions, new corporate targets, etc. etc.)

We need a slack channel for all this thinking, BTW.
