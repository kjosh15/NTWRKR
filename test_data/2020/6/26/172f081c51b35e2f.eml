Thanks for the call today; as usual I learned a bunch. When will get get to
talk about nootropics?!?

In the meanwhile, please find a brief overview deck on our platform
attached. I'd be very curious to hear what the firm you work with on your
workshops makes of it - we're data guys, and have a fairly exclusive
property in this platform, but very much so need partners who can take it
and use it to create the transformations it so accurately maps.

Looking forward,
Josh
