Personal Feedback from your peers related to your actions in the =
Respectful area.


Suggestions from your peers as to how you could improve:


Colin is a bit of a bully. Picks on people quite a bit. Recently, he has =
been seemingly fighting with Brian. I didn't appreciate his "I will talk =
to my people" comment on teams. I consider myself one of his people and =
he DOES NOT speak for me. Seems a bit like a union boss organizing a =
team against the CEO. Wasn't a good look. Brian is a good-natured guy =
and I think they are friendly so I don't think that will hurt him in the =
long run, but if that happened at other companies I have worked at, he =
would have been fired.


Examples from your peers of how you have recently improved in this area:


Colin is a bully sometimes. He puts down a lot of people at work which =
is funny, but at the expense of the person he is belittling. Sometimes =
you can be funny without "roasting" someone.


I don't have a lot of interaction with Colin but he has always been =
respectful from my perspective.


I never had an issue with Colin. He's just a funny guy.


Colin has, since the launch of IncLign, tailored his comedic genius to =
be less at the expense of colleagues and more family-friendly (but =
hasn't lost the sense of humor that makes him a blast to have around). =
As a result, his empathy is shining through. That said, there has never =
seemed to be a lack of empathy in his communications with clients.


Since IncLign was rolled out among Rivel employees, Colin has been =
noticeably cognizant of the way his words might impact morale and has =
made strides to be kind, thoughtful and inclusive without losing his =
sense of humor.


He is more mindful of what he says in team meetings.


Colin can be very funny, but sometimes he crosses the line.
