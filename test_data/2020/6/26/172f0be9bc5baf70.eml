Hulda,

*Short version:*

I think I figured out our best choices around cell data and your folks
internet subscription. I'll top up to 25GB/month, and we'll use the local
internet for everything else - but you should call them to find out why
it's so slow!!

*The details:*

Your folks are paying 6,500kr/month for 50GB/month internet. We can pay
3,000kr/month for 25GB/month.

I used 5GB in ~2 weeks (for 2,000kr), so I'm guessing that if we went to
the 3,000kr plan it would cover all my needs, even if I used it more AND
used it as a wifi hotspot (meaning faster speeds for video conferences,
etc.)

The costs stack up, but if we're going to keep using Frelsi anyway it's
only 1,000kr more per month to us - the kids can keep using the wireless
here.

*Next steps:*

1. I'm going to top up to 25GB, after midnight if I can get away with it so
our billing cycle doesn't leave us stranded Aug 28th.

*2. Can you call your folks internet provider (I sent you an email from
your Mom with all the info) to see why it's so slow? My guess is they need
to send a new wifi router. *

xoxo,
Josh
