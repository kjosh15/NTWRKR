I think I found part of the problem with CGMs being used for weight control=

The summary short version is that everyone's body reacts differently to
different foods in different contexts at different times. Nutrino is a
great example of why this is a shit reason to stop pushing on this; they
want really accurate, personalized information to combine with their
enormous library of food data.

That's totally missing the point that 80% of the value is in the 20% of the
accuracy CGMs can provide; i.e., that if MOST OF THE TIME you can GENERALLY
tell if blood sugar is going up or down you can give real-time feedback to
change behavior.

That's my hypothesis. I'll let you know if I can verify further!
