You know them better than I - having a conversation to start sounds wise.

They're all adaptable. Moreover, they can be changed over time so you can
measure different dimensions, or to shift focus in response to what the
organization emerges as areas of interest.

First and foremost it's designed to tell individuals where they're
perceived as being stronger or weaker than their peers around core values,
and to provide immediate and actionable means for them to improve. In the
process, management gets a statistically accurate model of where/who is
leading in terms of engagement or alignment for each of those values.

This means that you can decide if you want to focus on particular skills,
areas of growth, values of increased import to the organization (such as
innovation), etc. We suggest you start with your core values to establish a
baseline, and then slowly add in new measures over time in response to what
you learn from said baseline.

Finally, as you establish a baseline and start experimenting with different
measures in response to weaknesses and strengths in your organization, it
becomes possible to identify patterns of success - such as what sorts of
strengths work best in which kinds of jobs, what skills are needed most
within different groups, and what kinds of stimulus (experiences, training,
material, etc.) lends itself best to create the right kind of growth.

Absolutely correct. We manage this by providing relative measures instead
of absolute numbers. I.e., if John is struggling with collaboration both he
and his HR manager will know that he's scoring very low on the
Collaboration value (because they both see it in the graphs), but because
the graph is relative to the group there is no number to argue over.
Instead, it's simply a reflection of the reality of the perception of
John's peers.

In this way, because we're focused on the employee first, conversations
with HR around good/bad fit challenges are a matter of both the employee
and employer dealing with what *is*, versus what is perceived. In practice
these measures are never a surprise, but by having a statistical model it
precludes the usual "he said/she said" disputes and shifts the conversation
to relative velocities of change.

In practice we've found that this leads to a lot more proactivity on the
part of employees: they know how their soft skills, behaviors, and beliefs
are being perceived, they know their managers also see the same reality,
and they know how fast (or slow) those numbers are changing and in which
direction they're trending. This means that the employees who want to
improve have reason and context to ask for help directly... and those who
don't know sooner that they need to make other plans.

Fabulous!! Thanks so much, Van - really excited to see where this might go!
On a separate topic, do you have a website or CV I could use to represent
you to my contact working on food supply chains in the midwest?

All best,
Josh
