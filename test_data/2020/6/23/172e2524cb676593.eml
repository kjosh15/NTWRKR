Hi Josh!

Apologies that I missed your previous email! For reasons I'll describe
below, I've been inundated with work from two full-time jobs, and tons of
messages have been falling through the cracks. So I'm really glad you wrote
again. I'd be delighted to catch up! How's early next week? I'm
fairly flexible on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Here's the quick update:

I guess the last time we spoke was before the pandemic got out of control.
At that time, I was planning to submit my resignation to the college and
jump back into my nonprofit full-time. But then, with the
economic situation, my wife and I realized that we were at risk of losing
both of our jobs and all our benefits. (I believe I had described to you
the stressful situation that she was already facing, even before the
pandemic, where the Trump administration had withdrawn all the funds from
her nonprofit, which were supposed to be committed through 2022. That meant
she had to raise a million dollars to cover the shortfall. Unfortunately,
that job became even harder with the economy entering a recession and most
philanthropists re-routing their funding to COVID-19 causes.) Long story
short: I'm sticking it out with the college, and devoting a lot of effort
to making a bad situation much better. But I'm also trying to rescue and
resuscitate my own nonprofit.

We can discuss this more when we talk. But I'm still enthusiastic about
exploring what we might do together, even if my radio silence might
indicate otherwise! Again, please forgive my going AWOL for the last few
months! Excited to reconnect!

Best,
Scott
