Long time no speak - the world is definitely a new and more interesting
place now!! I'm writing as I've been trying to connect with Farhana
Chaudhry about the use of wearables for health monitoring (I've been
working with some big insurers, healthcare providers, and medical device
manufacturers) and the NDA is slowing things down. I know it's not your
department, but you were able to work miracles way back when I was first
struggling with Verizon bureaucracy and I thought you might have some
advice!

I hope all is well and you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
