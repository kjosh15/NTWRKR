No news; it happened out to sea, so we felt it a little while I was on the
call with you guys, but nothing since then.

And I love your piece! This is a great example of some of my favorite stuff
from you; fun, quick, and so authentic. I really love the pieces where your
character shines through so much.

xoxo,
Josh
