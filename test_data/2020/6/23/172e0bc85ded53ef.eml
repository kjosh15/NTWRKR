So identifying the individuals is easy =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cmatching =
bronze medallists with gold medallists=E2=80=9D or similar .

=20

Think the problem is how we get the gold medallists to create the media =
=E2=80=93 ideally instead of asking a gold medallist to give text advice =
to a bronze medallist we would get them to record a little video =
=E2=80=93 or one of the personalised gifts that spark a little hit of =
adrenalin as discussed in the article.

=20

But getting people to create video seems difficult =E2=80=93 at least at =
the moment for us =E2=80=93 tik tok and snapchat seem to have cracked =
it. I think maybe the route to this leads through allowing people to =
share their scores publicly =E2=80=93 if that info is public and the =
reviewee has made themselves open to feedback by making their score =
public maybe it would be easier to post them a video?

This makes me think that our platform might benefit from identifying =
individuals within teams who can create greater uplift in values =
adherence if they were more aligned - and then using some of the tips =
from this article to create that. Let me know if that makes sense; I =
think there's a really powerful opportunity here to use our modelling to =
prompt interactions that are meaningful and can create change.

Social distancing is going to kill your employee retention unless you do =
this one thing
This past week, I was scanning through my Facebook feed when I came =
across a video of someone cutting hair with a clear plastic barrier =
between themselves and their customer.
