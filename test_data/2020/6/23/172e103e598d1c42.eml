Hello buddy,

Great to hear from you. Iceland, smart choice. Pretty much anywhere but the
US right now...

Yes deffo. Would be great to catch up. Has been too long. We, like most of
our clients, have had to do a bit of a pivot but the reality is there's
just not enough liquid cash out there just now. Most businesses are
sitting, like Scrooge McDuck, on their piles of cash waiting for the storm
to pass. Doom and gloom aside, there are some super interesting opportunity
areas and we're treating it as an opportunity to simplify our approach and
get the business super tight.

How are you fixed next week? Tuesday?

Nick
