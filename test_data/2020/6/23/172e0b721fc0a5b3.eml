Hope you're still doing well out there - we landed in Iceland this week and
it's been mind blowing. It's as though COVID didn't exist: zero distancing,
isolation, masks... or infections. So far, anyway. Two Q's:

1. What are your kids' views on working with startups? We're signing up a
couple really big clients and need to transition to cloud very fast while
also running for SOC2 compliance.

2. Any word on hiring within Google? Curious to keep the ball rolling.

All best,
Josh
