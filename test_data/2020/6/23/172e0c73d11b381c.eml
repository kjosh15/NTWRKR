Just checking in; I hope you're getting some rest and managing well given
these strange, strange times...

Let me know if you're focusing 100% on parenting or are also juggling
Ascent. If you're available, I'd love to reconnect and compare notes: I'm
really curious how Ascent is pivoting given the pandemic, and even have
some ideas.

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
