Didn't get a chance to connect over the winter break, but we've finally
made it to Iceland so are in the same time zone if not the same city (we're
in Akureyri now.)

Let me know if you're up for a brief call to compare notes on growing a
company in a pandemic - I'd love to hear your thoughts on tech employment
in Iceland and see if I can help connect you with anyone abroad!

All best,
Josh
