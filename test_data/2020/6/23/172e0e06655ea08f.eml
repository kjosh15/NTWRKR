Hey there,

I'd like to introduce the two of you.

@Ele Diakomichalis <self@eleftherios.io> is an old colleague from
SoundCloud, who has been working on some interesting stuff in the
blockchain space at his new start up. There's some info here
https://monadic.xyz/ but Ele can probably give the broader context in
person.

@Josh@josh.is <josh@josh.is> is an old, old friend of mine (we grew up on
the same street and played D&D and ran around in the woods together as
kids) who has done a lot of consulting, speaking, advising across tech and
for various industries. Josh is looking to move his family to the Berlin
(Iceland/EU passports) and hoping to start building his network here.

I think the two of you would get along well, so I thought I should make the
introduction.

cheers,
dean.
