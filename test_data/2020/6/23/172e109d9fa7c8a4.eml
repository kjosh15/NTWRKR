What about identifying when a gold medalist identifies a bronze medalist as
improving - can we use that as an opportunity to ask them to articulate a
compliment? I.e., "what did John Doe do this week that indicated strength
in value X?"

Trying to think about how to create greater velocity in alignment over
time, plus how to use qualitative data with our quantitative models as
that's a strong IP hedge.
