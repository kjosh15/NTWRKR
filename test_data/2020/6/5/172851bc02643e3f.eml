Joe,

We have a bunch of notes about portable power, but they're not put into a
publishable format yet. If you can make sense of the below can we revise
together and I'll put it on the wiki? Also doing more digging reg. water
damage, although I think you've got the best recommended solution so far.

From my co-builder Steve:

"When I wrote this I had two goals: publish the information I have about
Crowbox power consumption, and provide advice about which portable power
products will work. It's very, very, very important that people heed the
"no auto shutoff" advice. MOST power banks shut themselves off when the
current draw is low, and this does NOT work for us, because an idle Crowbox
uses very little power. There are LOTS of power banks to choose from, and
most are quite inexpensive, so people will be tempted to just pick one up
off of Amazon. If they do this, they will likely get a model that shuts
itself off, and that means their Crowbox will spontaneously go offline. We
can only certify one of the power bank models that I tested- the Voltaic.
Certainly there are other models that will work but we're not going to do
full-scale product testing like that. We'll have to leave it up to the
community. Restating: Make sure people understand the "no auto shutoff"
feature is critical, and that it's the minority, not majority, of power
bank products that will work for our application."

We're looking at working up some notes on running a Crowbox from a 12V
battery. This will require a buck converter, which costs about $10, but a
motorcyle/ATV battery would run a Crowbox for a long time. Also, where
applicable (sunny places) the Voltaic V15 power bank and Voltaic solar
panel could run a Crowbox indefinitely. Or, as stated below, the V44 power
bank should run a Crowbox for almost a full week before needing a charge.

Let me know if either/both of those seems more profitable than the below.

As we discussed, running a CrowBox from a power bank would require a power
bank without "auto off" functionality. Almost all power banks have "auto
off" functionality built-in, so it's important to shop carefully in order
to find a power bank which will work for our needs. The feature we're
looking for is sometimes called "always on" mode, sometimes called "no auto
shut off" mode and at other times called "low power charging" mode. You may
have to search using all three terms to find a suitable power bank.



I bought two such power banks to test myself:



-Voltaic Systems V15 (4,000 mAh)

-Xiaomi Mi Power Bank Pro (10,000mAh)



My testing process was simple: Hook a CrowBox up to each power bank to see
how long the bank would power the CrowBox before hitting the low-voltage
cutoff. I also used an external ammeter to double-check the actual power
delivery of each power bank against its rated capacity. The ammeter I used
features an isolated power supply so that I could be sure the ammeter
itself wasn't consuming any of the battery power.



NOTE: While the Xiaomi advertises a "low power charging" mode, which is
what we want, this power bank will only operate in 'low power' mode for two
hours, which means that the Xiaomi power bank failed my testing and is not
a good choice for powering a CrowBox. This is a shame because this is an
otherwise high-quality power bank with high capacity and low cost. Perhaps
future versions will allow this power bank to run indefinitely in low-power
mode but for now my recommendation is avoid this model for this project.



So, this leaves me only one power bank to test: The Voltaic Systems V15, so
the rest of this post will focus on this particular power bank.



First off- the V15 has an 'always on' charging mode which can be toggled on
or off by holding the power button down for six seconds. Unlike the Xiaomi
power bank, the V15 stays in 'always on' mode and will power the attached
device until the power bank's internal battery hits the low-voltage cutoff.
This is perfect for us and worked very well during my testing.



The V15 is rated at 4,000mAh capacity but I found that the pack delivered a
total of 2,559mAh before hitting the low-voltage cutoff. This wasn't a
complete surprise, since a rule of thumb for USB power banks is to expect
somewhere around 60% overall efficiency. In my test case, I observed about
64% efficiency. The energy we lost was likely consumed by the voltage
regulator and the charge control circuitry of the power bank.



An idle CrowBox consumes around 45 to 46 mA of current, so my test CrowBox
was continuously powered by the V15 for around 55.5 hours. So, using a V15
power bank, I'd suggesting running the CrowBox for no more than 48 hours
before pulling the power bank to recharge it.



Having to stop and charge the battery pack every two days doesn't sound
super awesome, but I can think of some options:



-Buy two V15 packs so that you can hot-swap for one that's fully charged.
The V15 pack that I bought cost around $30USD from amazon so the total cost
would be around $60



-Buy a larger capacity power bank from Voltaic Systems (like the V44) which
should be able to run a CrowBox for seven full days and nights.



-Buy one of Voltaic Systems' add-on solar panels to extend the runtime of
the power bank. If your CrowBox would be set up in a place that receives
some sunshine each day, it's quite possible that a V15 power bank with a
Voltaic Systems solar panel would never need to be shut down or brought
inside to recharge. You can buy a V15 power bank and 3.5 watt solar panel
direct from Voltaic Systems for $69 USD, which sounds like a pretty good
value to me.
