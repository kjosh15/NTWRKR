I think the real impact would be around sharing data together. You and I
don't seem to be motivated by this, but almost all current exercise apps
have a "stream" of posts from friends, means for sharing new scores with
friends, teaming functions to encourage each other, etc. etc. Personally I
don't find that motivating, but many do - and I think Sutter is trying to
figure out how to use that social proof function (which we've shown works
so well with Indigo) to create behavior change around exercise, diet, etc.
Do you see a specific use case there?
