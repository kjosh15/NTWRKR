This is just an update - no action is required on your part.

The EIDL loan was the one other gov't loan I thought we might be able to
apply for. I'll see about unemployment once we've spent the PPP. For now,
it looks like the EIDL grants max out at $1000 per employee, can't be used
for salary payments, and takes about two hours to file for - and there's no
guarantee it'll be granted. So I might go for it to cover phone bills, but
only if there's time.

xoxo,
Josh
