Thanks, Joe!!! You might start by scattering cheetos around and on the box
- they're almost more popular than pinkie mice, and are easier to handle.
If any one else is interested in the battery powered option let me know;
I'm digging through our notes to see if we can't publish better details.

Hope everyone is safe, healthy, and enjoying the birds!
