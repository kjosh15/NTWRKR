We got this:

https://www.themovementcreative.com/store-all?category=3DEquipment

A huge 15x15 "cube" the kids hang on alllllll dayyyyy looooong. Awesome,
but pursuant your concern it's great for chin-ups, pushups, T90x, etc. etc.

Sorry to hear it's been rough - just work, or the family slog? It's so
strange to see how these tensions are evolving. It's as though we've
suddenly taken the blindfold off about the costs to family work has been
incurring for so many years.

We're on track for Iceland, sort of. They cancelled our flight, but we
*believe* it's to reschedule us out through Boston - we just don't have any
confirmation yet as the airline fired 3/4ths of their staff some time
ago... So we'll see. If everything turns out perfectly we'll leave the 14th
and arrive just in time for them to start COVID-19 testing at the border.
Fingers crossed.

How about you? What does the summer look like for you so far, and also how
the hell is your work community surviving? These conditions seem so
contrary to the fundamental assumptions around how you build - interesting
times, but there's got to be some amazing opportunity here too!

All best,
Josh
