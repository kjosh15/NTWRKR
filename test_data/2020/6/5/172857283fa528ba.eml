Got it, thanks. Looks good.

Agreed on not undercooking Bechtel, but would suggest that the next step to
make that happen is a big investment in either tech talent and/or SOC 2
compliance.

Good news reg. Steve's thinking on funding. Agree I'd rather avoid it, but
would also like to be able to afford to do the work. Thanks for keeping
this in our back pocket.
