Just had a friend who runs accounting for a bunch of family offices plead
with me to get positioned to do due diligence and advising on M&A's before
the rush this fall. Do you think she's smoking crack on that estimation,
and/or do you think it could be a useful way to expand?

Hope you and yours are well,
Josh
