Sorry not to jump on this - with the pandemic my startup has been getting a
lot of traffic; we're onboarding our biggest client to date (55k users) and
negotiating with one of the big 4 ... exciting times! Let me know if you
want to schedule a call to catch up and share respective rage; there's
plenty to go around!

All best,
Josh
