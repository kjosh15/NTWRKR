So it=E2=80=99s a =E2=80=93 very fancy and developed =E2=80=93 =
perception survey?

Would be great to chat but I think I come back to this difference =
between parent child and adult to adult. By polling perceptions of =
ethics in this way, ethics is always someone else=E2=80=99s job to do =
something about =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cthey should do something about =
it=E2=80=9D, and this perception analysis helps inform what =
=E2=80=9Cthey=E2=80=9D should do about it.

Whereas we start with =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cwhat are you doing to =
contribute to your company=E2=80=99s ethical culture =E2=80=93 in the =
knowledge that everyone else is being held to the same =
standards=E2=80=9D.

Guess if you could merge the 2 elegantly it would be very powerful.

I am back on my hobby horse =E2=80=93 one of the reasons that sharing =
scores is important =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cwhy should I practice good ethics =
if I cant see that others are also being held accountable=E2=80=9D

And when you lose the trust in the leaders, being asked your perception =
of the status quo reinforces feelings of impotence and rage.

Imagine what the world would look like now if everyone in America (or =
here) had a personal Integrity score that included a score for =
=E2=80=9CRespect for others no matter who they are=E2=80=9D or something =
like that =E2=80=93 and if you wanted to share your score you could do =
so =E2=80=93 we would have respect scores all over social =
media=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6..

Spoke to their EVP today, did a walkthrough of our platform and got one =
of theirs. They've got a very robust surveying solution that, honestly, =
I thought would work well for stuff like SOC2 compliance - lots and lots =
and lots of questions broken down in infinitesimal detail with backup =
documentation and responsibility trails, etc.

=20

That said, they purport to measure ethics (hence the name) and seem to =
be interested in how they could use our data processing to enhance =
theirs. They were clear they wouldn't be able to take anything like this =
on until the fall due to other projects currently in their pipeline, but =
were def. interested.

=20

They're going to discuss internally and then set another meeting with =
another of their team - I'd like to bring you in on the next one.

Onwards!
