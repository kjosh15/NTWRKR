Hi -
I think in principle the JV outlines things pretty well. A missing element
is the revenue share for any IM contracts signed through our relationships
and/or efforts that I mentioned in my email of xxx that replaced all the
complexity of equity and long-term what-if scenarios. Also, we'll need to
add more definition to the scope of our services to you - as written it
could vary wildly.

I've been doing my best to understand any precedent for these types of
revenue shares, but they vary tremendously and all options have pros and
cons. It's fundamentally a question of being worth everyone's while to do
it and what we're all comfortable with and what we might not be. To get
there I propose that we get 20% of the first year of any contract that
comes through Big Spaceship and 10% of the second year. If the customer
increases their contract above a certain threshold, it kicks in again and
we get 20% of year 1 of the expanded contract and 10% of year 2. This is to
account for the cases where we might start with a group within a larger org
and then it expands to another group or company wide. From what I've been
reading on the economics of SaaS, it seems like that is neither greedy nor
onerous.

Bechtel is super interesting - I think I mentioned the work we did with one
of their competitors, so we understand their industry. I have an
interesting lead as well.

Let me know what you think and if you want to talk it through.

M

 themselves embed the target values / behaviors / tone of voice. So essenti=
ally, a question that is worded correctly according to the definition of va=

the process of reviewing against the questions can change a way that an org=

the uniqueness of the host culture is the primary reference point that we a=
