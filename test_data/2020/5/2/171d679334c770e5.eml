Hi neighbors,

Hope you are all doing well. Some updates:

*Join our meeting on Tuesday May 5, 7PM-8PM *(Every two weeks, for now)

   - We'll be encouraging everyone to introduce themselves and discussing
   upcoming actions. A meeting summary will be included in the Friday email.
- *Join by Video Call:* To join the video call, click this link: https://
   meet.google.com/zjf-ihai-msy <https://meet.google.com/zjf-ihai-msy> . If
   using laptop or desktop, you won't need the Meet app and won't need to sign
   into Google. If asked, use meeting code: zjf-ihai-msy . To UNMUTE
   yourself to speak, click the audio button (microphone symbol).
   - *Join by Dial-In*: Dial +1 347-480-3601 and enter this PIN: 645 195
   700# (end with pound symbol "#"). To UNMUTE yourself to speak: dial *6
   (star-6).

*Following Up on Action 1: Report "We Have No Super!" to 311*

   - Please tell us if you reported to 311
   <https://forms.gle/kWnCGD3WCiA6q2K29>, or if you tried to, so that we
   have a count. And thank you!
   - If you didn't report, you can still do it this weekend. Here's how.
   <http://bit.ly/wheresmysuper>
   - Some people told us that they could not report anonymously. Don't do
   anything you are uncomfortable with. PS -- If your 311 operator is only
   asking for a phone number, you can create a free new phone number
through Google
   Voice <http://voice.google.com>. Here's how.
   <https://www.dailydot.com/debug/google-voice-number/>
   - Good news: A code compliance inspector was spotted in the courtyard
   this week shortly after our 311 action.

*Coming Soon... Action 2: Reporting Repair Complaints to Management*

   - All tenants should: 1) fill out a tenant repair complaint checklist
   and 2) review our letter to management. By *Saturday, May 9*, we will
   email the documents and give printed copies to anyone who needs one. Please
   complete by *Monday, May 11*. More details to come.

*In other news:*

   - *We're in contact with almost 80% of our tenants. *Help us reach the
   last 10 apartments
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MV_IHl6C0BbBv0W-ZGapodtX0nl6rnEFcXISVd5n0-A/edit?usp=sharing>.
   If you know for a fact that they are vacant, please tell us.
   - *The road ahead:* We now have a public timeline
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Aiv-Wz2QUm2mQv3C4Qc5ASnDv1GX2lO40TOmlxr2K9I/edit?usp=sharing>
of
   our tenant association's current and future projects. We need your help to
   make it all happen.
   - *Tenants all over NYC are on rent strike to #CancelRent. *As
   unemployment reaches new highs due to COVID-19, nearly one third
   of Americans did not pay rent in April. Thousands of tenants across
NYC are not
   paying rent
   <https://gothamist.com/news/thousands-nyc-tenants-kick-historic-rent-strike-distressing-landlords>,
out
   of necessity or in solidarity with others, to create pressure on landlords
   and government to provide rent relief.
   Due to COVID, *some of our tenants were not able to pay rent in April*,
   and many others need rent relief soon. Management has been unresponsive to
   tenants' requests for rent payment plans and rent reductions. We plan to
   survey all tenants on their willingness to participate in a rent strike and
   other strategies to request rent relief (such as a letter).
   - *All voters can now ask to vote by mail*: Request an absentee ballot
   <https://nycabsentee.com/absentee> to vote in the June 23 elections.
   Even if you aren't sick, it is now legal <https://nycabsentee.com/> to
   select "Temporary illness" as your reason for requesting an absentee
   ballot, to avoid catching COVID-19.

Cheers,
Your neighbors
Hayes Court United
