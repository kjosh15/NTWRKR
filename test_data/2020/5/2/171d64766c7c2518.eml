Looks like we found someone to take the place the whole time. That said, we
live in unprecedented times, so things may change!! If so, we'll def. hit
you up to see if you might want to jump in. Thanks again for the clear
communication!

Also, am I right that you're looking for internships? Got any tech skills?
What are you looking for?
