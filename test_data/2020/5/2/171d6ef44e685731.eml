Hi Josh,

Thanks for your questions.

1.
https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Repair-Compl=
aint-Form.pdf
We are going to use that one. No electronic version yet. Maybe google form?

2. You can repeat your 311 report if you want but we mainly wanted to
create the record of it being done, so we aren=E2=80=99t asking anyone to r=
epeat
the call.

Jay
