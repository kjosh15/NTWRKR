POC Software Agreement:

*	I'll call the lawyer tomorrow to resolve the issue below rather than
email, seems to be what he wants!
*	I think the NDA in the POC is 1 way (in their favour) and think we
need something 2 way to cover us if we release all of the policy / security
/ CAIQ docs to them. He has suggested switching in the confidential info
para from the SaaS agreement which would be fine
*	There is no term or termination clause in the doc - which is strange
- so I'll ask their lawyer how we are supposed to cancel (we are granting
them a license so I want to know how to revoke it)
*	The doc includes a requirement for us to install within 4 months (i)
application vulnerability scanning as a part of software release cycle and
(ii) pen tests (although looks like we could pen test internally).
Guess we just sign up to this?
*	Propose that we suggest a free stage 1 (20 people) hosted on the UK
database and then a switch to charging and an AWS installation for the next
stage - OK with you?
At some point I was after clarification as to when we switch from POC to
SaaS, but think that is a discussion between the Bechtel guys first so maybe
we leave Misha to manage that

 

I also read the SaaS agreement in its entirety to see what is coming:

*	Insurance: looks like we can hit their insurance requirements with a
UK company and UK insurance policy so no need for a sub
*	I don't like quite a bit of the wording so at some point we would
need to decide whether to roll over and sign for speed or get a lawyer
involved and slow it down. Wording not intentionally bad - its more that
it's a generic doc and therefore is heavily open to interpretation regarding
issues important and specific to us. Speed probably best at present!
*	SAML 2.0 single sign on is included
*	Encryption at rest included
*	States that we should have SOC 2 or ISO 27001
