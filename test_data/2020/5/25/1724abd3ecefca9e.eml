Agree we need a roadmap, but are you talking:
- what we plan to do in the next 12 months (post the Bechtel call I =
added this to my list of jobs for this week)
- an explanation of how we scale the technology to hit millions? If we =
need to do we could actually do this with the AWS windows VM approach - =
but there are obvs smarter approaches=20
- an explanation of how we expect to modify the functionality - off the =
top of my head (i) we need to develop and maybe fork look and feel, (ii) =
add in proximity driven reviewing, (iii) invest in the Instagram type =
empathetic upskilling channel, (iv) build an app with notification =
capability

Agreed on the sweet spot - I always come back to the feedback that my =
friend at Workday gave - all we are missing is a few (maybe as few as 2 =
or 3) high profile customers that are willing to stand up and say they =
love the platform - and we could (if we want to) look for a pretty =
decent acu-hire?

Will try for a gartner customer.

Think we need to build a longer/larger development roadmap to serve =
large customers so we=E2=80=99re better positioned for an M&A =
conversation.

Also, do you have any leads on getting the Gartner report mentioned =
here? Would be extremely useful.

Finally, I think we=E2=80=99re really headed towards a sweet spot for =
IndigoMetrics in terms of acquisition - if we can demonstrate scale and =
keep our retention numbers high we could fit a very nice niche for big =
players looking to expand capability in this space.
