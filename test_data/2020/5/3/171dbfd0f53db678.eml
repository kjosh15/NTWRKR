Please read this article by Yale Epidemiologist, Jonahan Smith. It is both s=
tartling and sobering.
Long read but worth it.
" As an infectious disease epidemiologist, at this point I feel morally obli=
gated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission d=
ynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures. Lik=
e any good scientist I have noticed two things that are either not being art=
iculated or not present in the
=E2=80=9Cliterature=E2=80=9D of social media. I have also relied on my much s=
marter infectious disease epidemiologist friends for peer review of this pos=
t; any edits are from that peer review.
Specifically, I want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and un=
ambiguous.
First, we are in the beginning of this epidemic=E2=80=99s trajectory. That m=
eans even with these distancing measures we will see cases and deaths contin=
ue to rise globally, nationally, and in our own communities in the coming we=
eks. This may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures a=
re not working. They are. They may feel futile. They aren=E2=80=99t. You wil=
l feel discouraged. You should. This is normal in chaos. But this is normal e=
pidemic trajectory. Stay calm. This enemy that we are facing is very good at=
 what it does; we are not failing. We need everyone to hold the line as the e=
pidemic inevitably gets worse.
This is not my opinion; this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which I=
 and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuan=
ce, and this disease is no exception. I want to help the community brace for=
 this impact. Stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certaint=
y that what you are doing is saving lives, even as people begin getting sick=
 and dying. You may feel like giving in. Don=E2=80=99t.
Second, although social distancing measures have been (at least temporarily)=
 well-received, there is an obvious-but-overlooked phenomenon when consideri=
ng groups (i.e. families) in transmission
dynamics. While social distancing decreases contact with members of society,=
 it typically increases your contacts with family members /
very close friends. This small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound im=
plications on disease transmission dynamics. Study after study demonstrates t=
hat even if there is only a little bit of
connection between groups (i.e. social dinners, playdates/playgrounds, etc.)=
, the epidemic isn=E2=80=99t much different than if there was no measure in p=
lace. The same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply, and th=
e result is that the community is left with all of the social and economic d=
isruption but very little public health benefit.
You should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual un=
it; if one person puts themselves at risk, everyone in the unit is at risk. S=
eemingly small social chains get large and
complex with alarming geometric speed. If your son visits his girlfriend, an=
d you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor, your neighbor is now conn=
ected to the infected office worker that your
son=E2=80=99s girlfriend=E2=80=99s mother shook hands with. This sounds sill=
y, it=E2=80=99s not. This is not a joke or a hypothetical. We as epidemiolog=
ists see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens. Co=
nversely, any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that who=
le chain.
In contrast to hand-washing and other personal measures, social distancing m=
easures are not about individuals, they are about societies working in uniso=
n. These measures also take a long time to
see the results. It is hard (even for me) to conceptualize how on a populati=
on level, =E2=80=98one quick little get together=E2=80=99 can undermine the e=
ntire framework of a public health intervention, but it does. I promise you i=
t does. I promise. I promise. I promise.
You can=E2=80=99t cheat it. People are already itching to cheat on the socia=
l distancing precautions just a =E2=80=9Clittle=E2=80=9D- a playdate, a hair=
cut, or picking up a needless item at the store, etc. =46rom a transmission d=
ynamics standpoint, this very quickly recreates a highly connected social ne=
twork that undermines all of the work the community has done so far.
Until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overco=
me in one grand, sweeping gesture, rather only by the collection
of individual choices our community makes in the coming months. This virus i=
s unforgiving to choices outside the rules.
My goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting =E2=80=98suck=
er-punched=E2=80=99 by what the epidemiological community knows will happen i=
n the coming weeks. It will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are=
 doing isn=E2=80=99t working and become paralyzed by fear, or to just=E2=80=98=
cheat=E2=80=99 a little bit in the coming weeks. By knowing what to expect, a=
nd knowing the importance of maintaining these measures , my hope is to enco=
urage continued community spirit, strategizing, and action to persevere in t=
his time of uncertainty."
