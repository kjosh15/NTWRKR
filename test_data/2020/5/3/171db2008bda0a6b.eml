Wanted to make a checklist we could refer to at each step of our travel to
make sure we had everything handy and covered. What am I forgetting from
this first draft of a list?

2        Car service 4 hours before flight
2        pack food for whole trip
2        ensure storage on top of car is available + rope
2        medical insurance cards
2        passports / docs
2        card on each of us with Kotagerdi address and contact info
2        all family has all travel info
2        confirm phones can be activated on arrival
2        confirm food can be delivered to Fjnoskadalur
2        confirm books/toys/supplies are in Fjnoskadalur beforehand

xoxo,
Josh
