Thought I'd send this via email instead of txt or slack as it's a bigger
project.

None of us know what's coming this fall, but chances are good we'll see a
resurgence of the virus. If so, school and work are likely to go virtual
again.

It occurred to me that if we booked an AirBnB (or other rental) for a big
chunk of time we can always backpedal to a smaller amount of time (or
cancel entirely!) AirBnB is very customer oriented right now, so having the
option could be a big help.

Are you guys interested in helping look for a location and placing a
reservation? If so, if you can each give me a quick brian dump on what
criteria would matter to you I'll try to formalize it so we can expedite a
search and get a reservation in place in the next few weeks.

Let me know what you think!

All best,
Josh
