Totally get it - just wanted to make sure in case you were harboring
wild dreams of fleeing to the heart of the pandemic on this
continent... ;)

Best of luck in recovery, and do stay in touch. We never know what the
future may hold!

All best wishes and good luck with that living room wall,
Josh
