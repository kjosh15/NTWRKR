Wow, I so feel this-- we are also very close to the hospital where things
all hit in Italy, at the border, and it's sucked. Professionally it was
total shut down within a few days of things.

eh maybe-- i prefer mostly remote, would be cool to do CD work, research,
small to medium companies -- my strong points are comm strategy,
funding/deck etc but it just so happened this position was a
design/creative project manager role which usually I always get overlooked
for since I dont have a portfolio of UX/UI stuff.. the director just got me
and went with it.

yes-- yeah I totally agree with you, obv having done this for the last 8
years, I couldnt agree more-- but also I found a lot of companies are
behind on this concept and idea

how are you doing otherwise? the last few years for me have been.. well.. a
ride :)
