Hey Josh!

Hope you guys are healthy and safe!

I'm sorry to say but I have to cancel for this year - All of my work came
to a full stop a week(ish) after I last messaged you (when Canada basically
shut down)... even if the border opens by then, I just wouldn't be able to
afford it, considering the loss I'm taking and I probably won't even be
back full time until June.... really sorry my man!

Vicki and I are doing ok but definitely think we're going to need to build
a wall in the living room soon (so she can watch RuPaul on one side and I
can watch Game of thrones on repeat on the other lol)

-Dave

The cats are just adorable=E2=80=A6 They played for a little bit but are no=

Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and ful=

Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done =

Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
