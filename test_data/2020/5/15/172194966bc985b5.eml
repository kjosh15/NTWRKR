To all,

Thank you for sending in your birthday videos and warm wishes. It's pretty
incredible that someone can be so genuinely loved by so many great people,
and I feel blessed to be part of Josh's life.

Josh watched the video last night and I'm kicking myself for not recording
his reaction to send to all of you. There were many great laughs, but more
heartfelt cries as he watched each of your personalized greetings. It was
so moving to see him so tearfully happy; thank you all for helping me put
this together--this was definitely a very memorable gift I know he'll
always cherish.

And as promised, here is your 12 pack of cyber beer:

 I hope you all are well and making the best of these circumstances. I'm
really looking forward to being together again when we can.

All my love,

Chelsea
