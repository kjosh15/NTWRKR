Good catching up today!! Please do let me know if you think you've got
an area of interest to pursue - it's loads of fun kicking ideas
around. Also, if you could intro me to Andrew Wilkenson of tiny
capital that'd be a big help also. I'll see if I can get Amex'
interest in the meantime.

All best,
Josh
