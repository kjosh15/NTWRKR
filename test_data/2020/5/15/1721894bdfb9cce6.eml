In case you missed it, there is some press criticizing the Abbot tests:

https://apple.news/AnjriksZGS-eWP8U1UBGUKw

From my research this appears to primarily be an issue in how the test
is conducted when at scale - i.e., we can address it in the deployment
design (outside of the work Abbot is currently doing, I am sure.)
Wanted you to be aware in case you speak to someone who brings it up.
