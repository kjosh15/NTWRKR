We're going to go with next week, so we can get the ball rolling.

Shall we say 11:00am on Wednesday?

*The Technology Leapfrog, an Innovating 50 & Digital 50 Huddle Call*
The Coronavirus pandemic has radically shifted how work gets done as
companies have been forced to compress years of technology adoption into
months=E2=80=94if not weeks or days. As organizations reevaluate everything=
 from
privacy and security to where, how and when employees work, what other
seeming non-negotiables will finally get left behind? Members from
Innovating 50 and Digital 50 huddle with long-time advisor Josh Klein to
discuss how to make the most of this opportunity to scale technology, drive
transformation and ensure business success both in the short- and long-term=
.



- What comes next?: Telework isn't going away. Ordering groceries is
suddenly the norm. Employees are now minding themselves. What other sacred
cows are we going to leave behind?

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - Privacy; who&#39;s responsible and what is needed?<br>
