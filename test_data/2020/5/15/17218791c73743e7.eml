She rents it to students during winter but uses it herself and had had it
on air for summer. She was suggesting 12.000 per night. You contact her
directly if this is of interest asgud63@ gmail.com - Her name is Asdis

 Hi Josh and Hulda,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hope you are all well and =
safe. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to pick your brains. We have bee=
n looking at different ways of moving forward with Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6fra=
r this summer. I think we will have plenty of Icelandic children and less c=
hildren from abroad. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<b=
r>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a little brainstormin=
g session with Alfrun my daughter about how we can make sure Alexia gets be=
tter stimulated the idea came that we should do regular zoom sessions with =
her. Following that I thought of an online language school. We would start =
by developing this for Icelandic children living abroad and if that works w=
ell we could possibly develop a tool for different nationalities. <br>&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before I run I wanted to ask you for an input and whet=
her you could see this as a beginning of a startup idea?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt; I would love to hear your thoughts. The initial steps will be to=
 do a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon school through Skype. It would=
 be done live so the children can interact with the app. 10 at the time and=
 they will have a teacher or two that speaks to them and guides them in the=
 theme or method we use. We would centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur =
and with the teachers we have there to start with and as part of Tungum=C3=
=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But if the idea has a bigger potential I wo=
uld be interested in setting up a company with a couple of other people tha=
t would have complimentary skills to build this on a bigger scale. <br>&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing from you whether this is so=
mething that makes sense or whether I am away with the fairies ;) <br>&gt;&=
