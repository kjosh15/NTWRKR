Good points, all. I think the dispute about UBI isn't about whether
people are happier receiving money - as you noted, that's hardly a
surprise. The part that I found interesting is that a guaranteed wage
does not (at least in this small sample in this part of the world)
seem to occupy the unemployed in trying to further milk the system
rather than actually work.

Given that we're going to either see some version of UBI, increased
widespread infection, or food riots (!!!) I'll be curious to see how
the argument shapes up!

Love,
Josh

Was this also the case in the generally unemployed group? Intuitively, one =
would think that families with children would be more inclined to find empl=
oyment. - Allow me to offer that while the aforementioned may be true in Eu=
rope, it is my thought that there is a large portion of the chronically une=
mployed in the US that feel they are entitled to governmental support and t=
end to "work the system" rather than work at a job. A guaranteed wage would=
 occupy these people full-time trying to further milk the system rather tha=
n actually work.

ill likely give away another 3 trillion. Where do you propose we get trilli=
ons upon trillions more to give to everyone?
