Thanks for sending.  Interesting stuff!  I love that there are folks out
there doing this reimagining of school (and putting a positive spin on
it).  I had a District 2 literacy meeting about some long term planning and
it leads me to believe we will indeed be looking at a new model...
Thanks for your positivity and flexibility; Othinn seems so comfortable
trying this new way of doing school (though I know it has its challenging
moments as well).
Take care,
Eleanor
