Really curious what you make of this:

https://medium.com/interfaith-now/why-your-christian-friends-and-family-members-are-so-easily-fooled-by-conspiracy-theories-5c36a835ef07

I've long wondered about the increasing prevalence of conspiracy
theories, and thought I'd seen a connection to christianity as it is
practiced in many places in the US. But I don't have a good
understanding of christianity, period, let along the diversity of its
adherents.

You seem to have really done your homework in this area; do you think
this article is useful in helping someone like myself understand the
situation?

Lots of love,
Josh
