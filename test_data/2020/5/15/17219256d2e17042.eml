Hi Chris,

Thanks for sending this over! I was able to log in with the credentials and
complete outstanding reviews. Out of curiosity, is there a reason why
you're using a 4-point scale instead of 5 in the reviews? Is a 5-point
scale too formal?

Answers to your questions in *blue* below. Looking forward seeing how this
all comes together!


   - In the current setup we refer to the score as a =E2=80=9CWorkplace Val=
ues
   Score=E2=80=9D, but this is configurable so if you would like to use dif=
ferent
   terminology please let us know. The other popular phrase is =E2=80=9CWor=
kplace Soft
   Skills Score=E2=80=9D as soft skills suggest a variable that can be trai=
ned and
   improved =E2=80=93 but then others dislike the =E2=80=9Csoft skills=E2=
=80=9D phrase!  *Can we do
   "Big Spaceship Values Score"?*
   - I have attached a word document with the email forms that we have
   uploaded to the scheme. This is where participants initially interact wi=
th
   the cultural definitions and where there can be a trade off between brev=
ity
   and completeness =E2=80=93 if you have any edits to these please let me =
know *I
   think we'll want to spend some time on this to make it feel like it's
   coming from us. Can we get this back to you early next week? *
   - I have also attached a suggest introduction text / email attachment,
   you are of course free to message the introduction of the platform howev=
er
   you would like but we provide this text in case you would like to attach=
 it
   to any announcement email *Same as above*
   - Whilst we were doing the setup we added some comments/questions to the
   action statements in the google doc =E2=80=93 if you would like to chang=
e any of
   the statements please let us know (we can also change them easily post
   introduction) The comments are slight =E2=80=93 mostly just highlighting=
 changes in
   emphasis that you may well have included on purpose *Just addressed
   those comments in the doc*



As a next step can we check that our email server will talk to yours =E2=80=
=93 can
I put your email address in one of the demo participant details and send
out a review request to check it gets through? Then if you could also
whitelist the email we use that would be great (contact@indigometrics.com)
. *Yes, go ahead!*



After that, all that is left is to upload the participants, for that we
need for each participant (in any format you like):* Kristin (cced on this
email) who is the head of talent and culture will help me with this. We'll
get something over to you by early next week. A challenge is that our org
is not dictated by discipline per se, but rather by project. It's common
that we're working more closely with people on our specific projects than
people we even manage sometimes. Would it be possible to send you a
breakdown of each project's specific org structure? I'm thinking we can
have the project names be headers, with individual employees in the rows.
Something else to keep in mind is that most people work across projects, so
the projects aren't always mutually exclusive if that makes sense. Is there
a way to adjust the algorithm accordingly? *


- Firstname, secondname, email, gender, role/position .

Can you also note who is in a manager position and should be able to see
others=E2=80=99 scores =E2=80=93 we have 2 types of manager =E2=80=93 manag=
ers that can see every
score across the entire scheme and managers that can just see scores for
participants below them in the organisation structure

Could you also let us have some sort of organisation chart / team list =E2=
=80=93
this is used as a starting point for the algorithm that decides who should
review who and also as a basis for the organisation level reporting.
