Thanks Michael, this is super helpful. Seems reasonable.

I know you're swimming in it right now, but could you give us an idea of
the exact exclusive consultancy wording you'd like to see? Similarly, a
little clarity on what would be involved in the MVP would be helpful.

I think if we can get these nailed down we can probably hit the ground
running quickly.

Stoked,
Josh
