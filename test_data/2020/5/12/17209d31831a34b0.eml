We've got a ton of give-away clothes, books, toys, etc. here and were
wondering if you were interested. Happy to lay them out on the floor if you
want to take a preview, or we can pack them up for you to go through when
you take over. So glad someone will be staying at ours with the cats while
we're away!!

Hope you guys are doing well,
Josh
