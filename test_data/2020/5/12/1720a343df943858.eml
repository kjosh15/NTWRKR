Mike,

Great talking to you today, as ever! Several items for followup:


1. Who / where would benefit from 10k thermal cameras + software to do
fever detection at office and warehouse entrances?


2. Attached is an overview deck on my own startup, offering
significant advantage to newly remote workers by helping them see
exactly what behaviors need improvement and giving leadership a
statistical model for managing them. Would love for W50 to give this a
try internally; I'm happy to set you up for free for the first three
months if you're keen. Let me know if Kim would like to connect
regarding this!


3. I mentioned I had a few other topics we could talk about in huddle
sessions in addition to the ones you suggested:

- Privacy; who's responsible and what is needed?

- The future of "purpose" in business.

- Step-functions as SOP. What "innovation" practices can we make "normal"?

- Rearticulating the supply chain: how can we use network theory to
optimize for robustness AND flexibility?

- What is the future of JV/CVC/M&A in the near and long term given
COVID-19? (This might be a great way to test the waters for a service
- see item #4, below.)


4. If you're looking at investing or matching companies with
investment options I would LOVE to assist. Now is far and beyond the
best time possible to provide this to large corporations in a
high-touch, easy-to-use way as it's clearly a buyer's market... and
there are LOADS of options. Let me know what appetite is like at W50!


5. A huddle session about a step function shift in how we manage
employees would be super fun! I am free most of next Wednesday,
although the week after would actually be better for me if that's as
good. We can focus on what radical new things we should do now, and
start with an overview of my startup and the why behind it to set
context.


As ever, thanks for kicking ass and taking names - especially in this
time of widespread uncertainty!

All best,
Josh
