Glad to hear you're doing well, and congrats on the new job!! Life here in
NYC is weird as fuck; I'm five blocks from the epicenter of the epicenter,
which has been quite an adventure. On the plus side, it's caused a massive
reorientation around system inequalities and system problems nationwide
(and globally!) Closer to home, the kids are thriving, their school is
doing incredibly well in supporting us, and we're all managed to stay
healthy. So far so good...

I sent an email to Christal but haven't heard back - Good to know everyone
is doing ok!!

xoxo,
Josh
