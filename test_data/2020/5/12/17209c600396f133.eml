That was the best minute and twenty seconds of my whole day - thank
you for that!!! Glad you're safe and healthy and with family. Let me
know if you kick off any crazy ventures I can help on, and /or if you
have an interest in comparing notes on projects; I'm getting into some
interesting stuff around health visa to enable travel, airport
testing, and the like.

And, of course, the crowbox lives on. Post COVID, most likely, but
we'll see what this summer brings...

All best wishes,
Josh
