          As some of you may remember, this Thursday, May 14th is Josh's 45=
th birthday. As we are all still experiencing the shelter-in-place, I have =
only very few options--and relatively no in-person opportunities--to celebr=
ate his special day. As such, I thought it would be fun if each of you coul=
d record a short video of yourself wishing Josh a happy birthday that I cou=
ld splice together in order to give him the essence of a "party" and accola=
de he deserves. He speaks so highly of you all (maybe with the exception of=
 a few weeks ago when you all zoomed together and he woke up in pretty bad =
form thanks to all of the "online" drinking....) and I know it would mean s=
o much to him to see all your faces and be given warm wishes on behalf of h=
is brother family.&nbsp;

ddress, or text it to me (916-284-0882; although email is preferred for bet=
ter visual)=20
          <b>on or before May 13th</b>, that will give me enough time to pu=
t something together. I realize this may not allot for enough time; I had t=
o go through great lengths to find your emails without Josh's knowing so it=
's taken some time. I apologize for making such demands so late in the game=

          I could also only get a hold of the emails here. If you recognize=
 an incorrect email (people still use hotmail? =F0=9F=98=84), and/or know w=
