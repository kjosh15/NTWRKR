Bala,

I've been in conversation with Jeff Halpern, Senior Director of
Marketing at Abbott. I suggested that Iceland could be an ideal case
study for the use of their 5-minute COVID-19 tests in airports (and
potentially in conjunction with nationwide track-and-trace to combat
the virus.)

He was very interested, but is juggling some not insignificant
internal business demands as they attempt to scale up their testing in
the US. My impression is that if we can pull together a proposal for
Abbott to deploy in conjunction with the Icelandic international
airport it would be an easy sign off for Abbott.

Primary elements of interest include Iceland's current low incidence
of the disease, likely appeal as a tourist destination in light
thereof, and the quality and rigor of the potential deployment. The
fact that it's also relatively small (and therefore easier to control)
is also a plus. If the airport can demonstrate that it has the
capacity to quickly and accurately deploy COVID-19 testing at scale
into and out of the country it could produce a groundbreaking case
study for the use of these tests globally.

Let me know if there's interest in discussing this opportunity further!

- J
