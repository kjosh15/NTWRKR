9 in the United States, and it&#39;s been a big couple weeks of working to =
help organize friends and neighbors in the calm before the storm. <br><br>T=
hat said, it&#39;s also an incredibly exciting time for big companies!! Her=
e&#39;s what I&#39;d like to talk about:<br><br>- The Overton Window (for t=
ech): We&#39;re currently compressing ten years of technology adoption into=
 six months. Our opportunity to leapfrog ahead has never, ever, ever been b=
etter. <br><br>- Privacy: the knee-jerk reaction of many companies is to bu=
y lots of spyware to attempt to keep control. But you don&#39;t have contro=
l, and this will get you less.<br><br>- Security: Workers are more autonomo=
us than ever, and BYOD is suddenly the norm. There&#39;s HUGE security risk=
 here, as ever but the biggest have nothing to do with the tech.<br><br>- A=
ll the lego pieces: Robots, IoT, AI, analytics, smartphones... We have unpr=
ecedented technology here now, already - how do we disentangle outmoded con=
text from immediate opportunity?<br><br>- What comes next?: Telework isn&#3=
9;t going away. Ordering groceries is suddenly the norm. Employees are now =
minding themselves. What other sacred cows are we going to leave behind?<br=
><br>This is just a rough list - the big picture is that we have the opport=
unity to leverage twenty plus years of the most rapid advancements in techn=
ology in human history... or repeat the same mistakes all over again. Let&#=
39;s discuss how to thread that needle!!<br><br>All best,<br><div>Josh</div=
