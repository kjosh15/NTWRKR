Yes, let's see if we can get a quick chat to discuss. To give you an idea
of what I'm thinking in general, is to create a series of regular "huddle"
calls for Innovating 50 and Digital 50 over the next few months. You'd
obviously be included on all of these but I'd have you anchor a few of them
too.

The State of Oil, Gas & Energy
The Changing Landscape of Healthcare
Technology to Maximize a Remote Workforce with Josh Klein (help me with the
name)
The Post-Pandemic Workplace with XXX
The Future of Retail, an Innovating 50 & Digital 50 Huddle Call

What other industry-specific (or otherwise) topics do you think we could
dive into? My initial thought was just to create industry segment huddles
but I think topical/industry twist is better.

-Mike

rtphones... We have unprecedented technology here now, already - how do we =
disentangle outmoded context from immediate opportunity?<br><br>- What come=
s next?: Telework isn&#39;t going away. Ordering groceries is suddenly the =
norm. Employees are now minding themselves. What other sacred cows are we g=
oing to leave behind?<br><br>This is just a rough list - the big picture is=
 that we have the opportunity to leverage twenty plus years of the most rap=
