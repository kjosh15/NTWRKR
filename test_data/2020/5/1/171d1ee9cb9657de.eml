tunity to leapfrog ahead has never, ever, ever been better. <br><br>- Priva=
cy: the knee-jerk reaction of many companies is to buy lots of spyware to a=
ttempt to keep control. But you don&#39;t have control, and this will get y=
ou less.<br><br>- Security: Workers are more autonomous than ever, and BYOD=
 is suddenly the norm. There&#39;s HUGE security risk here, as ever but the=
 biggest have nothing to do with the tech.<br><br>- All the lego pieces: Ro=
bots, IoT, AI, analytics, smartphones... We have unprecedented technology h=
ere now, already - how do we disentangle outmoded context from immediate op=
portunity?<br><br>- What comes next?: Telework isn&#39;t going away. Orderi=
ng groceries is suddenly the norm. Employees are now minding themselves. Wh=
at other sacred cows are we going to leave behind?<br><br>This is just a ro=
ugh list - the big picture is that we have the opportunity to leverage twen=
