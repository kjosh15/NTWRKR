Hey Mark! Thanks for this; let me know if the below works:

IndigoMetrics helps newly remote workers understand where they stand in
their groups and their organizations, based on the core values of the
company, with a feedback loop to align more closely. It gives management
targeted, real-time insight into how to manage their culture.

Because this is so critical for companies transitioning to the "new
normal," we are offering the next three months free to companies in this
group. More information at www.indigometrics.com!

All best,
Josh
