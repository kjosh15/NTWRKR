We have lots of data relating to different review questions as we collect
question level data and as we ask reviews. It's not pure multivariate
testing as we rarely get to ask different questions to similar employee
pools, but it is useful data.

We are most interested in questions that generate a good level of
dispersion and consistency across participants, and we track how each
question performs against these metrics. We also use this testing to inform
how we suggest questions are worded.

However, at least in the first instance, we have found that it is more
important that the questions reflect the way that culture and values are
defined at the host organization, and the particular language / tone of
voice used.

This is because the formation of the questions themselves embed the target
values / behaviors / tone of voice. So essentially, a question that is
worded correctly according to the definition of values (but produces
sub-optimal data) is better than a question that is worded optimally from a
psychometric data generation perspective but does not reflect the values
and tone of voice of the organization.

Over time, the process of reviewing against the questions can change a way
that an organization defines its target culture and allow us to use more
optimally worded questions =E2=80=93 but we don=E2=80=99t want to force tha=
t process as the
uniqueness of the host culture is the primary reference point that we are
looking to quantify against.

Obviously this all plays into how a company defines itself and revises that
understanding - all stuff that's ripe for Big Spaceship to play with!
Looking forward to more on Monday.

Be well,
- J
