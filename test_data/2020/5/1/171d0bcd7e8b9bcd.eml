en years of technology adoption into six months. Our opportunity to leapfro=

 reaction of many companies is to buy lots of spyware to attempt to keep co=
ntrol. But you don&#39;t have control, and this will get you less.<br><br>-=
 Security: Workers are more autonomous than ever, and BYOD is suddenly the =
norm. There&#39;s HUGE security risk here, as ever but the biggest have not=
hing to do with the tech.<br><br>- All the lego pieces: Robots, IoT, AI, an=
alytics, smartphones... We have unprecedented technology here now, already =
- how do we disentangle outmoded context from immediate opportunity?<br><br=
>- What comes next?: Telework isn&#39;t going away. Ordering groceries is s=
uddenly the norm. Employees are now minding themselves. What other sacred c=
ows are we going to leave behind?<br><br>This is just a rough list - the bi=

the most rapid advancements in technology in human history... or repeat the=
