. Anxiety has always been a part of my life, so when I heard school was clo=
sing due to the coronavirus, I was very scared. See, my mom still had to go=
 to work each day, so I was left home alone with my two dogs. During the =
=EF=AC=81rst week, I would email my mom every five minutes and get furious =
when she didn=E2=80=99t answer right away =E2=80=93 scared that something h=
ad happened, when in reality it was all =EF=AC=81ne. But after the first we=
ek, I realized that this wasn=E2=80=99t so bad! I was more independent and =
I loved it. <br clear=3D"none">&gt;<br clear=3D"none">&gt; Being independen=
t is like getting a power-up in a video game or winning a prize at the claw=
 machine. You=E2=80=99re getting a boost of con=EF=AC=81dence. I made my ow=
n rules and had to decide between right and wrong choices, such as, =E2=80=

=99 (Sometimes I picked ice cream, but you get my point.) <br clear=3D"none=
