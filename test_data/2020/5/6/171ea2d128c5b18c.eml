The boys have been doing school all along, albeit virtually. We got very
lucky in that their school, and particularly Othinn's teacher, has done an
AMAZING job with all the remote work. Also, we paired with another family a
block up the road so our two boys are "doing school" with their two kids
every day, which creates a lot more routine and stability around the
experience. Overall, I'd say it's been a net positive, with all the kids
learning from each other and benefiting from a lot more hands-on time with
parents.

Glad to hear your friend recovered well. Turns out COVID-19 isn't a death
sentence - its fatality rate is much lower than SARS or MERS, for example -
although it's still no joke. As you said, it may be that prayer really did
help!

The weather has been amazing here too, although as you said people are
quite anxious about going out too soon and seeing a very steep second wave.
I think we're going to get exactly that here in the USA, esp. as overall
health (and healthcare) is so generally bad. But, again, these are things
that were broken before - so perhaps this is the impetus to improve things.

Glad you're doing well and benefiting from the retreat!! We're heading to
Iceland in mid-June (assuming flights hold up) so will be thinking of you
as we fly out!
