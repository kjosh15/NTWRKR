Must be a little local store somewhere the author lives I guess.
Yes, we are both fine thanks. A friend in the village got the virus. At 85
and asthmatic and having had cancer two years ago , so still on a dose of
drugs lowering his immunity, it didn't look a good prospect. But hey!  he
is  out of hospital and back home recovering!  The power of prayer eh!
 Hope you guys are OK and keeping the boys happy and occupied. I suppose
they can't go back to school yet - or can they? They are thinking of
opening the schools in the uk for the ten year olds  on the first of June.
People here are quite anxious about going back too soon and having a second
coming of the virus.  The weather is absolutely beautiful and the Spring
flowers have never been lovelier. It is a beautiful retreat time in peace
for us, though  we grieve for all those who are really suffering very badly
alas.  I don't think we shall be able to get out much before Christmas.
MAybe that is the government's goal - to try to get things back to a sort
of normal by then. We'll see!
 Love to you all
 Lyn
