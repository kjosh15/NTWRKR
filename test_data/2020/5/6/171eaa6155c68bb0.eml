Here's hoping you and yours are safe and healthy in these interesting
times!!

I was curious if your place up north is available this fall - we're
planning to come back from Iceland in Sept. and might like a place to be
outside the city.

Let me know how you're doing and if you have any suggestions. We'll get
through this!

All best,
Josh
