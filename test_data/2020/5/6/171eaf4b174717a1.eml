Two points:

1) Again, a million thanks for your enormously generous offer earlier this
year. Fortunately everything seems to have worked out well, and
we're planning to head to Iceland mid-June, with plans to come back in Sept
(assuming they reinstate schools...)

2. How's Venture.co going? What can I do to help, especially given the
disruption we're seeing in the financial world?
