That's amazing!!! You're all doing incredible work here; looking forward to
seeing what you came up with last night! (Apologies for missing it, we had
a sick kid knock us out of everything yesterday.)

I passed this on to Dan and his team at JustFix and will let you know if
they reply - as you can imagine, they're pretty deeply underwater ATM but
it looks amazingly useful!
