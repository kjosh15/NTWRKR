Genius. How about:

"Remote workers are increasingly autonomous -- and stranded!
IndigoMetrics.com helps employees know where they stand and what to
improve, so the company can weather COVID and so can their job. Win/win:
www.indigometrics.com"

As for your DB, have you looked at demographically targeted social media
posting w/ A/B testing to validate the most viral? I.e., set up some
scripts to post combinations of photos and captions to specific
demographics to see which are retweeted/shared the most, and make sure all
have the right linkback to your site. Let me know if that makes sense - I'm
trying to think about how to automate yourself to scale!
