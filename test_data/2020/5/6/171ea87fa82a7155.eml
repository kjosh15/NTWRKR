That's really good to hear!
 I have just closed an online cwrs ( second lesson) learning to write Welsh
poetry. Not really my thing, poetry, but I seem to have registered
inadvertently. As it is free it doesn't matter, and it is quite fun as the
group is small, and on zoom we can break into smaller groups etc very
easily,and actually less distraction than when all in the same room.
 Lucky you going to Iceland in June. Let's hope the flights are going again
by then. DId Iceland close its airports for a time to  gain some control
over the virus outbreak? That would have been a good idea in the UK!

9;s poem expresses gratitude for the simple joy of being alive. I think Gra=
nelli&#39;s must be an American grocery store of some sort, but extensive g=
oogling has only got me as far as a <i>gelateria </i>in Macclesfield, which=
 doesn&#39;t seem to fit with this poem at all!=C2=A0=C2=A0<br clear=3D"all=
"><div><br></div><div>Anyway, the couple in this poem, about whom we are to=
ld nothing, show such tremendous energy and zest for life that we are left =
rather breathless at the end. The poet allows us both to revel in the ecsta=
sy of this dance and to find beauty in everything around them - there is so=
 much loving attention to detail here, from the &quot;<i>peaches / bursting=
 with ripeness in their wicker baskets&quot; </i>to the <i>&quot;goat chees=
e sent down / from some green mountain</i>&quot; and, finally, &quot;<i>the=
 blue sky a sudden surprise.</i>&quot; It is so romantic, and perhaps encou=
rages us to think about how we might waltz to our own music through the day=
 ahead of us, taking in every last detail and sharing some of their <i>joie=
 de vivre.</i>=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Best wishes,</div><div><br></=
