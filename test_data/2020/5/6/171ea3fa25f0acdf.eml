 Genius. How about:

"Remote workers are increasingly autonomous -- and stranded! IndigoMetrics.=
com helps employees know where they stand and what to improve, so the compa=
ny can weather COVID and so can their job. Win/win: www.indigometrics.com"

As for your DB, have you looked at demographically targeted social media po=
sting w/ A/B testing to validate the most viral? I.e., set up some scripts =
to post combinations of photos and captions to specific demographics to see=
 which are retweeted/shared the most, and make sure all have the right link=
back to your site. Let me know if that makes sense - I'm trying to think ab=
out how to automate yourself to scale!

<br clear=3D"none">&gt; L <br clear=3D"none">&gt;<br clear=3D"none">&gt; Hi=
, I=E2=80=99m Sable. I am 12 years old. Anxiety has always been a part of m=
y life, so when I heard school was closing due to the coronavirus, I was ve=
ry scared. See, my mom still had to go to work each day, so I was left home=
 alone with my two dogs. During the =EF=AC=81rst week, I would email my mom=
 every five minutes and get furious when she didn=E2=80=99t answer right aw=
ay =E2=80=93 scared that something had happened, when in reality it was all=
 =EF=AC=81ne. But after the first week, I realized that this wasn=E2=80=99t=
 so bad! I was more independent and I loved it. <br clear=3D"none">&gt;<br =
clear=3D"none">&gt; Being independent is like getting a power-up in a video=
 game or winning a prize at the claw machine. You=E2=80=99re getting a boos=
t of con=EF=AC=81dence. I made my own rules and had to decide between right=
 and wrong choices, such as, =E2=80=98Should I have a healthy option for lu=
nch, or a bowl of ice cream?=E2=80=99 (Sometimes I picked ice cream, but yo=
u get my point.) <br clear=3D"none">&gt;<br clear=3D"none">&gt; I got so in=
to preparing meals that I started to make lunch for my mom and homemade tre=
ats for my dogs. Now that school has moved online, I have to check my schoo=
l email and website for any school work and do it right away so I don=E2=80=
=99t fall behind.<br clear=3D"none">&gt;<br clear=3D"none">&gt; I have lear=
ned that gaining independence is a lot like being a baby bird: You=E2=80=99=

be scary for a few days but you get the hang of it. I know I did. Thank you=
