&gt; You&#39;re too kind<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So I went back to one of the people on this and sounded them out a bit=
 on why Indigo wasn&#39;t in the version they shared. It&#39;s clear it was=
 all from note quite &#39;getting it&#39; when it comes to Indigo. Again, t=
hey brought up you giving Peppercomm a free run with it so we can really ab=
sorb it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I know this sounded worthwhile to you a few weeks ago, not sure if sti=

in, you could create a bunch of Indigo proselytizers with access to a rich =
vein of clients.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you&#39;re open to it, I&#39;ll get things going with my CEO and he=

&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ll defer to you - remember, either way you go, no skin off my as=
