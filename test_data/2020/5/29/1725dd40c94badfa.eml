Ellie,

Thanks for the intro to Marat! He was able to give me some useful context
for KF and where advising sits in that. I'm a little concerned he slotted
me as just a techie developer - he suggested he would talk to his digital
team - but he was able to describe KF's advising around human capital
management in more detail and we did discuss my background and interest in
working with a larger team.

Let me know what next steps should be, and/or if you have any news from
Takeda!

All best,
Josh
