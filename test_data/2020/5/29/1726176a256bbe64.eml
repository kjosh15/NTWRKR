Ha!! Glad to hear you're getting all the mandatory middle-age pleasures in;
I've been working mostly part time for the past decade or so and agree it's
a lot more sane. Stupid that it takes so much work to get into a position
where you can, but perhaps that will be a shift in outlook after Covid...
Somewhere, anyway.

I'm envious of your tax system... we'll see if we head back to the US after
this summer in Iceland. Our kids are in a fabulous school we really love so
we may stick it out if they return to regular attendance. Then again, if
things get even worse (which boggles the mind) then maybe not. In my
experience kids are like a weird kind of drug habit in which you habituate
displacement of ego onto other people in some of the best possible ways,
but it does mean self-sacrifice becomes the norm vs. a sensible, considered
decision making process!

Curious what kind of research you're doing, and are you looking for
international customers?

Best of luck with the travel plans,
Josh
