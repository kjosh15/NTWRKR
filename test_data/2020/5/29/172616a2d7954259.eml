Glad to hear it!! I think you're correct in that innovators and scientists
are more risk-adverse in the EU than the US; remember that our highly
individualist view makes everyone think they're an outlier. (Cough
*Theranos* cough).

That reality of the EU market may be a feature not a bug, however. If you
could combine the PreHype model (I know the founder - check them out!) with
the New Labs model you might be able to get more traction. Or, better yet,
create in-house service firms to deliver on the MVPs in conjunction with
outside talent looking to be acqua-hired. That way you can come in
expecting a regular, full time job doing science or tech with the
potential option of being hired away on a project you're in love with.

Takeda went well - too well. I spoke to the woman looking to hire for 2.5
hours and had to end before she was ready so I could go to the restroom.
She apparently raved about me BUT seemed to feel I might be "too big" for
the role. She expressed interest in my ability to consult, so much so that
I got bumped up to the #2 at Korn Ferry to talk regarding, but he clearly
felt that KF delivered consulting on human capital management - not the
broader tech remit I usually serve. The short version is they need someone
to push numbers and clock hours, but really really loved my vision, which
may mean I don't get to do either. :/

The upside is it's clearer than ever that I can play in an executive
capacity. Now the problem is identifying where/who to do that with. Do you
have any advice?

Hope you all are well!
