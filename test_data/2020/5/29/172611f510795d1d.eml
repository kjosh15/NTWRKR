Update for you-

The Atma digital ID management cloud platform we have discussed has seen
recent traction with MAC brand (ELC). We are deploying 83 locations in
Turkey.  To dive into details there is a bit of ground to cover so if you
think it is interesting I can set up a call with you, Max and myself.  (Max
runs the Atma team)

let me know-
