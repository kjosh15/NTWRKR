The fithit.com site was down from 14:39 to 15:46 EST today, May 29th 2020.
This was because I used MediaTemple's one-click installer to put wordpress
on kravmaga.fithit.com, and the installer laddered up from
kravmaga.fithit.com to fithit.com and overwrote the entire fithit.com site.

During the hour and seven minutes it was down users got a blank page or
"site not found" error (depending on their browser). I was able to
resuscitate a copy of the site I had made before beginning the operation,
but needed to make sure the error wouldn't repeat when I tried to install
wordpress again at kravmaga.fithit.com. Everything should be resolved now
and both sites are independently operational.

My apologies - downtime isn't something I normally consider acceptable and
I'm pursuing the issue with MediaTemple to find out why their service
behaved this way.
