Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple.

I am sorry for any concerns this may be raising. Looking over your website's indigometrics.com SSL status it appears there is no SSL installed. As such, going to the HTTPS of your website will result to an insecure page. You may use the shared SSL certificate that is included with your Grid, covering *.gridserver.com, for email purposes at no additional charge. If you wish to have an SSL certificate for your website, or a subdomain, you can order an SSL certificate from us and use our automated installer, or you can order one from a third-party and install it manually. Please see the following Knowledge Base articles for further detail on these two options:

Ordering an SSL certificate from (mt) Media Temple
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204404454/

Installing an SSL Certificate
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204643710/

Alternatively, you can also go with a third-party SSL vendor to install a SSL to your domain here. Which we do have a guide on how to do so:

GENERATING A SAN SSL CSR
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/360038646712/

INSTALLING A THIRD-PARTY SSL CERTIFICATE
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/360021727071/

Also you can issue out a free Let's Encrypt SSL which are only valid for 90 days and require to re-issue a new one. I am including a KnowledgeBase article in regards to this for reference below:

INSTALL A LET'S ENCRYPT SSL
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/208603976
