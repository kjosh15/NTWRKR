Firstly, thanks for producing masks when people need them so badly!

Secondly, I ordered mine on May 7th, expecting to get them in 5-7 business
days as advertised on your site. I only need it until the end of the month.
Is it going to arrive before then, and either way how do I get reimbursed?
Unless it lands tomorrow (and the USPS site indicates it's still in CA)
it's not going to be much use to me. :(

Many thanks,
Josh
