Managed to put everything into the deck and did a quick run through - came
out at about 15m so we're in the right ballpark. Would love to substantiate
this with any case studies, references, or quotes you guys might have, and
tightening the focus to tee up a conversation around the opportunity ahead
of us is going to be really huge.

I see Sarah's already put in a bunch of comments: I'm going to grab lunch
and loop back in. Stoked!!

 stands in their mind as emblematic of a wise, impactful response=C2=A0to t=
