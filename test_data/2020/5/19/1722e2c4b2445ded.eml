It's been almost a decade; no idea what's going with DREAM:In, but I did
note that you're now the Mentor-In-Residence at NEW INC's incubator. I'm
doing a lot of work advising senior executives, and now more than ever
they're keen to get access to smart new thinkers. Do you have time to
connect briefly in the coming weeks to catch up?

All best wishes,
Josh
