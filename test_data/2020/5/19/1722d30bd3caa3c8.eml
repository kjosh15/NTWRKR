&gt;<br>

&gt; Wow, I so feel this-- we are also very close to the hospital where thi=

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; eh maybe-- i prefer mostly remote, would be cool to do CD work, resear=

&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>

9;re<br>
&gt;&gt; five blocks from Elmherst hospital (the epicenter in NYC) so<br>
&gt;&gt; everything just fell over. Now all my speeches for the year are<br=
>
&gt;&gt; cancelled and we&#39;re still trying to close one or two contracts=
...<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Am I understanding right that your best target is as an artist/des=
ign<br>
&gt;&gt; lead in a research arm of a big company? I don&#39;t want to waste=
 your<br>
&gt;&gt; time, but I&#39;m currently doing a ton of networking outreach, mo=
stly to<br>
&gt;&gt; senior execs for large multinationals. If you can help me position=
<br>
&gt;&gt; what you really want to do I can probably suggest you as a strateg=
ic<br>
&gt;&gt; initiative - but I&#39;m not going to be especially useful for gen=
eric<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;need a PM?&quot; asks.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; That said, I&#39;m of course happy to keep my eyes peeled and mout=
h open<br>
&gt;&gt; about your availability - my ongoing posit is that folks who can<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; thrive doing remote work in uncertain environments with strong<br>
&gt;&gt; technology chops are going to become the new global elite workforc=
e,<br>
&gt;&gt; which is to say I&#39;m happy to pitch you as a highly desirable p=
eer!<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Let me know if I can help further,<br>
&gt;&gt; Josh<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hey Josh!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ive been learning arabic/farsi/moroccan because I am spending=
 a lot of my free time roaming around in N and NE Africa and I find that Fr=
ench and various forms of Farsi are really key there to interacting and get=
ting around in rural areas .. I also would like to spend more time in the m=
iddle east when all this mess clears up. .<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The virus here has been nuts-- the Austrian Alps were sort of=
 ground zero outside of Italy and since we are like 20 mins for the border,=
 everything went on red alert like mid-March and we have basically been on =
total lockdown since.. its def been a test of sanity to not be able to real=
ly go outside and play :) The kids are dealing with it fine as long as I ke=
ep the steam subscription up ;) how are you guys doing?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; As for what I want to do-- tbh-- I was basically offered a jo=
b at MSFT research at a group called Area 51 in Feb as an artist/design lea=
d but at the time they needed me there immediately and I wasn&#39;t able to=
 commit to moving-- then 2 week later COVID hit and I lost all my exhibitio=
n schedules for the next 18 months and everything shut down in the period o=
f 48 hours.. sort of deer in headlight me. I&#39;ve been applying to techni=
cal writer positions, growth communication leads, project management and cr=
eation direction roles.. even a few social media jobs.. I have spent the la=
st 10 years doing some combination of those things-- and feel confident in =
all those aspects (even fundraising but I hate that and have been trying to=
 avoid jobs where I have to beg people for money for other people: ) )<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Why are you learning Farsi?<br>
