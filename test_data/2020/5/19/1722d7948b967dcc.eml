Great, just received and looked over. Makes a lot of sense. Will leave in a
couple comments for potential builds, but we can start putting the deck
outline together based on what you already have.

On that last slide in the deck I sent...I have no doubt we can rework the
existing RTBs and make them more compelling with a little more time,
research, and copy love :)

And yes, love that breakdown of "radical alignment." Do you envision that
being integrated in the presentation? I can see it coming through in
section 3. What do you think?
