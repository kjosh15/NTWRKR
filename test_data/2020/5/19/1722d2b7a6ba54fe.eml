Amen to all of that - a wild ride hardly summarizes. Curious
where/what you've done!

Do you know Big Spaceship? We (www.indigometrics.com) are partnering
with them for branding/marketing strategy; I know they're not hiring
just yet, but def. good people to know as we expect them to be one of
the survivors and they're building in some interesting pivots (hence
the partnership.)
