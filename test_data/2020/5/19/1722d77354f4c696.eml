&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Icelandair is a partner of JetBlue&#39;s, but if nothing e=
lse Iceland is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; positioning itself to lead the charge in reopening for tou=
rism across<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the atlantic. I&#39;m being introduced to the head of the =
airport and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already know a number of congressmen who could greenlight =
how this is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set up. This could act as a bulwark case study for Ellipsi=
s in the EU.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ancillary to that, a VC friend of mine there is asking me =
to help him<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce the airport to Abbott to try to get their 5m COV=
ID tests<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; integrated into the process. I&#39;d like to pitch to both=
 Abbott and the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Icelandic airport that Normative run the integration - the=
 ideal use<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case would be testing at the gate with results by the time=
 you get to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; border control. At present they&#39;re planning to start t=
esting at the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; airport June 15th, delivering results (hopefully) the same=
 day<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (meaning you have inbound passengers already in the countr=
y and their<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hotels by the time they find out they&#39;ve been infectin=
g everyone.)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#39;re finalizing all plans by the end of May, so the=
 time to act on<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is now.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that there will be hardware and software components =
and EU<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; privacy requirements, as well as medical devices and the p=
ossibility<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Ellipsis integration, it seems like an ideal case for N=
ormative to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deliver the whole shebang. That&#39;s assuming we can make=
 the right pitch<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and bring the right people to the table in the next week o=
r two.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m continuing to dig into this, but if it&#39;s beyon=
d Normative&#39;s scope<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right now I&#39;m happy to just connect the icelandic airp=
ort to Abbot and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be done with it. (There&#39;s no guarantee Abbott will bit=
e given how much<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they&#39;re chewing on just trying to deliver to the US.) =
Let me know if<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this appeals!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consider this some arm-twisting - I&#39;m super stoked abo=
ut all this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; potential but need to get a contract in place!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All best,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Josh<br>
