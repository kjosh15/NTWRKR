Long time no speak - almost five years now! Would be curious to hear if
your son stayed with tech...

That said, the main reason I'm writing is to see if you think there's a
place for a new technology I've developed to help identify where employees
are and aren't acting according to a company's values - including adhering
to safety protocols. We'd like to know if the hospitality industry is a
good potential customer.

Let me know if this piques your interest and if so if you have time for a
short call to compare notes! These are interesting times indeed, but there
is potential out there for those that seize the initiative...

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
