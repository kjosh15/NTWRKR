Farhana,

We met when I was doing some work at Verizon with Janet Schijns, ages and
ages ago. I've since been talking with the CMO of Abbott (who have a
wearable continuous glucose monitor) and the CIO of Sutter Health around
the future of wearable health. If you're available, I'd love to hear how
you're growing your portfolio and if you think there's room for more
medical / wellness monitoring technology as part of it - either through
entirely new devices, or via data analytics. And of course it would be
great to hear how Verizon is growing!

Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the next couple weeks.

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
