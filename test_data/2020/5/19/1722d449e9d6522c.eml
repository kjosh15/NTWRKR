This is great!! I'm dumping my outline for tomorrow's event into a google
doc so you can see it as I make changes - look for an invite shortly.

Otherwise your deck was very helpful, especially the lackluster last slide
- oomph!!

As for "*Radical alignment that builds resilience" *I'm down with "radical
alignment." However, I think the reason I like it is because of the ways in
which it can manifest - organically (bottom up, which is very unusual and
allows for a "nurture an ecosystem" approach), dynamically (because it's
always changing in response to new market conditions, projects, team
assembly, etc.), and autonomously (because our system can scale so well
while generating ongoing increased alignment).

What do you think?
