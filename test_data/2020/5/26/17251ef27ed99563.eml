Been thinking about this. It would be lovely to offer Sonali and Scott a
new (and newly installed) standing AC, but it's looking like it'll cost us
~$50 plus a bunch of time to set it up. I'd suggest we install our standard
AC units and leave the standing unit with an invitation for them to install
it themselves if they like. Otherwise it'll just be a sunk cost for us,
especially if we don't end up spending another spring in NYC in this
apartment. Thoughts?

xoxo,
Josh
