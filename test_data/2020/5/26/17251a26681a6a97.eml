Glad you guys are doing well. We're still in NYC, about ten blocks from
Elmherst hospital (the epicenter of the epicenter), but are planning to
head to Iceland in another week or so. Then the question is whether to come

What kind of freelance work are you doing? Always happy to promote good
people!

All best,
Josh
