Sweets,

I decided to try writing down the mitigating factors involved in moving
away from NYC this fall (or not) so we know what to look for to decide one
way or another. Here's what I came up with so far. Can you take a look and
let me know if I'm missing anything? My goal is just to frame up the
conversation between you and I in planning our next couple years!

   - Trump re-elected (December)
   - School opening this fall / solely remote
   - Safety indicators:
      - second waves; likelihood of another big one
      - food chain issues
      - crime/fire dept/police dept.

xoxo,
Josh
