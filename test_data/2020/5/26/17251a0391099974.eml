I recently gave a talk to the Icelandic Future Committee. Interesting
feedback, but definitely outlines the challenge that most of the political
creatures there have a view that is only as large as their neighborhood.
Food for later conversation.

Separately, looks like R.vik is already looking to deploy a design
school/facility:

Let me know if you're progressed anything prior to your heading over there!

All best,
Josh
