Based on what I heard on the Icelandic news last night we would want
Abbott's ID Now platform, which can perform tests in 5-15m. The
logistics are slightly harder to manage as the ID Now platforms are
typically single units instead of large banks, but regardless they
should be faster than shipping tests to the hospital.

The ideal use case I'd like to pitch for is testing at the gate with
results at border control. The initial MVP would simply tag results to
a passport # for review at the border crossing, but later editions
could deliver results via Iceland's track-and-trace app, making that a
requirement for entering and visiting the country. Either way, if
Iceland is looking to hold itself up as an example for the
international community, getting results to passengers before they
actually enter the country and travel to a hotel would certainly have
better optics (and health outcomes).

Again, I want to be clear that Abbot hasn't specifically requested a
formal RFP - this is all based on my conversations with their
Marketing Director and his initial enthusiasm about the idea. Given
Iceland's leading position on the topic I'm hopeful that we can get
their attention. Let me know what you think and what you're hearing
from your associates at the airport and elsewhere!

All best,
Josh
