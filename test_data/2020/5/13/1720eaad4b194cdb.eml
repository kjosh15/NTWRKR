FWIW, I have a development team with extensive experience with medical
devices and data security that can cover the hardware, software, and
process integration. They can pull together a proposal for Abbot that
ticks all the boxes assuming there's commitment by the
airport/Icelandic gov't. I'll be arriving June 12th (assuming all
flights proceed as planned from NY!) and can help on the ground as
well.

Let me know what you hear - this could be a game changer for Iceland
(not least in keeping the virus out)!!

All best,
Josh
