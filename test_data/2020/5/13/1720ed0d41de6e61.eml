I followed your instructions with the following results:

1. deactivate all of your plugins except for Elementor

Deactivating ALL plugins (including Elementor) caused the weird YouTube
video to disappear. (It also made the site look like ass, as you'd expect.)
Turning the Elementor plugin back on did not cause it to reappear.

2. switch your theme temporarily to a default WordPress theme like
twenty-nineteen

Switching to twenty-nineteen theme did not cause it to reappear.

3. see if the Youtube video issue still happens.

Nope.

4. If not, you can activate your theme again to test, then

Reactivated the Bifrost theme and the video did not reappear.

5. activate your plugins one by one so we can find the culprit.

Activating the Slider Revolution plugin caused the video to return. Also,
the website as a whole no longer looks correct - there is a "Home" title at
the top of the page, and the formatting for the rest of the site is also
all off. The Slider Revolution plugin was part of the theme, IIR.

Please advise.

Thanks!
Josh
