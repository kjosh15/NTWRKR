Excellent news!

So a few things:

1) A proposed definition for our exclusivity: "creative and strategic
services related to internal and external business transformation, customer
& employee experience and engagement, design & user experience of products
and services, branding and purpose definition." We do a lot of stuff. If
that's too broad, tell me where and I'll try to work through it.

2) The MVP brand is a little harder to pin down because we don't know what
to prioritize. Could you write a super simple brief with what you feel you
need, and which aspects have urgency/time drivers? Then we can figure out a
plan that balances more pressing needs with our normal process.

3) Can you fill me in on the pricing structure/matrix and roughly how your
contracts are structured?

4) When you say "work the messaging and collateral to drive this traffic
through Big Spaceship" how do you mean?

Thanks
M
