Let me know where you guys stand on paperwork for Ellipsis and the
growth work we discussed previously. I'd like to be ready to hit the
ground running in the next week or two if possible, which means we
need some numbers and a contract to discuss.

Separately, another (possibly two) opportunities:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/iceland-to-test-visitors-upon-arrival-at-keflavik-airport

Icelandair is a partner of JetBlue's, but if nothing else Iceland is
positioning itself to lead the charge in reopening for tourism across
the atlantic. I'm being introduced to the head of the airport and
already know a number of congressmen who could greenlight how this is
set up. This could act as a bulwark case study for Ellipsis in the EU.

Ancillary to that, a VC friend of mine there is asking me to help him
introduce the airport to Abbott to try to get their 5m COVID tests
integrated into the process. I'd like to pitch to both Abbott and the
Icelandic airport that Normative run the integration - the ideal use
case would be testing at the gate with results by the time you get to
border control. At present they're planning to start testing at the
airport June 15th, delivering results (hopefully) the same day
(meaning you have inbound passengers already in the country and their
hotels by the time they find out they've been infecting everyone.)
They're finalizing all plans by the end of May, so the time to act on
this is now.

Given that there will be hardware and software components and EU
privacy requirements, as well as medical devices and the possibility
of Ellipsis integration, it seems like an ideal case for Normative to
deliver the whole shebang. That's assuming we can make the right pitch
and bring the right people to the table in the next week or two.

I'm continuing to dig into this, but if it's beyond Normative's scope
right now I'm happy to just connect the icelandic airport to Abbot and
be done with it. (There's no guarantee Abbott will bite given how much
they're chewing on just trying to deliver to the US.) Let me know if
this appeals!

Consider this some arm-twisting - I'm super stoked about all this
potential but need to get a contract in place!

All best,
Josh
