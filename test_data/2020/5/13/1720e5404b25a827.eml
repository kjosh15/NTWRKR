Hey Josh!

ive been learning arabic/farsi/moroccan because I am spending a lot of my
free time roaming around in N and NE Africa and I find that French and
various forms of Farsi are really key there to interacting and getting
around in rural areas .. I also would like to spend more time in the middle
east when all this mess clears up. .

The virus here has been nuts-- the Austrian Alps were sort of ground zero
outside of Italy and since we are like 20 mins for the border, everything
went on red alert like mid-March and we have basically been on total
lockdown since.. its def been a test of sanity to not be able to really go
outside and play :) The kids are dealing with it fine as long as I keep the
steam subscription up ;) how are you guys doing?

As for what I want to do-- tbh-- I was basically offered a job at MSFT
research at a group called Area 51 in Feb as an artist/design lead but at
the time they needed me there immediately and I wasn't able to commit to
moving-- then 2 week later COVID hit and I lost all my exhibition schedules
for the next 18 months and everything shut down in the period of 48 hours..
sort of deer in headlight me. I've been applying to technical writer
positions, growth communication leads, project management and creation
direction roles.. even a few social media jobs.. I have spent the last 10
years doing some combination of those things-- and feel confident in all
those aspects (even fundraising but I hate that and have been trying to
avoid jobs where I have to beg people for money for other people: ) )
