Good news; World 50 has asked me to not just do a podcast, but host a
session on the future of work highlighting our platform as the reason for
my being the expert in the room. They'll take the event and turn it into a
written summary and an audio download for all members.

They'd like to do it next week, but I've pushed for the week after. If we
move quickly, we could still work the messaging and collateral to drive
this traffic through Big Spaceship. Let us know what you think!

All best,
Josh

P.S. CNBC is still courting me as a contributor; my impression is that they
know they want something smarter than what they're quoting right now, but
are too caught up in stimulus packages and case load numbers to
understand what yet. We'll get there!
