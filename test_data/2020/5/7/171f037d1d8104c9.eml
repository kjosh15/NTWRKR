Hope you're safe and well! Let me know what you're up to and / or if you'd
like to connect. Since the pandemic I've been slowly walking backwards to
the people who have influenced me in positive ways but who I haven't talked
to in too long. Would be delighted to hear from you!

All best,
Josh
