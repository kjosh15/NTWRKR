Thanks for the suggestion; I was able to determine that I had to adjust my
memory settings in my local php.ini file, which seems to have done the
trick.

One other question, however: at the bottom of the page at
http://www.h4xindustries.com/MANI/ a YouTube video appears. Often, it
multipllies the more you interact with the page. How can I get rid of it?
I've tried duplicating the page and deleting each section until nothing
exists except for the menu framework (a template) and it still appears.
I've also looked at the menu template and can't find any sign of it. Help?

Thanks much,
Josh

- The CORS policy.<br>
<br>
It seems to only be an error in calling a placeholder image (appears when I=
 reload the editing page where the save error appears):<br>
<br>
(Access to image at &#39;<a href=3D"http://placehold.it/1920x1080" target=
=3D"_blank">http://placehold.it/1920x1080</a>&#39; from origin &#39;<a href=
=3D"http://www.h4xindustries.com" target=3D"_blank">http://www.h4xindustrie=
s.com</a>&#39; has been blocked by CORS policy: No &#39;Access-Control-Allo=
w-Origin&#39; header is present on the requested resource.)<br>
<br>
If this is a policy issue, why wasn&#39;t this a problem before? I was edit=
ing away happily until yesterday afternoon when the problem suddenly appear=
ed. Secondary to this, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely that my hosting pr=
ovider is going to change their CORS policy; is this ignorable?<br>
<br>
- Switch your theme (temporarily) to a default WP theme such as Twenty Sixt=
een and see if it makes any difference.<br>
<br>
Tried this; it didn&#39;t change the behavior.<br>
<br>
- If the above didn&#39;t help, please also send us your system info file (=
Elementor &gt; System Info) so we can check your current WordPress environm=
ent. There&#39;s a &#39;Download&#39; button at the bottom.<br>
<br>
Please find attached.<br>
<br>
- 500 errors are server issues and can occur for many reasons. And we will =
need the PHP error logs of your server to determine the cause of the proble=
m.<br>
<br>
I have them; let me know what timespan you need to see and if you need me t=
o run through any actions on the site/tools to see what they generate befor=
e sending them over.<br>
<br>
While you&#39;re here, I&#39;m also having a problem where a youtube video =
is embedded at the bottom of the landing page. I cannot find where the vide=
o is inserted, and have deleted all the blocks and it still appears. Any ti=
ps on hunting it down to remove it?<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!<br>
Josh<br>

<br>
<br>So far I&#39;ve debugged as per <a href=3D"https://docs.elementor.com/a=

<br>
<br>- Erase some sections in the page that you are trying to save and see i=
f it enables you to perform the action (you can retrieve them by using the =
revision history of Elementor).=20
<br>
<br>I erased all the sections of the page; the problem persisted.
<br>
<br>
<br>- Increase the WP memory limit. You can fit the memory limit to our req=
uirements and activate the debug mode of WordPress to check how many MB you=
 need exactly. Although you can do it by yourself, it is preferable to cont=
act your hosting provider for further assistance.=20
<br>
<br>Current memory limit is 256, the max recommended by Elementor docs.
<br>
<br>
<br>- Sometimes, saving issues can happen when the admin-ajax.php script ti=
meouts. You can know if it is the issue by checking the error messages appe=
aring in your browser console. The error message, in this case, is Failed t=
o load resource: the server responded with a status of 413. When you experi=
ence this problem, add the following directives to your .htaccess file to i=
ncrease the dynamic timeout:=20
<br>&lt;IfModule mod_dtimeout.c&gt; &lt;Files ~ &quot;.php&quot;&gt; SetEnv=
If Request_URI &quot;admin-ajax.php&quot; DynamicTimeout=3D150 &lt;/Files&g=
t; &lt;/IfModule&gt;
<br>
<br>Watching the console, I found the error was:=20
<br>
<br>VM5878:1 POST <a href=3D"http://www.mysite.com/MANI/wp-admin/admin-ajax=

/a> 500 (Internal Server Error)
<br>
<br>I added the line requested to .htaccess in the root of my wordpress dir=
ectory. No luck.
<br>
<br>I did not divide my work into a few templates and paste them into anoth=
er page, nor added an SSL certification as neither are an option at this ti=
me. What else should I try?

.<br> <br> <br> - Increase the WP memory limit. You can fit the memory limi=
t to our requirements and activate the debug mode of WordPress to check how=
 many MB you need exactly. Although you can do it by yourself, it is prefer=
able to contact your hosting provider for further assistance. <br> <br> Cur=

meouts. You can know if it is the issue by checking the error messages appe=
aring in your browser console. The error message, in this case, is Failed t=

ence this problem, add the following directives to your .htaccess file to i=
ncrease the dynamic timeout: <br> &lt;IfModule mod_dtimeout.c&gt; &lt;Files=
