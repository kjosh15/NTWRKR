 on yesterday=E2=80=99s Summit.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09 =


=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Member Takeaways

=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Trust is very much at play here through this crisis. I=E2=80=
=99ve got a strong feeling that both politicians and corporations will be j=
udged after this period as to how they behaved, whether they were truthful,=
 and if they did what they said they would.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09The three guests sent the message of common sense and doing the right=
 things. Going back to these is so important during this crisis.=20

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Search for the simple offering through the under=
standing of the complexity we are in.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Ho=
w to continue the journey we are on=E2=80=94driving more accountability and=
 agility when we aren=E2=80=99t in crisis mode. As we do this, it really do=
es unleash human potential. Also, not getting ahead of ourselves to predict=
 the future, but double down on learning in spaces we know will emerge.
=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The world focuses on zero-sum games; we sh=
ould not think about this and instead focus on what we would want to be. Wh=
ether it=E2=80=99s Ren=C3=A9e, Hubert or Walter, it seems that they all bel=
ieved there was a value in imagining the future we want to build.

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09I=E2=80=99m super encouraged by the overall view=
 that there is true opportunity here=E2=80=94politically, economically, and=
 especially in our businesses=E2=80=94and that we have techniques for achie=
ving that.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Good reminder of the value of=
 these connections. Lots of good ideas, but also lots of good reminders (ke=
ep it simple, unlock the power in humans, etc.).=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Businesses will be judged on how they behave.

=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09I will take back that our positive mindset will need to c=
ontinuously evolve to build a better world.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09The importance of collaboration, humility and vulnerability as leader=
ship traits (rather than the =E2=80=9Csuperhero=E2=80=9D of old).

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09It=E2=80=99s an opportunity to reset and set the=
 stage for the next 10 years.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Some commo=
n themes around trust, facts, collaboration, simplicity and leading with a =
sense of purpose. Doing what=E2=80=99s right.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09Walter Isaacson

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Professor, Tulane Univer=
sity; Author, Leonardo da Vinci, The Innovators and Steve Jobs

=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Drawing from the lives of history=E2=80=99s greatest v=
isionaries=E2=80=94Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs, to na=
me a few=E2=80=94author Walter Isaacson explored the traits and practices c=
reative geniuses have in common and uncovered how to glean lessons from the=
 past to impact the future.

SKuAWTbEGI

=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The ultimate intersect=
ion :: What common thread runs through the many geniuses Isaacson has studi=
ed? They=E2=80=99re all imaginative, creative and innovative=E2=80=94and mu=
ltidisciplinary. =E2=80=9CThey all stood at the intersection of the arts an=
d sciences,=E2=80=9D he said, and they could see patterns across different =
disciplines. Steve Jobs would say that creativity occurs when you stand at =
the intersection of art and technology. The other key trait they have in co=
mmon? They had a =E2=80=9Cwild curiosity for its own sake.=E2=80=9D They we=
re all passionately inquisitive about anything and everything; they had =
=E2=80=9Cthe driven curiosity to stop and observe things.=E2=80=9D

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Simplicity in design :: While most people think =
of design as a surface attribute, da Vinci and Jobs knew that =E2=80=9Cthe =
essence of great design meant you had to go below the surface.=E2=80=9D The=
y believed that =E2=80=9Csimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.=
=E2=80=9D Thus, to achieve simplicity and beautiful design, you must fully =
understand the complexity beneath it. Da Vinci studied the complex inner wo=
rkings of the human body in order to paint the beautiful, seemingly simple =
smile of Mona Lisa. Jobs iterated over and over again in order to achieve t=
he intuitive, sleek design of the iPhone

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09The physical and the digital :: The pandemic launched a massive experime=
nt in remote work, and executives are now charged with leading their organi=
zations=E2=80=99 reopening plans. Isaacson noted that Jobs was fanatical ab=
out creating opportunities for people to meet in real life. Apple headquart=
ers=E2=80=99 unique ring shape was designed to create moments for employees=
 to meet spontaneously. He believed that bumping into each other would sere=
ndipitously spark new ideas. In the post-COVID-19 world, we=E2=80=99ll have=
 to figure out how to balance physical and digital experiences to get the b=
est from both.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09A source of optimism :: W=
hile every issue is immediately polarized even amid a global crisis, Isaacs=
on shared what gives him optimism for the future: Gen Z, whom he believes m=
ight be better called the Corona Generation. His students have been very en=
gaged in helping the community around them. COVID-19 is shaping this genera=
tion. =E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re feeling that they=E2=80=99re all in this tog=
ether as a new generation.=E2=80=9D He=E2=80=99s hopeful that in the future=
, when facing another major crisis, =E2=80=9Cthat they will be less bitter =
and partisan and divisive than we are when they attack and approach social =
and civic issues.=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The question =
you should ask :: Isaacson reflected on the recovery efforts in New Orleans=
 after Hurricane Katrina. =E2=80=9CAt a certain point, we said, =E2=80=
=98The question is not: How do we rebuild the city we had? But the question=
 is: How do we build the city we want to have?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D He encoura=
ged members to apply this to their own companies and ask, =E2=80=9CHow are =
we going not just to restore our company but build our company new in a dif=
ferent way and use this crisis as an opportunity?=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Member Perspectives:

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09To get to simplicity, you have to understand the complexity.

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Take the opportunity to build the future you =
want.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09His emphasis on the scientific =
method was very important. We immediately have our preconceived notions, bu=
t we should make sure we stay with the scientific method and test out ideas=

Executive Chairman and Former CEO,=
 Best Buy; Director, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Ralph Lauren

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09As CEO of Best Buy, Hubert Joly built a culture of custom=
er engagement and transformative leadership that resulted in resurrecting t=
he company as an electronics leader, and he joined members to connect the d=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Leading in the current crisis :: The pandemic has been a major =
global shock, and companies will be impacted differently by industry and ge=
ography. =E2=80=9CThis is an invitation for all of us to have our finest ho=
ur,=E2=80=9D said Joly. Supply chains will likely be reconfigured, and the =
era of unlimited globalization has ended. The relationships between busines=
s, governments and society will evolve. Many companies won=E2=80=99t just h=
ave to restart; they=E2=80=99ll have to reset. The world is moving into a n=
ew era, =E2=80=9Cbut nobody has a script.=E2=80=9D Leaders must use resilie=
nce and agility to prepare for and navigate this new normal.

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Purpose and humanity :: Many of the principles Joly re=
lied on while leading Best Buy=E2=80=99s turnaround are applicable for exec=
utives steering their organizations through the COVID-19 crisis. =E2=80=
=9CIt=E2=80=99s the idea of putting people and customers first, and treatin=
g profit as an outcome as opposed to the main goal.=E2=80=9D Navigating an =
organization through crisis requires leading with both purpose and humanity=
. When leaders use purpose as a lens, they move from dangerous zero-sum gam=
es and begin to see new possibilities and opportunities for growth. He reco=
mmended the book The Art of Possibilities

. Prioritizing humanity, connecting with empl=
oyees and =E2=80=9Cusing all parts of our skills=E2=80=94left brain, right =
brain, heart and soul=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94are the ways businesses can create =
=E2=80=9Cirrational performance=E2=80=9D in uncertain times.

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Unleashing human magic :: As a leader, he said, =
=E2=80=9CDefining what to do is usually relatively easy, defining how to do=
 it is a bit harder, and it=E2=80=99s doing it that=E2=80=99s the hard part=
.=E2=80=9D To effectively do what must be done, you must mobilize your orga=
nization by focusing on =E2=80=9Cunleashing human magic=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94helping connect what drives the individuals within your company with the=
 organization=E2=80=99s purpose. Focus on building authentic human connecti=
ons, creating a growth environment and pushing decision-making down in the =
organization as much as possible.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The=
 questions you should ask :: Joly shared with members three questions they =
should ask themselves, their teams and their organizations during this cris=
is.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09How are you taking care of yourse=
lf? This crisis requires you to be the best leader you can be. Are you spen=
ding enough time thinking about how you want to lead and how you want to be=
 remembered? Are you taking care of yourself physically, mentally and spiri=
tually?=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09How are your team members ta=
king care of themselves? Joly encouraged members to ask the above questions=
 to each person on their teams. =E2=80=9CWe all need to get to know the peo=
ple around us on a much deeper level than we ever have.=E2=80=9D

=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09What changes are impacting us? On the busines=
s and strategy level, he said, =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s make sure we list all=
 of the changes that are impacting our industry and business, and what it m=
eans to do something about this.=E2=80=9D=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09Member Perspectives:

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Take care of =
your =E2=80=9Cmind, soul and body.=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09Our role is to unleash human magic=E2=80=94purpose, humanity, resi=
lience.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The soft skills, women are ma=
king better global decisions. Humanity is making a comeback.

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09It really makes me think about the impact on supply=

yMh1mMc6FeEY4W8qae-oB1WSKuAWTbEGI

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Link t=
echnology to value :: Mauborgne argued that there=E2=80=99s a remarkable co=
nfusion between technological innovation and value innovation. =E2=80=9CTec=
hnology innovation doesn=E2=80=99t create new markets; it only creates new =
markets when it=E2=80=99s applied to the value consumers use.=E2=80=9D Tech=
nology often gets pushed first without considering if it=E2=80=99s strategi=
cally priced for the market, if it=E2=80=99s simple and easy to use, or if =
it improves users=E2=80=99 lives. =E2=80=9CHow do you link technology to va=
lue? The companies that create blue oceans always start with the value to t=
he market and work backward from there.=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09Six ways to reconstruct markets :: Companies tend to innovate in t=
he same way as their competitors because they benchmark against each other.=
 As an alternative, Mauborgne shared six ways to reshape market boundaries =
and apply blue-ocean thinking.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Acros=
s industries: Look across alternative industries instead of at the competit=
ion within your own industry.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Across=
 strategic groups: Look across strategic groups. =E2=80=9CInstead of focusi=
ng on a strategic group within an industry, why do people trade up and down=
 between two strategic groups?=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09Buyer group: What value would you see if you switched the buyer group?=


=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Complementary products and services:=
 =E2=80=9CWe tend to focus on only one product or service.=E2=80=9D Where a=
re there complementary products and services?

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09Functional and emotional: Can you take a functional product and ma=
ke it emotional, or vice versa? Can you switch those two within an industry=
?

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Time: Can you understand the irreve=
rsible trends in your industry, seeing analogous industries that have gone =
through those trends, and then identify how you can change value today to m=
eet that trend as it develops.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Who isn=
=E2=80=99t your customer? :: Mauborgne emphasized the idea that blue-ocean =
strategy isn=E2=80=99t about talking more with your customer; it=E2=80=
=99s about connecting with the people who are not your customers. =E2=80=
=9CWhy do they refuse your industry, refuse your product or service? What i=
s it that=E2=80=99s keeping them away? Anyone=E2=80=99s customers are just =
a drop in the bucket from the universe of non-customers.=E2=80=9D How can y=
ou convert them to become your customers?

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09The questions you should ask :: She shared two questions that members sh=
ould be asking within their organizations to help move from red to blue oce=
ans. As you plan to emerge from this crisis, ask: =E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s t=
he one thing we=E2=80=99ve been doing that we could eliminate to drop our c=
ost structure?=E2=80=9D The second question should be asked not only to the=
 innovation team but to the front line. Ask: =E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s the on=
e thing we should raise or create that we don=E2=80=99t offer today to meet=
 the market where it is?=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Member=
 Perspectives:

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09It=E2=80=99s interesti=
ng that some new markets that have been created have suffered the most. The=
 gig economy where companies like Airbnb or Uber don=E2=80=99t actually hav=
e or build anything; they are a facilitator.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09If you use a human-centered design process, everything should be v=
alue-based.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09We have found that you ha=
ve to improve the consumer experience in a meaningful way and also have a w=
ide moat to protect it over time to build value, which requires tech. Need =
both.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Clay Christensen=E2=80=99s job-=
to-be-done model always resonates with me, bringing people back to the prob=
lem or job being solved and away from solution or technology focus.=20

=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Currently in our markets, the value priori=
ties are rapidly moving to safety and security.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09We ask what high-value problem a new product or service is goin=
g to address to keep value as a centerpiece of innovation.

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09One of our biggest challenges is identifying true p=
ain points and meaningful improvements. Consumers rarely can articulate the=
ir true needs or the needs of the future, but when they see it and if it=
=E2=80=99s intuitive, they buy in quickly.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09Agree. Especially considering unarticulated needs coming from new tou=
ch points and usage occasions coming from this new normal.

=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09We are using a central group to identify shifts and=
 then having each business unit think about what it means for them. For tho=
se that are further out, we have our ventures team work it, or we have our =
corporate resources partner with the business unit.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09We have split internal (sustaining innovation) from disru=
ptive innovation and included CVC.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Se=
ems that blue ocean strategy needs big, free, open thinking as opposed to i=
nnovation in large, established companies that rely on process and =
=E2=80=9Cmeetings=E2=80=9D to help make big thinking happen at scale. Actua=
lly all a human/company transformation problem rather than an issue around =
technology or new markets.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Our centra=
l research team is meant to evaluate and identify trends that could impact =
our businesses, but then quickly support business units=E2=80=99 incorporat=
ion of change where relevant.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09This q=
uestion of how do you identify the megatrends that will amplify existing bu=
sinesses, demanding shifts in how we deliver value versus those opportuniti=
es that demand incubation of fundamentally new businesses is a critical one=
.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09We are making great progress having=
 each of our business units do a forward-looking exercise on where the cons=
umer and technology is going and what the big opportunity spaces are for th=
em and then leveraging lean innovation to learn. Separate from running core=
 business but gives them access to the consumer and business knowledge that=
 arrives.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Sometimes technology breakt=
hroughs can inspire thinking about new consumer value possibilities. =20
=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09We call this, =E2=80=9CThink big, test =
small, fail fast, learn quick.=E2=80=9D

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09My company has created an internally facing design thinking team that ha=
s developed a set of ideation and brainstorming sessions called =E2=80=
=9Cinnoventions=E2=80=9D that are used to help the core business gain clari=
ty at a very granular level around product road maps based on research, bus=
iness insights and consumer feedback.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09New technology can create entirely new uncontested spaces; what a satell=
ite will be able to do within the next five years is amazing. IP in such sp=
aces will be important.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Trusted brand=
s will matter when safety and security are top of mind.

=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Brand and reputation will matter, safety and its perce=
ption thereof, will drive growth and consumer confidence.

=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09The biggest challenge is courage to act. We are making=
 real progress starting small with lean innovation.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09Growing new markets is the biggest value creator. New market=
s do take time=E2=80=94so critical to keep core business healthy, too.
=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Big businesses struggle because there a=
re a lot of processes, and those get in the way of people doing blue ocean.=
 Blue oceans aren=E2=80=99t obvious; it=E2=80=99s not more of what you do o=
r better than what you do. It=E2=80=99s doing what you don=E2=80=99t do. Pr=
ocess often gets in the way of that.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09All the best practices of lean/agile innovation are true now=E2=80=94and=
 much more important than before.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09COV=
ID-19 has been an awaking for many organizations.=20

=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=E2=80=9CBusiness not as usual=E2=80=9D means new pain point=
s and new opportunities.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09How to de-ri=
sk innovation. What is the human capital agenda?

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Unfortunately in automotive, it=E2=80=99s hard to capture futur=
e optimism at this moment.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09I think th=
e concept of blue oceans is durable for decades to come. It makes me realiz=
e that execution requires courage.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09If=
 ever there was a time for humanity, this is it.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09Blue ocean thinking has a time and place. It=E2=80=99s not alwa=
ys conducive to actually getting innovation out the door in a timely manner=
. Moreover, if executive leadership is going to buy into this way of workin=
g, they need to have the courage and appropriate resources to execute.
=

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09What is the one thing we should stop to=
 drop our cost structure?

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Now it=
=E2=80=99s about not =E2=80=9Cboiling the ocean=E2=80=9D too quickly.

=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Non-disruptive creations=E2=80=94I like th=
e word choice.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Value innovation is un=
derstanding what people will pay for, and we see many of the value-creating=
 attributes that drove disruptors like Airbnb might migrate back to those w=
ho were disrupted (e.g., traditional hotels).

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09Make your core businesses better and aggressively capture value fr=
om new opportunities.

=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Emphasis on val=
ue creation aspect of innovation. Stimulated thinking on coordination to br=
ing in different voices and extract customer value.

<ul>
=09<li>Trust is very much at =
play here through this crisis. I=E2=80=99ve got a strong feeling that both =
politicians and corporations will be judged after this period as to how the=
y behaved, whether they were truthful, and if they did what they said they =
would.&nbsp;</li>
=09<li>The three guests sent the message of common sens=
e and doing the right things. Going back to these is so important during th=
is crisis.&nbsp;</li>
=09<li>Search for the simple offering through the u=
nderstanding of the complexity we are in.</li>
=09<li>How to continue the=
 journey we are on=E2=80=94driving more accountability and agility when we =
aren=E2=80=99t in crisis mode. As we do this, it really does unleash human =
potential. Also, not getting ahead of ourselves to predict the future, but =
double down on learning in spaces we know will emerge.</li>
=09<li>The wo=
rld focuses on zero-sum games; we should not think about this and instead f=
ocus on what we would want to be. Whether it=E2=80=99s Ren=C3=A9e, Hubert o=
r Walter, it seems that they all believed there was a value in imagining th=
e future we want to build.</li>
=09<li>I=E2=80=99m super encouraged by th=
e overall view that there is true opportunity here=E2=80=94politically, eco=
nomically, and especially in our businesses=E2=80=94and that we have techni=
ques for achieving that.</li>
=09<li>Good reminder of the value of these =
connections. Lots of good ideas, but also lots of good reminders (keep it s=
imple, unlock the power in humans, etc.).&nbsp;</li>
=09<li>Businesses wi=
ll be judged on how they behave.</li>
=09<li>I will take back that our po=
sitive mindset will need to continuously evolve to build a better world.</l=
i>
=09<li>The importance of collaboration, humility and vulnerability as =
leadership traits (rather than the =E2=80=9Csuperhero=E2=80=9D of old).</li=
>
=09<li>It=E2=80=99s an opportunity to reset and set the stage for the n=
ext 10 years.</li>
=09<li>Some common themes around trust, facts, collabo=
ration, simplicity and leading with a sense of purpose. Doing what=E2=80=
=99s right.</li>

<ul>
=09<l=
i><strong>The ultimate intersection ::&nbsp;</strong>What common thread run=
s through the many geniuses Isaacson has studied? They=E2=80=99re all imagi=
native, creative and innovative=E2=80=94and multidisciplinary. =E2=80=9CThe=
y all stood at the intersection of the arts and sciences,=E2=80=9D he said,=
 and they could see patterns across different disciplines. Steve Jobs would=
 say that creativity occurs when you stand at the intersection of art and t=
echnology. The other key trait they have in common? They had a =E2=80=9Cwil=
d curiosity for its own sake.=E2=80=9D They were all passionately inquisiti=
ve about anything and everything; they had =E2=80=9Cthe driven curiosity to=
 stop and observe things.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Simplicity in desi=
gn ::&nbsp;</strong>While most people think of design as a surface attribut=
e, da Vinci and Jobs knew that =E2=80=9Cthe essence of great design meant y=
ou had to go below the surface.=E2=80=9D They believed that =E2=80=9Csimpli=
city is the ultimate sophistication.=E2=80=9D Thus, to achieve simplicity a=
nd beautiful design, you must fully understand the complexity beneath it. D=
a Vinci studied the complex inner workings of the human body in order to pa=
int the beautiful, seemingly simple smile of<em>&nbsp;Mona Lisa</em>. Jobs =
iterated over and over again in order to achieve the intuitive, sleek desig=
n of the iPhone</li>
=09<li><strong>The physical and the digital ::&nbsp;=
</strong>The pandemic launched a massive experiment in remote work, and exe=
cutives are now charged with leading their organizations=E2=80=99 reopening=
 plans. Isaacson noted that Jobs was fanatical about creating opportunities=
 for people to meet in real life. Apple headquarters=E2=80=99 unique ring s=
hape was designed to create moments for employees to meet spontaneously. He=
 believed that bumping into each other would serendipitously spark new idea=
s. In the post-COVID-19 world, we=E2=80=99ll have to figure out how to bala=
nce physical and digital experiences to get the best from both.</li>
=09<=
li><strong>A source of optimism ::&nbsp;</strong>While every issue is immed=
iately polarized even amid a global crisis, Isaacson shared what gives him =
optimism for the future: Gen Z, whom he believes might be better called the=
 Corona Generation. His students have been very engaged in helping the comm=
unity around them. COVID-19 is shaping this generation. =E2=80=9CThey=
=E2=80=99re feeling that they=E2=80=99re all in this together as a new gene=
ration.=E2=80=9D He=E2=80=99s hopeful that in the future, when facing anoth=
er major crisis, =E2=80=9Cthat they will be less bitter and partisan and di=
visive than we are when they attack and approach social and civic issues.=
=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>The question you should ask ::</strong>&nbs=
p;Isaacson reflected on the recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane=
 Katrina. =E2=80=9CAt a certain point, we said, =E2=80=98The question is no=
t: How do we rebuild the city we had? But the question is: How do we build =
the city we want to have?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D He encouraged members to apply =
this to their own companies and ask, =E2=80=9CHow are we going not just to =
restore our company but build our company new in a different way and use th=
is crisis as an opportunity?=E2=80=9D</li>

<ul>
=09<li><strong>Leading in the current crisis ::&nbsp;</strong>=
The pandemic has been a major global shock, and companies will be impacted =
differently by industry and geography. =E2=80=9CThis is an invitation for a=
ll of us to have our finest hour,=E2=80=9D said Joly. Supply chains will li=
kely be reconfigured, and the era of unlimited globalization has ended. The=
 relationships between business, governments and society will evolve. Many =
companies won=E2=80=99t just have to restart; they=E2=80=99ll have to reset=
. The world is moving into a new era, =E2=80=9Cbut nobody has a script.=
=E2=80=9D Leaders must use resilience and agility to prepare for and naviga=
te this new normal.</li>
=09<li><strong>Purpose and humanity ::&nbsp;</st=
rong>Many of the principles Joly relied on while leading Best Buy=E2=80=
=99s turnaround are applicable for executives steering their organizations =
through the COVID-19 crisis. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s the idea of putting peop=
le and customers first, and treating profit as an outcome as opposed to the=
 main goal.=E2=80=9D Navigating an organization through crisis requires lea=
ding with both purpose and humanity. When leaders use purpose as a lens, th=
ey move from dangerous zero-sum games and begin to see new possibilities an=
d opportunities for growth. He recommended the book&nbsp;<a href=3D"https:/=

=E2=80=9Cirrational performance=E2=80=9D in uncertain times.</li>
=09<li>=
<strong>Unleashing human magic ::</strong>&nbsp;As a leader, he said, =
=E2=80=9CDefining what to do is usually relatively easy, defining how to do=
 it is a bit harder, and it=E2=80=99s doing it that=E2=80=99s the hard part=
.=E2=80=9D To effectively do what must be done, you must mobilize your orga=
nization by focusing on =E2=80=9Cunleashing human magic=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94helping connect what drives the individuals within your company with the=
 organization=E2=80=99s purpose. Focus on building authentic human connecti=
ons, creating a growth environment and pushing decision-making down in the =
organization as much as possible.</li>
=09<li><strong>The questions you s=
hould ask ::&nbsp;</strong>Joly shared with members three questions they sh=
ould ask themselves, their teams and their organizations during this crisis=
.
=09<ul>
=09=09<li><strong>How are you taking care of yourself?&nbsp;<=
/strong>This crisis requires you to be the best leader you can be. Are you =
spending enough time thinking about how you want to lead and how you want t=
o be remembered? Are you taking care of yourself physically, mentally and s=
piritually?&nbsp;</li>
=09=09<li><strong>How are your team members taking=
 care of themselves?&nbsp;</strong>Joly encouraged members to ask the above=
 questions to each person on their teams. =E2=80=9CWe all need to get to kn=
ow the people around us on a much deeper level than we ever have.=E2=80=
=9D</li>
=09=09<li><strong>What changes are impacting us?&nbsp;</strong>O=
n the business and strategy level, he said, =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s make sur=

and what it means to do something about this.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
=09<li><strong>Link technology to value ::&n=
bsp;</strong>Mauborgne argued that there=E2=80=99s a remarkable confusion b=
etween technological innovation and value innovation. =E2=80=9CTechnology i=
nnovation doesn=E2=80=99t create new markets; it only creates new markets w=
hen it=E2=80=99s applied to the value consumers use.=E2=80=9D Technology of=
ten gets pushed first without considering if it=E2=80=99s strategically pri=
ced for the market, if it=E2=80=99s simple and easy to use, or if it improv=
es users=E2=80=99 lives. =E2=80=9CHow do you link technology to value? The =
companies that create blue oceans always start with the value to the market=
 and work backward from there.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Six ways to r=
econstruct markets ::&nbsp;</strong>Companies tend to innovate in the same =
way as their competitors because they benchmark against each other. As an a=
lternative, Mauborgne shared six ways to reshape market boundaries and appl=
y blue-ocean thinking.&nbsp;
=09<ul>
=09=09<li><strong>Across industrie=
s:&nbsp;</strong>Look across alternative industries instead of at the compe=
tition within your own industry.&nbsp;</li>
=09=09<li><strong>Across stra=
tegic groups:&nbsp;</strong>Look across strategic groups. =E2=80=9CInstead =
of focusing on a strategic group within an industry, why do people trade up=
 and down between two strategic groups?=E2=80=9D</li>
=09=09<li><strong>B=
uyer group:&nbsp;</strong>What value would you see if you switched the buye=
r group?</li>
=09=09<li><strong>Complementary products and services:</str=
ong>&nbsp;=E2=80=9CWe tend to focus on only one product or service.=
=E2=80=9D Where are there complementary products and services?</li>
=09=
=09<li><strong>Functional and emotional:&nbsp;</strong>Can you take a funct=
ional product and make it emotional, or vice versa? Can you switch those tw=
o within an industry?</li>
=09=09<li><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>Can you =
understand the irreversible trends in your industry, seeing analogous indus=
tries that have gone through those trends, and then identify how you can ch=
ange value today to meet that trend as it develops.</li>
=09</ul>
=09</=
li>
=09<li><strong>Who isn=E2=80=99t your customer? ::&nbsp;</strong>Maub=
orgne emphasized the idea that blue-ocean strategy isn=E2=80=99t about talk=
ing more with your customer; it=E2=80=99s about connecting with the people =
