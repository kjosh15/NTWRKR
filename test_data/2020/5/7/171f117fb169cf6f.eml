Hey Josh,

I just texted you the password for the updated return.

You have a federal overpayment of $4,243, of which $3,440 will be applied
to the 1st quarter estimate and $537 will be refunded to you.  You'll
notice the math doesn't quite work on that and that is because there was a
$266 penalty for the estimated tax (what we are trying to avoid going
forward).

You have a state overpayment of $9,159, of which $1,110 will be applied to
the 1st quarter estimate and $8,049 will be refunded to you.  There was a
$45 penalty for the estimated tax (what we are trying to avoid going
forward).

You have a NYC overpayment of $10,000 which will all be refunded to you.

You'll see the estimated taxes are due in July (this year), September and
January.  So mark your calendar for those dates and if you are having a
decent year, pay the estimates, if you are not doing well, reach out to me
and we'll see if it's necessary.

I'll still need the efile authorizations signed and back from you in order
to submit your return (pages 8, 27 & 45).

Let me know if you have any questions.
