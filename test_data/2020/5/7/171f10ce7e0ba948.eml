Hi Josh- I'm not sure if this type of mask offers any advantages per se.
The 3d printable masks I've seen were a stopgap measure enabling people to
manufacture their own masks when none are commercially available, so this
particular flavor is new to me.

I don't know anything about masks and I'm unsure of the exact context of
your question, but I'll give you some guesses!

My layman's view of mask quality boils all the way down to "does all of the
air pass through filter media?". The answer has to be yes for the mask to
be at maximum efficacy, right? All incoming air has to be filtered, and
ideally the exhausted air will be filtered as well, if you're interested in
maximum protection for others. If a person is only worried about
themselves, only incoming air has to be filtered.

I suppose one could argue that a perfectly-fitted mask provides the best
seal, ensuring that all incoming air is conveyed in a predicable manner and
can be reliably passed through filter media. A mask with gaps would perhaps
mix air that comes through the filter and untreated air that comes in
through gaps, especially if the gap provides less resistance than the
filter media.

But really, I don't know. The medical industry seems to be pretty content
with the square or slightly fitted disposable mask, which should tell us
something. But the concept of disposal is also baked into the medical
industry, in part to avoid problems with improper maintenance or
sanitization procedures when dealing with reusable equipment.

I have seen people wearing yellow dishwashing gloves, usually FILTHY ones.
They understand the concept of a barrier between their body and everyday
objects, but seem to not understand the idea that residues from the items
they touch remain on their awful gloves, waiting to be rubbed onto their
noses or the corners of their eyes. Point being, a durable mask like this
would need to be sanitized regularly.

You'd have to talk to someone else about issues related to moisture inside
a sealed mask, condensation from breath, etc. It's unlikely that whoever
designed this has truly had the time or wherewithal to test and address
issues.

Probably not super helpful, just a collection of thoughts.

-Steve
