Congrats!! Have only looked over it once, but quick first impressions are:

- Big, bold vision; very compelling and timely
- I wanted clearer divisions of content in the deck; i.e., "This is the
problem." "This is a solution." "This is why it's profitable."
- Probably want to dress up my bio to include senior exec consulting,
technology strategy, and advisory positions - or am I missing the mark?

Nicely done,
Josh
