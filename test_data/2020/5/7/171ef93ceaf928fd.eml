Hi Josh,

First of all, I hope you and your close ones have been safe during the last
month.

I=E2=80=99m emailing a bit out of the blue, because I wrote a book, and it =
seemed
like a good excuse to send a note to people in my address book in order to
reconnect, pass along some good wishes and share a link to my first book.
It=E2=80=99s called The Acorn Method, and it includes the philosophy and ta=
ctics
that we have developed over the years building BARK (BarkBox) and helping
founders and large companies with their venture building efforts at prehype=
.

The book is officially launching this week, and my publisher has agreed to
discount the Kindle version for the first two weeks so that I can share it
with friends and business contacts. I=E2=80=99d love to offer you a discoun=
ted copy
and hear what you think. You can get it on Amazon via this link
<https://geni.us/AcornMethod?is=3D5e9dcb16582d7109ce98a605>. I am hoping th=
at
you might be intrigued enough to give it a read and maybe even leave a
review. Reviews are one of the most important factors in how many new
readers the book is able to reach, and each one makes a real difference!

If nothing else, see this a friendly "hi" - and hope that all is well with
you, your family and business.

Feel free to reply back to reconnect, talk about BARK and dogs, or prehype.
We have finally updated the prehype website (*prehype.com*
<http://prehype.com/?is=3D5e9dcb16582d7109ce98a605>), so you can read more
about our various startups and activities ranging from our new Institute of
Applied Entrepreneurship to our entrepreneur network and our incubation and
co-creation efforts.

With that, good vibes,

Henrik
