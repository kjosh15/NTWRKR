No doubt -- craziest month ever

Things are good with me -- officially a McKinsey Senior Advisor -- spending
8-10 hours a week with them for the last few and also investing in startups
-- have a portfolio of 7 so far (built over the last few years) -- not sure
what I want to do going forward -- how much I want to push, etc.  My
opinion changes almost per hour so still letting it simmer.

Hope you are well and hanging together through the boredom.

The quantified self stuff is still gnawing at me -- gotta be something to
be done there but still not sure what....

What are you up to these days?

Stay in touch and hopefully chat more soon,

Bill
