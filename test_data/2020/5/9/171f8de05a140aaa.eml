Thanks for the input.

I can only imagine how busy that makes you.

Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar has just applied for support to get a student wor=
king on a
research to find out what is out there. If we get that support she will
work for us on this subject for 3 months and that would be the first step
in looking at existing platforms as well as existing content.

I am going to take a bit more time to do the pilot and maybe stop
connecting it to C19 as it would have to relate into a future demand.

Would love to bounce of you two as we get further into this and get you
involved in a startup if you feel this is something to take further when we
have proper research done. My thoughts are then to look at the funding
system for start ups in Iceland and possibly get the founder of Mussila ,
Margr=C3=A9t J=C3=BAl=C3=ADana Sigur=C3=B0ard=C3=B3ttir,  involved as well =
as she has successfully
gone through it all and is involved in edutainment for children.

xahh

 We have been looking at different ways of moving forward with Tungum=C3=A1=

l. We would start by developing this for Icelandic children living abroad a=
nd if that works well we could possibly develop a tool for different nation=
