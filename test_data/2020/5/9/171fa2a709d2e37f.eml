Has anyone had experience signing an equity agreement with a start-up?

If so, any advice or pointers for things to watch for?

Hey ITPeeps,

Any one have any recommendations for virtual merchandising software? Some
features I'm looking for (need not include all):

   - Ability to take a product photo and transform it to be various other
   product colors
   - Ability to mockup merchandise displayed in a 3D store setting
   - Ability to share digital assets across multiple stores

I'll be doing my own research, but if any one has any personal
recommendations, I'd appreciate it!

Alex

I'd encourage you to speak with a lawyer before signing anything, especially if this is your first time diving into equity compensation. You can usually get something reviewed and explained for a couple hundred bucks and NYU might have some resources through Stern or the Entrepreneurial Institute. I know it's not cheap, but if you are going to be dedicating a portion of your life to a company that is dangling equity in front of you (particularly if it's most or all of your compensation), you need to make sure you know what you're getting into.

There are vesting schedules, "cliffs," and dilution considerations along with tax implications that you need to understand. Also, in a funding event and depending on your role, vesting schedules can often be recalculated or partially reset, so that needs to be factored into your decision making (and your calculations of how rich you will become.)

Remember that most equity ends up being worthless and if it turns into something valuable, it's usually after many years. Too often, equity is a trap that's used to get smart, honest, and optimistic people to move mountains for little to no reward, so make sure you are in a position to take care of yourself before you consider embarking on the journey.

Best,

Y

And sometimes (rarely but sometimes), you end up with enough to put a down
payment on a home. Don't bank on it though. Always get a mix of cash and
equity. Equity is a perk, not a complete substitute for payment.

But yeah - if you don't trust the people you're working with enough to ask
them about the vesting schedule and other terms, you might want to
reconsider. And - getting a lawyer to explain a complicated contract (and
perhaps help you negotiate) is never a bad idea.

In typical standard equity agreements (where it?s apart of additional
compensation) these tend to be consistent for full-time employment:

- you?re granted options. This is important to understand because you need
to purchase your equity
- you will have a vesting schedule. This normally means the total grant
will be given to you over a period of time. Typical split is 25% of total
grant given per year. But remember it?s the portion of which you?re granted
the option to purchase
- the ?cliff? - this is the one year (or other date)
which marks the first wave of options (25% for example) is given to you
- taxes. This for sure you should get a professional for if you?re
considering
- if you part ways with the company before your Cliff, you don?t have a
right to your share of what was vested to you
- if you part ways with the company and you do have a vested portion - if
you a period of time in which you need to exercise your option (aka
purchase them out of pocket)
- things that happen behind the scenes that you will rarely get access to:

A) cap table - this is basically a table of who else are bought in owners
of the startup. Employee equity is normally part of a pool (eg 2-8%) which
is what they incentivize potential employees with
B) 409a - this is the fair market valuation of the startup that was used to
price your option grant

Again this is what I?ve experienced as standard,, but all companies are
different on stage. There?s tons of material on this online / Reddit which
You can go down a rabbit hole on

Hey everybody!

I hope you are all staying safe and healthy during these trying times.

I wanted to share my latest art project with y?all.

Quarantine Connections, my collaboration with Scott Kildall and Chris Butzen, responds to the emotional isolation we feel during the COVID-19 pandemic, by facilitating hand-crafted letters that bring distant strangers together. It invites us to physically connect, without touch.

The project was beta-testing last week, and soft launched yesterday. We use Facebook for ?real person? authentication, but keep all information other than what is necessary for one-way letter exchanges private. All you have to do is sign up here and give it a try: https://quarantineconnections.org/ <https://quarantineconnections.org/>
And as part of our fast launch and ongoing improvement, we would love your feedback (we?ve made a lot of changes already)... Any bugs or issues? Suggestions? Praise or criticism? Submit that here: https://quarantineconnections.org/contact/ <https://quarantineconnections.org/contact/>
MORE DETAILS:
Quarantine Connections matches real people seeking physical connection across the country (currently US only, just because of postal costs?). You can write on a postcard, stationary, or paper, include recipes, photos, or clippings. Send anything paperbound, in one envelope, and with one stamp.

You can ask for a letter for yourself or anyone else, as long as you participate by sending out your own envelope to another quarantined community-member. Everyone pays it forward. Be seen and feel connected, and provide the same for someone else, with no further obligation from any party involved.

Quarantine Connections uses the intimacy of individually crafted letters ? and receiving hand-delivered mail in your own safe space ? to establish empathy across isolated people.

The Quarantine Connections project team is Scott Kildall, Nathaniel Stern and Chris Butzen. More information about us at https://quarantineconnections.org/about-the-artists/ <https://quarantineconnections.org/about-the-artists/>
