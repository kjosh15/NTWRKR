hanks for getting back to us.<br><br><br>So I took a look at the page again=
 and compared on my end and this is how it looks: <a href=3D"http://somup.c=
om/cYhqIUjaH0" target=3D"_blank">http://somup.com/cYhqIUjaH0</a><br><br>I&#=
39;m not exactly sure which is the correct layout and which is the wrong on=
e. But from your previous message you mentioned this &quot;<em><strong>here=
 is a &quot;Home&quot; title at the top of the page, and the formatting for=
 the rest of the site is also all off.</strong></em> &quot;, so to help us =
understand this issue better can you give us more descriptive details of ho=
w it was before? <br><br>Upon checking the page I noticed that this youtube=
 video seems to be added using a third-party plugin, please am I right?<br>=
<br>Also, is this the same layout you see when you are on the backend edito=
r or this layout issue only happens when on the live page?<br><br><br>If yo=
u are a pro user, could you please send us the email you have used in purch=
asing your Pro license and your WordPress login details so we can directly =
access your site and check this further?<br><br><br>I will be looking forwa=
rd to hearing from you.<br>Stay safe</div><br>

hanks for getting back to us.<br><br><br>I&#39;m sorry to hear you are havi=
ng these inconveniences.<br><br>From what I understand turning off the Slid=
er Revolution plugins seems to have resolved the issue with the video but t=
he website layout doesn&#39;t look, right?<br><br>May I ask, did you try en=
abling the slider revolution again to see if it changes anything about the =
layout of the page? Since the slider revolution is part of the theme as you=
 mentioned earlier, deactivating it could possibly be the reason why the la=
yout doesn&#39;t look right.<br><br>Could you please send us a screenshot o=
r screencast of how the page currently looks on your end so we can compare =
it with what we see on our end and, as I wasn&#39;t able to see any visible=
 issue when I check the home page <a href=3D"http://www.h4xindustries.com/"=
 target=3D"_blank">http://www.h4xindustries.com/</a> and the page you initi=
ally sent <a href=3D"http://www.h4xindustries.com/MANI/" target=3D"_blank">=
http://www.h4xindustries.com/MANI/</a>?<br><br>I will also suggest that you=
 try reporting this issue to the support of the slider revolution plugin so=
 they can check this as well from their end and take a closer at the issue =
with the video as well.<br><br><br>Thanks for your patience. I will be look=
ing forward to hearing from you.<br>Stay safe<br></div><br>

                    <div>
                        <div style=3D"font-family:Arial,&quot;Helvetica Neu=
e&quot;,Helvetica,Tahoma,sans-serif;color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:13px;line=
-height:19px;margin:0px">
                                                        <div>I followed you=
r instructions with the following results:<br>
<br>
1. deactivate all of your plugins except for Elementor<br>
<br>
Deactivating ALL plugins (including Elementor) caused the weird YouTube vid=
eo to disappear. (It also made the site look like ass, as you&#39;d expect.=
) Turning the Elementor plugin back on did not cause it to reappear.<br>
<br>
2. switch your theme temporarily to a default WordPress theme like twenty-n=
ineteen<br>
<br>
Switching to twenty-nineteen theme did not cause it to reappear.<br>
<br>
3. see if the Youtube video issue still happens.<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
4. If not, you can activate your theme again to test, then<br>
<br>
Reactivated the Bifrost theme and the video did not reappear.<br>
<br>
5. activate your plugins one by one so we can find the culprit.<br>
<br>
Activating the Slider Revolution plugin caused the video to return. Also, t=
he website as a whole no longer looks correct - there is a &quot;Home&quot;=
 title at the top of the page, and the formatting for the rest of the site =
is also all off. The Slider Revolution plugin was part of the theme, IIR.<b=

<br>
Please advise.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<br>
One other question, however: at the bottom of the page at <a href=3D"http:/=
/www.h4xindustries.com/MANI/" target=3D"_blank">http://www.h4xindustries.co=
m/MANI/</a> a YouTube video appears. Often, it multipllies the more you int=
eract with the page. How can I get rid of it? I&#39;ve tried duplicating th=
e page and deleting each section until nothing exists except for the menu f=
ramework (a template) and it still appears. I&#39;ve also looked at the men=
u template and can&#39;t find any sign of it. Help?<br>
<br>
Thanks much,<br>
Josh<br>
