Think we'll see this to a lesser degree in the EU... and to a higher degree
elsewhere (S. America, Africa, etc.) I.e., a spike in inequality.

Occurs to me if Iceland paid a standard wage you could establish a brand as
innovative, great companies to work for - in a way that could produce a
hedge in hiring top talent.

Also, been talking to a head of IDEO (who is also moving to Iceland) about
building a design school. Might fit nicely into this narrative. Interested?
