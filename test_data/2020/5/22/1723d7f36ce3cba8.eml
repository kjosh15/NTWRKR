Thought it might be helpful to bone up on single-sign on as we're going to
need it sooner rather than later for large corporate clients:

https://gravitational.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/

As with everything else in the world there are plenty of toolkits, like
this one:

https://developers.onelogin.com/saml

I don't know what's most highly recommended, but can ask around when we get
to that point. Another, possibly more salient consideration is what AWS
supports:

https://aws.amazon.com/identity/saml/

I.e., you just turn it on. Probably our best option. :)

P.S. Looks like AWS's Cloudwatch service integrates directly with Splunk
also:
