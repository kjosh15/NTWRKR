Karl,

Long time no speak - not since Margaret introduced us in 2011! I'm taking
the pandemic as a prompt to reconnect with all the interesting people I've
lost touch with over the years; let me know if you have a moment to catch
up and compare notes! No agenda, although as usual I have a variety of
business interests that may/may not be useful - just looking to reach out
and see how I can help.

All best,
Josh
