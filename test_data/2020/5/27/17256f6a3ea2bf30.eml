Hey 'gents!

I'm heading to Iceland next week and have a ton of contacts in the TV/Film
business there (some good friends helped set up Game of Thrones for all
their shoots in country). Iceland offers generous tax breaks, has the
lowest rate of Covid infection in Europe, and is keen to bring in business.
If I can help facilitate anything, let me know - I'd love to be a part of
something there!

All best wishes,
Josh
