My brief bio summarizes the work I've done followed by some selected =
projects that are unusual or are directly transferable experience. I'm =
working up a more detailed outline on how to put this system together.

I am a technologist and entrepreneur with extensive experience from the =
seed of a startup idea to exit. Over the years I have had the privilege =
of working with talented people in areas including deep learning, =
computer security, and mesh networking. As co-founder and CEO I led =
Vertex.AI and negotiated its sale to Intel. As a consultant I have =
prototyped, shipped, rescued, and advised on a broad range of software =
efforts. Other roles include Principal Software Engineer at the Pioneer =
Square Labs venture studio, Manager for Security, Wireless and Advanced =
Technologies / Special Assistant to the CEO at Unium Technologies =
(acquired by Nokia), Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead for Security =
at IMVU, Technical Program Manager at Intel, and Security Analyst at =
Microsoft.

IMVU: When I was there IMVU's primary product was a consumer 3D chat =
product. I was tech lead for security and worked in the CASH =
monetization group. In CASH we did extensive work on behavioral data =
collection, third party integrations, user onboarding, etc, in a =
always-on production environment. There are many lessons out of that =
work in terms of how to run an operationally complex service with =
external dependencies including payment processors.

BTLE indoor location system: For an undisclosed client I built the =
software back end for a realtime indoor location service. The system was =
used to track people second-to-second and provide paging services at =
large events. The system used Bluetooth beacons and radio triangulation =
with a special antenna array, and the technical problems and sheer =
volume of data yield some transferrable lessons for a contact tracing =
system. There are organizational lessons out of this on how to integrate =
different functions (hardware, RF, software, client), manage personal =
privacy, etc.

PSL: While at PSL I got to look into some of the portfolio companies for =
lessons learned. Two in particular are interesting: Attunely is a =
machine learning system for driving efficiency in debt collection. They =
have really tricky PII and regulatory issues that they've solved to get =
in the market. SigmaIQ makes an automated accounting (account =
reconciliation) product. Lessons learned there inform 3rd party data =
integration & challenges applying ML to transaction data.

Finally, Vertex.AI: There I built the team that built a foundational =
piece of deep learning infrastructure, led operations and technology =
development, and ultimately sold it into Intel where today it is core to =
their ML/AI software stack. Through that I gained practial understanding =
of the whole stack from customer data down to chip design. It also built =
a network from which I can recruit for any of those specialties.
