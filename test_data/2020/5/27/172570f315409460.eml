The more I read about the way AWS is set up the more comfortable I feel
with setting up a VM. They have plenty of security group permissioning
capabilities, such that we can limit access from a particular client to
only connect from predesignated IPs, etc. Their log monitoring platform
seems pretty comprehensive. And their at-rest encryption should address any
data storage concerns (as Misha said.)

In other words, I think that if we move solely to a VM instance, use best
practices for permissioning, and put some good log monitoring in place I'm
not certain we'll need a SIDS HIDS or NIDS. Moreover, if we move the client
instance to LAMBDA instead of a hosted solution we may be able to avoid
ongoing patching regimes as well.

Food for thought,
Josh
