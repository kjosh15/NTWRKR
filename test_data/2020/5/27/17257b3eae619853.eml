Great insights, Brad. I would also add that often, real change happens not
at the center of gravity, where people are too vested in the status quo so
they protect turf, reinforce ivory towers, capitalize on core competencies,
institutionalize and freeze so called 'state-of-the-art,'  and too often
ignore disruptive change until change has already happened elsewhere. IBM
-> Apple, Disney -> Pixar, Walmart -> Amazon, GM -> Tesla, the list goes on
and on.

Real change comes so often from the edges of a vast ocean. Where things
that used to swim must now learn to walk and breathe air. Where the froth
washes and intermixes with new things, or catches in a tide pool and begins
to develop its own eco system. When the edge of ideas cross-pollinate,
that's the spark for new ideas and innovations.

I think the big companies and big government departments will try to return
to business as usual. But the tide pools have already been formed from the
tsunami. Change is already underway, even if the ocean doesn't care or know
about it. And things that used to only swim, are now beginning to walk and
run in new ways and under new rules.

tlast this crisis and find a way to return to its familiar way of working b=
ut that the taste of something different will open the eyes of a portion of=
 its workforce and that retention will be even worse than usual for the nex=
t year or so.</div><div><br></div><div>As for working securely in a remote =
manner, I think the financial sector has shown this is possible for awhile =
now. Financial planners and wealth advisors work from the road and have acc=
ess to tens/hundreds of millions of dollars of portfolio net worth. Traders=
 and quants often work remote and the deals and infrastructure they have ac=
cess to are valued in the billions. What the intel community has not had to=
 confront yet is a sustained challenge to its accustomed ways of working (t=
hough the extended field deployments of the War on Terror came closer than =
anything) so it is blind to the cost of its current methods. The entertainm=
ent industry is in the midst of this revolution in distributed working (how=
 many games wouldn&#39;t get made if you couldn&#39;t outsource to Ukraine =
or Poland for development &amp; art, how many animated series only came to =
be because of cheap artistic talent in East Asia, etc..) and companies that=
 can&#39;t keep up will be beat by others (early example was Pixar essentia=
lly taking over Disney Animation). Entertainment companies will find a way =
to push projects forward with a distributed model whilst still avoiding lea=
ks/spoilers or they will fall behind others who can. The history major part=
 of me is looking forward to reading the books that will be written about h=
ow 2020 was an inflection point for many industries that caused widespread =
disruption and spurred rapid innovation--and was ultimately one of the cont=
ributors to the leading companies of the future that we haven&#39;t even he=
ard of yet.</div><div><br></div><div>Brad<br>SHARP &#39;08</div></div><br><=
