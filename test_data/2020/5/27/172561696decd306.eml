I did a little review and it looks like Metasploit is still industry
standard. If you can set up an AWS sandbox I'm happy to build a light
framework for running automated tests so we can issue a quarterly report.
Alternately, let me know when a good time to potentially knock over our
existing sandbox might be (and make sure Liquid has backups!)

In the meantime, send me that testing framework you're using and I'll build
a lightweight automated testing protocol for that as well.
