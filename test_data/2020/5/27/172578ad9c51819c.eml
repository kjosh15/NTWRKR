When I was in the first year of my time as an analyst at DIA, I was
selected to be part of the overnight team for DIA's participation in a
Pacific Command military exercise. Lots of downtime as we waited for
something to happen. One of the bright, young China analysts explained to
me how he was five times better informed about what was going on in China
when he was at home vice in the SCIF at work. It spanned several factors:
- Technology (he had high-end computers with multiple wrap-around monitors
at his home desk, a government-issue lowest-bid PC with one monitor at work=
)
- Access (at home he had a hacker community-maintained VPN he used to get
around the Great Chinese Firewall to view sites as if he was in China;
while at work he had a feeble out-of-date VPN that even his supervisors
thought was already compromised)
- Software (home setup included open source and purchased programs for
monitoring social media, visualizing data, doing rapid translations, etc..
while work had a few government licenses of aging software and multi-day
turnaround times for translation)
- Crowd-sourcing (at home he was tied into a network of China watchers &
experts that spanned the globe while at work it was him and a handful of
other analysts in his office plus some at other agencies--though he was
discouraged from working with certain agencies...)

He was highly regarded by his leadership and being groomed for promotion
but confided in me that he expected he'd leave government service in the
next few years as he'd concluded the thrill of access to classified
information didn't make up for how he felt his time was wasted during much
of the day and his fears that getting too comfortable in the government
analyst role would lead to him losing his edge and competitiveness for a
better-compensated analyst role in the financial sector. But it was the
quality of life challenges of the workplace that seemed to be driving him
to an earlier departure. He'd negotiated with his manager to have a later
start time (he was a night owl and stayed up late to have more overlap with
West Pacific time zones) but wasn't able to take full advantage of it
because the agency didn't have enough parking so he ended up spending 30+
minutes circling for an open spot. He thought the food in the building
sucked and felt very disconnected from his social network due to not being
able to access social media software during the workday (this was
pre-smartphones, though those would have been stashed in a locker). Still,
he had a high mission-focus and a strong sense of patriotic duty, and I
believe the agency could have retained him if he had been able to work from
home two days a week. Given the above, he probably would have been more
productive and able to provide more-informed analysis.

The tech company I am now made an early decision to go full-remote during
the pandemic, and has been able to make the transition fairly painlessly.
They haven't committed to full-remote as a permanent option yet, but they
are now considering it as a hiring option (was off the table before), which
will open up our talent recruiting pool. The CEO has noted that meetings
seem to work best if they are all-present or all-remote, but the mixed
format tends to make it difficult to fully include the subset of
participants who are remote. My biggest hangup about working from home
full-time has been the difficulty of setting boundaries with the family.
With the kids home from school and my wife working remote as well, we've
had a hard time finding ways to allow us both to be productive while not
just parking the boys in front of a screen. But I recognize that is more
related to the phase of life than a universal constraint.

My prediction is that the intel community will outlast this crisis and find
a way to return to its familiar way of working but that the taste of
something different will open the eyes of a portion of its workforce and
that retention will be even worse than usual for the next year or so.

As for working securely in a remote manner, I think the financial sector
has shown this is possible for awhile now. Financial planners and wealth
advisors work from the road and have access to tens/hundreds of millions of
dollars of portfolio net worth. Traders and quants often work remote and
the deals and infrastructure they have access to are valued in the
billions. What the intel community has not had to confront yet is a
sustained challenge to its accustomed ways of working (though the extended
field deployments of the War on Terror came closer than anything) so it is
blind to the cost of its current methods. The entertainment industry is in
the midst of this revolution in distributed working (how many games
wouldn't get made if you couldn't outsource to Ukraine or Poland for
development & art, how many animated series only came to be because of
cheap artistic talent in East Asia, etc..) and companies that can't keep up
will be beat by others (early example was Pixar essentially taking over
Disney Animation). Entertainment companies will find a way to push projects
forward with a distributed model whilst still avoiding leaks/spoilers or
they will fall behind others who can. The history major part of me is
looking forward to reading the books that will be written about how 2020
was an inflection point for many industries that caused widespread
disruption and spurred rapid innovation--and was ultimately one of the
contributors to the leading companies of the future that we haven't even
heard of yet.
