I'm heading over in a couple weeks; it turns out I'm good friends with a
bunch of folks in the TV/Film business over there, so if you need anything
facilitated let me know. Some of them set up Game of Thrones, and Iceland
is super keen to get more work in so are offering generous tax breaks and
the lowest rate of COVID-19 in the EU. Good times!

Let me know if we can set something up - otherwise let me know when you
have a moment to talk about pitching an international innovation series for
once we get a vaccine.

All best,
Josh
