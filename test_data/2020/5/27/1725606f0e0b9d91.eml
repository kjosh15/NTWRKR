Hi Josh! I am alive. I must=E2=80=99ve missed your email because I have had c=
ontractors in my house for two full months painting and redoing the bathroom=
s and my life is under a plastic tarp. I=E2=80=99ve started to dig my way ou=
t but I=E2=80=99m still living in the basement. To further complicate matter=
s, I had PRP treatment done on a torn tendon in my ankle and it has really l=
aid me up. That was last Friday. PRP is a very interesting alternative to su=
rgery but don=E2=80=99t let anyone tell you that it doesn=E2=80=99t hurt lik=
e hell! I=E2=80=99ve been taking drugs but I need to get a refill.

I have a friend who was writing code for something that sounds kind a like w=
hat you may be doing. Do you need an extra coder? He is a genius, I think a l=
ittle autistic, but a great guy. I think his company went belly up but I=E2=80=
=99m not sure. I hope you do better!

I haven=E2=80=99t worked since the beginning of March. My client replaced me=
 with a software engineer on a particular gig but it was really because she d=
idn=E2=80=99t want to be told the truth. There seems to be a lot of that goi=
ng around=E2=80=A6 I won=E2=80=99t work for people who don=E2=80=99t want to=
 know the truth. There=E2=80=99s another company that wants to pick me up in=
 July. It is a start up and I think a better fit for me. I formed an LLC and=
 work freelance but this guy won=E2=80=99t let me do that. As long as he mak=
es the money work, I don=E2=80=99t care. I just hate that whole concept of h=
aving to earn leave. I like to do what I want to do when I want to do it and=
 that doesn=E2=80=99t work for everyone!=20

I really have missed interacting with human beings. I am in and out of a fun=
k but I think that=E2=80=99s mostly because of the plastic tarp situation co=
mpounded by acute pain especially at night.=20

As for my opinion about top down democracy, well we saw that that worked pre=
tty well amongst certain people but there are so many holdouts. Take the sim=
ple act of wearing a mask for example. Some people view that as a violation o=
f their civil rights while others view it as their civic duty. How did we be=
come so polarized? Well I know the answer to that but don=E2=80=99t get me s=
tarted. This may be a very rude thing to say Josh but I think you better wai=
t for the next administration before =E2=80=9CThe right thing=E2=80=9C can e=
ver out ake hold. They=E2=80=99re too many lunatics there displaying anger f=
or anything that isn=E2=80=99t the white male model, And it seems to have sp=
illed over into their every day choices.

 It=E2=80=99s so good to hear from you.
Margaret
