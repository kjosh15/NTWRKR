I=E2=80=99m having the same problem, except that the servo doesn=E2=80=99t =
do anything
other than move 1 degree on startup. I=E2=80=99ve tested to servo, it works=
 fine.
I=E2=80=99ve used a multimeter and tested the power supply, and the voltage=
 is
5.2v, and amperage is around 2a. I have a power supply and I used it at the
same voltage and amperage as specified, and had the same problem.
