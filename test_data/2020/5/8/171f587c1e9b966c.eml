I filed for a PPP loan using my 2018 return as my 2019 return wasn=E2=80=99=
t done
yet; they required a 1040 for 2019, so I made my best estimate, filed, and
had it accepted for $18k.

30m later my accountant got my 2019 return filed and the 1040 came back
with slightly higher income listed.

The site I filed for my PPP via (Kabbage) is completely unresponsive to
either email or phone. It=E2=80=99s been almost a week since the notice of
acceptance.

Should I fill in the forms to accept the loan, knowing that there may be
questions later and that I might have been eligible for slightly more? Or
should I wait for an answer and risk losing the whole thing as federal
funding runs out and/or my application gets set back to square one?

Any advice would be appreciated!!

Much thanks,
Josh
