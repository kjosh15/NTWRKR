You were suggested as a good person to contact reg. clinical trials for
Continuous Glucose Monitors; I've been in discussion with Abbot and am
curious to talk to someone in the US who can help me understand what an
insurer might look for. Do you have time for a brief call in the next
couple weeks?

All best wishes,
Josh
