Really well done Summit, Mike. I was super curious to see how you'd handle
the transition to virtual and as usual your team really delivered. I've got
several notes, but one take-away was that I got lots of feedback from our
huddle group around their desire to understand best practices managing
remote work(ers). So it seems like doing a session on the topic fits a need=
!

Looking forward to speaking Tuesday,
Josh
