Se=C3=B1or Busqu=C3=A9,

Apologies for writing in email, but I didn't want to put off
contacting you any longer. Things in NYC are a bit hectic, as I'm sure
they are there in Spain! Please do let us know how you and yours are
doing.

We're all doing very well here, and the children are thriving as we've
paired with another family with two kids the same age. Altogether it's
much more maintainable, and so far none of have felt any real effects
of the illness. We also have the benefit of being able to go outside
for walks and runs, which makes a huge difference.

Again, we wish you and yours all the best and eagerly hope to hear
from you soon.

Sincerely,
Josh & Hulda
