Good chatting with you today - really curious to hear where you head in the
near future. Let me know if you want to schedule a followup call; I'll be
keeping my eyes open on the banking front in the meantime...

Also in the meanwhile, if you could introduce me to Matt (about clinical
trials for CGMs) and remind me about your brother's role I'd be much
obliged!

Take care and keep me posted,
Josh
