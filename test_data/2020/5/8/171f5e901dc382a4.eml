Josh,
Hope all is well - wanted to drop some additional info.
From what we understand one of the teams at Estee is seriously considering
vision as a tool for unique identity and track and trace. The tech they are
proposing is a PUF or Physically Unclonable Function. If you are not aware
of the approach - it is basically working on the premise that there are
natural imperfections in packaging and printing or for pretty much
everything. Some use diamond dust or manufacture imperfections into the
print or package to compensate for the required resolution to get to
multiple bit ID's. Take a picture of this thing at high res whether it's
diamond dust spread over a surface or just the natural imperfections in a
package and Wa-La... unique identifier.

Although these technologies are very interesting for brand protection and
detecting counterfeits, I do not believe this technology is developed to
the point it can be leveraged for track and trace, chain of custody or
consumer interaction. We use these technologies at times as well, but for
brand protection.  I might not have the full picture but from what I
understand there is interest from the EL team to use this tech as a true
unique identity technology for consumer interaction and track and trace.
From a practical standpoint I can't say I agree with that approach.

Obviously we feel RFID/NFC/even QR is a strong choice, but most importantly
I wanted to allow you the opportunity to research the PUF vision tech and
the provider prior to your call in case the subject comes up.
