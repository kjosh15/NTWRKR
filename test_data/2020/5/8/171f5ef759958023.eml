Interesting concept, however, further investigation showed this was either a=
 birthday or Easter celebration rather than a Coronavirus party.=20

Intriguing that it showed up in WW.=20

BTW, I looked - briefly - at Amazon Fresh (home delivery). They appear to de=
liver to WW but I don=E2=80=99t know if that includes 15 miles East of town a=
nd up in the mountains. Further, I looked at meats and they seemed to offer o=
nly super-prime choices. I.e., 4 steaks (8 oz each) for $79. I saw another o=
ffering for $149 (meat for 4 for A dinner). We get 4 choice 1 lb ribeyes at C=
ostco for about $34! ISI.l have to investigate further. I=E2=80=99m afraid m=
y first foray scared me off.=20

As we mentioned, Walmart=E2=80=99s order and pick up worked well, although I=
 don=E2=80=99t like their produce or meats. We visited the new =E2=80=9CButc=
her Butcher=E2=80=9D in town. Grass-fed meat, etc. In addition, some nice ch=
eeses and very friendly. They will put together a package of your choice and=
 if it=E2=80=99s over $50 you get 20% off. Prices aren=E2=80=99t cheap, so t=
his (>$50 purchase) is the way to go.  Very friendly people. Lastly, Ikm goi=
ng to have to look at the local farm that offers weekly boxes. Your mother w=
as put off, but the season has moved on AND they do allow substitutions in t=
he boxes.=20

Love,
DAD
