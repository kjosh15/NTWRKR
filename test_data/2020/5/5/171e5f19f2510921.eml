Went to check out your twitter account and found that it's been suspended.
Too much ranting, possibly?

Long time no speak!! The pandemic seems to be putting everyone back in
touch; let me know if you're game to catch up on the last decade (or two?)
in the next couple weeks. Also, I'm talking with Abbot's CMO about a large
scale study and it looks like Sage might be a good fit to do the dev.

Hope you and yours are doing well,
Josh
