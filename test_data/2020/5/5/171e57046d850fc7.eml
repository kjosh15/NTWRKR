Do we have any other case studies we can cite? My friend David at Peppercom
was pushing for them, and offered to give feedback on how and what we could
use as part of a larger media push, such as on LinkedIn.

Also, Peppercom has almost no cash but wants to try Indigo internally.
Small team (~50 people, I'm guessing?) but salespeople want to understand
it better before they go sell it. What thoughts for an onboarding fee + per
head cost?
