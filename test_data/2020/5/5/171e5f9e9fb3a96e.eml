Long time no speak!! If this pandemic is good for anything, it's putting us
all back in touch with the people we've admired but lost connection with.
Let me know if you have time for a brief call to catch up in the coming
weeks! No agenda, although I have a company with some interesting data sets
if that's your thing. Otherwise I hope you and yours are safe and well.

All best,
Josh
