Hi Josh,

I think that's a path we could look at using in the future, but we think
there's just enough tenants that would have trouble accessing the
website/app that we think the best path is going to be to hand out paper
forms. On a related note, however, I was wondering if you could put me in
touch with one of the JustFix folks or if you would like to talk to them
yourself. I found a few ways of getting more data about landlords/real
estate companies/management companies that they don't have on their
website. I've attached a link to a visual of I made mapping all of the
WhoOwnsWhat connections related to our building. I also added all other
connections I could find through publicly available data - things like who
actually owns all those LLC shell companies, and any court cases I could
find involving the companies/individuals. This actually happened to be a
goldmine because I found another individual who is taking Canvas to court
for refusing to make repairs, and I'm having a phone call with him on
Thursday. I understand if this isn't something JustFix is interested in,
though. Let me know if you're having trouble viewing it because it's a
website/software I haven't used before.

Thanks
