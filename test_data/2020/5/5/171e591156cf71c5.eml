Hello, ITP! Hope you are all safe and well during this historically nutty
time.

I am reaching out rn with a favor to ask. For the last several months, I
have been running product at Reese Witherspoon?s Hello Sunshine-- our
mission is to transform the narrative for what it means to be a woman (!)--
it is awesome!!

We are looking for a product design and engineering shop to help us build
our beta, and I thought you fine folks might know of someone or be the
people we need! The elements of our product, that we are interested to find
a team with expertise in include: Social, Paid Subscription, 3PL (shipping
physical goods).

Are you/do you know of a shop/freelance team with expertise in these areas?
Alternatively, are you/do you know of a product design shop/freelance
designers with this expertise? I have a great engineering shop I could pair
a design team with.

Thank you in advance for considering who you may know!


Much love,

Tikva

For those looking for opportunities in COVID tracking, NY State is
beginning to hire contact tracers. See below.

---------- Forwarded message ---------

Subject: Join the NYC COVID Tracing team
To:


This may be a good opportunity for someone who has lost their job or works
as an independent contractor and has lost all gigs... Spread the word.





Dear Colleagues,



Please share this information with our communities!



We hope you are keeping healthy and safe during this COVID-19 pandemic. We
are reaching out today because you may have seen that the State of New York
launched a new ambitious and urgent effort to curb the spread of COVID-19.



The aim of this initiative will be to call every person diagnosed with
COVID-19, establish all contacts of this person, and proceed to call and
maintain ongoing communication with every contact. In addition, the team
will support the isolation and quarantine of individuals, as appropriate in
cooperation with the Local Health Department. This includes virtual needs
checks and referral to community resources as needed. This contact tracing
initiative is in tandem with statewide-wide efforts to increase testing,
improve communication and knowledge of effective strategies to reduce
transmission, and implementation of isolation and quarantine. This will
fortify efforts to control the pandemic in NYS.



New York State plans to hire a team of 6,400 to 17,000 staff statewide,
depending on the projected number of COVID-19 cases, to support the NYS
Department of Health (NYSDOH) and Local Health Departments (LHDs) to
perform contact tracing in communities across NYS. To meet the scale and
scope of this nation-leading program, Bloomberg Philanthropies,Vital
Strategies: Resolve to Save Lives and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health will support building the team through a three-step process:
recruitment, interviewing and training.



Our first goal is to help the state identify and recruit a robust Contact
Tracing team to be a part of this ambitious and urgent effort. To be
considered, candidates must be a New York State resident 18 years of age or
older; meet the position description requirement; go through an interview
process; and complete a training and certification program.



New York State is looking to immediately fill the following roles:

   - *Contact Tracers: *reach out to the contacts of anyone diagnosed with
   COVID-19 to assess symptoms, ensure compliance with quarantine and
   determine social support needs.
   - *Team Supervisors:  *lead a team of 20 Contact Tracers, and one
   Community Support Specialist who are working remotely using digital tools.
   - *Community Support Specialists: *work with the team and the local
   health departments to address the physical/mental health, and social/human
   service needs of those contacted, especially those who are under isolation
   or quarantine.



*Click here if you or someone you know in New York State is interested in
applying to be a part of the Contact Tracing team.*

This is a moment of crisis and New York needs our help as soon as possible.



Thank you!



P.S. Please share this with anyone in NYS in your networks who you think
might be interested in applying and post to your social media accounts!
