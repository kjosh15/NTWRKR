 I thought you might like this poem!  This chap sends the out every day to
my friend across the road, and she forwards them to me. We are a bit
mystified as to what Granelli's might be though. Clearly a grocery store.
Is it famous? IS it in NEw YOrk?
 Love to you all
Lyn

Dear all,

Today's poem expresses gratitude for the simple joy of being alive. I think
Granelli's must be an American grocery store of some sort, but extensive
googling has only got me as far as a *gelateria *in Macclesfield, which
doesn't seem to fit with this poem at all!

Anyway, the couple in this poem, about whom we are told nothing, show such
tremendous energy and zest for life that we are left rather breathless at
the end. The poet allows us both to revel in the ecstasy of this dance and
to find beauty in everything around them - there is so much loving
attention to detail here, from the "*peaches / bursting with ripeness in
their wicker baskets" *to the *"goat cheese sent down / from some green
mountain*" and, finally, "*the blue sky a sudden surprise.*" It is so
romantic, and perhaps encourages us to think about how we might waltz to
our own music through the day ahead of us, taking in every last detail and
sharing some of their *joie de vivre.*

Best wishes,

Stephen


*They Dance Through Granelli's *
*by Pat Hemphill Emile*

He finds her near the stack
of green plastic baskets waiting to be filled
and circles her waist with his left arm,
entwines her fingers in his, pulls her toward him,
Muzak from the ceiling shedding a flashy Salsa,
and as they begin to move, she lets
her head fall back, fine hair swinging
a beat behind as they follow
their own music=E2=80=94a waltz=E2=80=94past the peaches
bursting with ripeness in their wicker baskets,
the prawns curled into each other
behind cold glass, a woman in a turquoise sari,
her dark eyes averted. They twirl twice
before the imported cheeses, fresh mozzarella
in its milky liquid, goat cheese sent down
from some green mountain, then glide past
ranks of breads, seeds spread across brown crusts,
bottles of red wine nested together on their sides.
He reaches behind her, slides a bouquet
of cut flowers from a galvanized bucket, tosses
a twenty to the teenaged boy leaning
on the wooden counter, and they whirl
out the door, the blue sky a sudden surprise.
