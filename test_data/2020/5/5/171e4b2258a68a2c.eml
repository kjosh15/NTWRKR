You're definitely the first to make me feel good about making so little
money last year...! Are you around today for a quick conversation on what
to refund where? With the pandemic we've lost all expected earnings for Q1
and looks likely for Q2 also, so may want to keep some of the refund -
would love to get your take on what our estimates are for quarterly
payments in 2020 and how much of these refunds to apply to what.

Many thanks!
- J
