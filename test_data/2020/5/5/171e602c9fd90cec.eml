Congrats on the Panda - nicely done!

How about this?

"Remote workers are increasingly empowered - and stranded!
IndigoMetrics.com creates quantified models of behavior and beliefs so
employees know where they stand - and what to improve - relative to their
group and company."

I know, I'm crap at writing copy. What else can I do to help you?

All best,
Josh
