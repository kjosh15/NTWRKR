Steer of price
 Aggregate annual income
 2 is low, she would steer at 3-600
 Suggest 5

To start how quickly? Said would need 4 weeks to wrap up

All ballpark right now

Annike is HR they chose her because she challenges
Not because of her experience in learning
From talent acquisition to dev leaders
But she=E2=80=99s always been an HR business partner
She=E2=80=99s very direct to the CEO
Very Dutch
Doesn=E2=80=99t mind ideating, loves that
But then asks if it=E2=80=99ll really work
Very realistic about Takeda culture - very conservative

Big clash of culture
Z=C3=BCrich, (Singapore), Tokyo, Boston
Trying to balance that out
Anike is in Zurich

Really looking at their Hr approach - this is being created now
Lots of ideation
Team isn=E2=80=99t there yet
Not an easy gig - anike will be first to tell you

This role is coming directly from Christopher (ceo)
He=E2=80=99s thinking about his legacy - to pull people into being engaged =
and
motivated
Giving them agency I how and what they learn

I=E2=80=99ve got to paint a picture of what this could look like
Simple enough for anyone to understand

This is the most senior role in her team
The one anike is most excited about
Eventually she wants to create a bunch if roles
But for now has broken it up into chunks

So my legacy is to come in and ideate what this looks like

The job description will be likely diffeeent from what they=E2=80=99re doin=
g

Anike is concerned: can he make something in-house and make it happen?

Be specific about if I can create the right influence models AND a roadmap
to make it stick

Prove to her that I can bring people with me
AND actually build it

Give some examples of how/where I=E2=80=99ve done this, specifically

She=E2=80=99s quick, interested to talk to me for fun - but Ellie wants me =
to get
hired!

Can I deal with resistance in-house and manage process stuff

I=E2=80=99m driving this not just to the top exec, but everyone

All their staff are smart

Chris=E2=80=99 idea is that the receptionist in Malaysia needs to be able t=
o tap
into this

Creating a learning philosophy

This puts them ahead of the other guy

They=E2=80=99re big, but not too big!

Now is a time of chaos; when you can make all the changes

Be perceived not as an intellectual, but someone that can execute

Her boss: Padma, believes she needs someone who understands the fundamental
of learning methodologies

She=E2=80=99s seen what learning system look like; what=E2=80=99s to know I=
 can cover that

Anike recently had an accident with her foot
Right now frustrated as she can=E2=80=99t walk around
So you won=E2=80=99t see her face super clearly

-> txt Ellie immediately after to immediately do debrief call
