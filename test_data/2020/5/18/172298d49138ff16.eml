Mixed bag. Got an interview for a FT position at a pharma firm for
$500k, and an offer to work with a design firm for $50/hr. Wish I
wanted the former and not the latter...

That said, I spoke to an executive recruiter today who said hiring was
starting to ramp back up... but I'm an odd fish, esp. for corporate.
Finding the perfect snowflake that wants to hire me is going to take
time. How about you?
