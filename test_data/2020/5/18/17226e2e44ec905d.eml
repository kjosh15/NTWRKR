Wondering whether you could add the concept of "we always used to work =
in an office but now we probably wont" - think for leaders (and =
particularly HR leaders) it will be the practical manifestation of the =
COVID impact - and that they must have in the minds (conscious or =
otherwise) - "how will I project power when I can't line everyone up =
like soldiers". Everything else is abstract - "where will we work from" =
is very practical and doesn=E2=80=99t really depend upon how the world =
comes out of corona - so you may as well start now. Few comments in caps =
below:

Subject: I50 talk

Here's my rough notes. Let me know if you have any feedback!

- J

#######


### I50 Huddle Session: Architecting a Step Function in Human Capital =
Management ###

1. WTF is Josh?

Hacker story
Most important asset clearly human beings But to date all managed with =
fuzzy, vague qualitative impressions - no data!
That doesn't have to be the case anymore:
Indigo - short summary
growth has been slow because most HR professionals don't want to have =
their work quantified other priorities more pressing
AND BECAUSE MOST COMPANIES HAVE WORKED IN OFFICES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO =
PERSIST WITH 1960S PEOPLE AND CULTURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WELL PAST =
THEIR SELL BY DATE - HIERARCCHICAL ORGANISATIONS AND TEAM FORMATS, =
STATIC TEAMS, LINE MANAGER RESPOSNSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURE - =
AN ADULT TO CHILD APPROACH

2. The opportunity

This means you can now put in place those world-changing technologies =
and everyone is stoked HR professionals suddenly NEED this data =
employees def. need this data
"PUTTING 7000 PEOPLE IN A BUILDING IS A THING OF THE PAST" JESS STALEY, =
BARCLAYS . AND IF YOUR FACE TO FACE POWER PROJECTION AND FEEDBACK =
CHANNELS ARE CUT YOU NEED A NEW CHANNEL
COVID-10: what we've seen change on Indigo as a result For companies, =
you have a huge opportunity to put a step function change in place in =
how you manage people This suddenly fills a lot of what we've learned =
charactarizes successful companies:

purpose driven
quantified, measured, managed culture
a proliferation of data you can actually use training that is ongoing, =
continuous, personalized, and MEASURED FOR EFFICACY measurable =
psychological safety

3. What next?

Companies that do this will be much more successful because:

more autonomous employees - BUT WITHIN A SPECIFIC CULTURAL FRAMEWORK - =
AUTONOMOUS BUT NOT GENERIC/PORTABLE
greater alignment on brand
early identification of conduct risk
"" of training opportunities or other problems more dynamic teams =
iterative testing platform to facilitate extremely rapid response to new =
conditions (pandemics)

Adopting a statistically driven model for the humans in your company =
means:

mix-and-match teams according to projects, not divisions 3rd party =
integration more seamless no "tread in place" churn or stagnation within =
divisions

This also puts you in a great place to try OTHER radical changes, like =
adopting different technologies (slack? zoom? twitch?) or processes (4 =
day work week? Unweeking? 100% remote? Flat hierarchy?) etc.
