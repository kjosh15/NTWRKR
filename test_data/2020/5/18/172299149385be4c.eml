Genius! Super stoked to hear how it goes, and very very glad it's
working out (aside from the arduino issues) so far. Here's my top
tips:

This is a somewhat classic problem with the Arduino IDE. It involves
USB drivers and/or which USB port is being used. There are a few
possible remedies depending on the particular issue at hand, which
must first be identified. The very first thing to try is plugging the
Arduino into a different USB port. Particulary if using a desktop
Windows or Linux computer which features multiple types of USB ports.

Barring this, the best way to find help for this problem is to Google
"arduino port greyed out <operating system>." So, something like
"arduino port greyed out windows 10" or "arduino port greyed out OSX
catalina"

Do one of these searches for your operating system and see if he can't
find help that way. This problem affects a lot of users so there are a
lot of posts about it; it's a difficult one to try to help with
remotely from a cold start.

Let me know how it goes!!

best,
Josh
