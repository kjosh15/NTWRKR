Hey Josh and Chris,

So great speaking with you both earlier today! Wanted to share this deck
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wjY7J8qgF_zNxGOPlKwxZ3nGK2cvw3lsiC=
oUs1G71jE/edit#slide=3Did.g233f985894_0_48>
that reflects some very high-level, scrappy (emphasis on scrappy) digging I
did to prep for our call. I started formulating some initial insights and
dropped in screenshots of relevant research, as well as a quick look at
some competitors that felt the most comparable to IM.

It may or may not be helpful, but figured I'd pass along in case it
triggers something. If we continue thinking through the brand ID following
Wednesday, we'd do more desk research and triangulate those findings with
insights from talking with you both and some clients if possible.

Also, following our call, what do we think about: *Radical alignment that
builds resilience*? Just a quick thought, but I think it pays off what we
were discussing nicely.

Lastly, keep us posted on the outline. Once we get that, we'll start
pulling out the key statements and visualizations to highlight in the
presentation.

Thanks and talk soon.

>### I50 Huddle Session: Architecting a Step Function in Human Capital Mana=
gement ###<br><br>1. Who The Heck is Josh? (And why are we listening to him=
?)<br><br>My Hacker story<br>Saw three big new technologies change the worl=
d:<br>	E-Commerce<br>	Telecommunications (specifically MMS and app stores)<=
br>	Cloud computing / Big Data<br>In each case there were standout opportun=
ities to make big audacious changes... and the winners took all:<br>	E-comm=
erce: Amazon<br>	Telco: Apple<br>	Cloud: Google<br><br>2. indigoMetrics - a=
 case study for developing this kind of effort:<br><br>Early on in my consu=
ltancy I realized that org&#39;s most important assets are clearly human be=
ings<br>but to date all managed with fuzzy, vague qualitative impressions -=
 no data!<br>That doesn&#39;t have to be the case anymore:<br>Indigo - shor=
t summary<br>Solid growth, but slow because most companies have wanted to p=
ersist in 1960&#39;s style people and culture management practices: The Par=
ent to Child model<br>	big emphasis on hierarchy and team formats,<br>	stat=
ic teams,<br>	line manager responsibility for development and culture<br>	&=
quot;We will tell you what to do... then you do it.&quot;<br><br>3. COVID-1=
9: An Opportunity<br><br>what we&#39;ve seen change on Indigo as a result o=
f the crisis<br>&quot;Putting 7000 people in a building is a thing of the p=
ast&quot; Jess Staley, Barclays <br>F2F management and feedback channels ar=
e suddenly cut; a new channel is needed<br>Professionals also suddenly NEED=
 this data; no other feedback on how they&#39;re perceived<br>#&#39;s (See =
attached deck)<br>For companies, you have a huge opportunity to put a step =
function change in place in how you manage people <br>This suddenly fills a=
 lot of what we&#39;ve learned characterizes successful companies:<br>	purp=
ose driven<br>	quantified, measured, managed culture<br>	a proliferation of=
 data you can actually use training that is ongoing, continuous, personaliz=
ed, and MEASURED FOR EFFICACY measurable psychological safety<br>Best yet, =
because new tech adoption was forced so quickly, EVERYONE is amenable to ch=
ange in a way they weren&#39;t before<br>Companies that do this will be muc=
h more successful because:<br>	more autonomous employees within a specific =
cultural framework in which they&#39;re autonomous but not generic/portable=
<br>	greater alignment on brand<br>	early identification of conduct risk<br=
>	&quot;&quot; of training opportunities or other problems more dynamic tea=
ms iterative testing platform to facilitate extremely rapid response to new=
 conditions (pandemics)<br><br>Summary: I.e, we&#39;re now seeing significa=
nt growth with ideal customers; large multinationals who are suddenly ready=
 to transform themselves into true market leaders<br><br>4. What does that =
enable next?<br><br>Putting a platform like IndigoMetrics in place means th=
at you can then run even MORE experiments to test radical new formats in a =
way that shields you from risk:<br><br>We&#39;ve been seeing that adopting =
a statistically driven model for the humans in your company means:<br>	mix-=
and-match teams according to projects, not divisions <br>	3rd party integra=
tion more seamless <br>	no &quot;tread in place&quot; churn or stagnation w=
ithin divisions<br><br>This also puts you in a great place to try OTHER rad=
ical changes, like adopting different technologies (slack? zoom? twitch?) o=
r processes (4 day work week? Unweeking? 100% remote? Flat hierarchy?) etc.=
<br><br>5. But these kinds of radical changes are stock in trade for the op=
portunity in front of all of us!<br><br>Been looking at robotics? How about=
 trialing new use cases with an eye to scale?<br>Permanently remote teams<b=
r>dynamic teams<br>blockchain shared equity<br>new, scaled partnerships (wi=
th multiple new parties)<br>etc. etc. etc.<br>Need more radical examples he=
