Really worth reading. Used two vectors (high/low deaths, fast/slow economic
recovery) to plot four scenarios. Definitely a useful framework in watching
things unfold over this summer!

-        Scenario one: High deaths, prolonged depression. Signposts:
3            hot spots similar to NYC/CA in May/June
3            markets still not bottomed out, smaller banks fail June/July
3            no treatments that can serve as a bridge to a vaccine by Augus=
t
3            insufficient testing (infection and antibody) to support real
reopening by Sept.
3            no promising stage III trials, no significant investment in
production facilities by EOY 2020
-        Scenario two: High deaths, V-shaped recovery. Signposts:
3            May/June reopenings trigger hotspots that overwhelm hospitals,
triggering shutdowns accepted peacefully by residents
3            June/July produce a raft of innovations that support selective
return to activities in many areas
3            August no treatments in sight, but life is returning to normal
and lessons learned are implemented quickly
3            September first month of job gains reported



3            EOY treatments and vaccines still a year away, but "new
normal" is broadly accepted and Americans are optimistic
-        Scenario three: Low deaths, V-shaped recovery. Signposts:
3            May/June outbreaks are suppressed quickly and shutdown
communities do so without complaint. Overall optimism about pending
treatments.
3            June/July markets stabilize and volatility decreases overall
3            August a number of treatments get FDA approval while
manufacturing capability scales up quickly
3            October fast, accurate seriology and infection testing is
available in local venues like schools and supermarkets, pointing to a
full-scale reopening
3            EOY multiple vaccines are in Phase III trials with promising
indications of approval by early 2021. Massive manufacturing capabilities
are in development.
-        Scenario four: Low deaths, prolonged depression. Signposts:
3            May/June reopenings trigger outbreaks, but efforts to impose
lockdowns trigger mass protests led by conservatives
3            June/July country largely divides between red states and blue
states with gun sales doubling in the latter
3            August an ambiguous picture of vaccines and treatments fuels
political argument, with democrats insisting they're not ready and
republicans insisting it's worth the risk
3            September the economy is hit by new market lows due to growing
foreclosures, bankruptcies, and bank failures. Each new stimulus has less
of an effect.
3            EOY Depression 2.0 is common parlance. Consumer spending falls
by 35%, the 10 year treasury trades near zero, and S+P is near 1000.
