Just saying howdy - I hope all is well for you and yours!!

Over here there are lots of interesting shifts in the business world and
some very cool opportunities, also looking to head to Iceland in a few
weeks so change continues apace.

Happy to connect to compare notes if that sounds interesting, otherwise
just wanted to make sure you were doing well.

All best wishes,
Josh
