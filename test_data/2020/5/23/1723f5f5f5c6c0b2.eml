Think we need to build a longer/larger development roadmap to serve large cu=
stomers so we=E2=80=99re better positioned for an M&A conversation.

Also, do you have any leads on getting the Gartner report mentioned here? Wo=
uld be extremely useful.

Finally, I think we=E2=80=99re really headed towards a sweet spot for Indigo=
Metrics in terms of acquisition - if we can demonstrate scale and keep our r=
etention numbers high we could fit a very nice niche for big players looking=
 to expand capability in this space.
