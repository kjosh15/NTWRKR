Keeping busy pushing my startup (which is seeing excellent growth since
remote work became a "must have"), negotiating with a Toronto firm on a
project that could potentially open up tourism again, and am in discussions
with a Boston pharma company about leading their L&D initiative through a
digital lens.

Otherwise trying to get everything wrapped up for us to go to Iceland in a
month in case we don't come back.

So, exciting times here also. Want to schedule a call to compare notes? I
agree that now is the time for big bold initiatives!
