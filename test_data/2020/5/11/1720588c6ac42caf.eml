Hey Josh K!

I hope things are well with you and that you and your family are safe and
healthy during this crazy time.

I thought I'd send this your way as well; let me know if you're
interested in participating!

Let us know if you need anything. I look forward to the day when we can all
hang out again.

Best,

Chelsea Johnson

Hi guys!

As some of you may remember, this Thursday, May 14th is Josh's 45th
birthday. As we are all still experiencing the shelter-in-place, I have
only very few options--and relatively no in-person opportunities--to
celebrate his special day. As such, I thought it would be fun if each of
you could record a short video of yourself wishing Josh a happy birthday
that I could splice together in order to give him the essence of a "party"
and accolade he deserves. He speaks so highly of you all (maybe with the
exception of a few weeks ago when you all zoomed together and he woke up in
pretty bad form thanks to all of the "online" drinking....) and I know it
would mean so much to him to see all your faces and be given warm wishes on
behalf of his brother family.

If you could record a message and either email it to me at this address, or
text it to me (916-284-0882; although email is preferred for better visual)=
 *on
or before May 13th*, that will give me enough time to put something
together. I realize this may not allot for enough time; I had to go through
great lengths to find your emails without Josh's knowing so it's taken some
time. I apologize for making such demands so late in the game....

I could also only get a hold of the emails here. If you recognize an
incorrect email (people still use hotmail? =F0=9F=98=84), and/or know who e=
lse is not
included, can you please send this request his way? I'll buy you a full 12
pack of cyber beer in gratitude.

Also, please try to keep this a surprise! I know you are all set to meet
again tonight at 9pm--so don't mention anything to Josh.

Thanks again for participating! I hope we can all get together again soon!

Best,

Chelsea Johnson (Josh's girlfriend)
