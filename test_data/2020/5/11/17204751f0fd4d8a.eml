I am working with a service company called
https://www.polarama.is/polarama/  -they
are just landing a big production from Germany. We are very keen to get
projects over or be co-producers. The good thing about using services in
Iceland is that we can apply for the 25% tax-break.

If you have a production that makes sense to partly or fully produce in
Iceland I have all the connections you need.
