I recently did a video interview with Annalisa Gigante, Former CTO &
SVP Innovation, LafargeHolcim, about =E2=80=9CInnovating Under Pressure.=E2=
=80=9D I
thought you and your clients might find it interesting - we cover the
gamut, from tech innovation to winning innovation characteristics to
how an innovation mindset can carry a company through crisis. Let me
know what you think!

se are extraordinary times!

for these things given the pandemic? Normally I'd charge ~$25 for the keyno=
te, but under the circumstances would expect to have to be flexible. Not su=
re what to charge for the breakout session either as pricing there is even =
more variable; what do you think the client is looking for?
