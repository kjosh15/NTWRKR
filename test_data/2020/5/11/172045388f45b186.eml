Wyatt,

The three times we've seen this, one was a bad servo and two were bad
power supplies. If you've independently tested your servo and power
supply consider if the problem might be:

-A bad Arduino board. This would likely involve a clone that is
not-to-spec, and/or an Arduino board which was damaged in another
project before being used in the Crowbox.

-A wiring error. (This is the most frequent problem.)

Can you send a photo of the electronics sled so that we can see the
Arduino and the breadboard and review the wiring visually? Also, do
you have any details about the Arduino board (is it a clone or a
Genuino? Is it new or has it been used for other projects before this
one)?

Thanks!
- J
