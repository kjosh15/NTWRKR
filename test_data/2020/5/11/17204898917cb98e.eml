We try to be in Iceland in July/August for the kids; my in-laws have a
summer house they give us (and a car!) so it's been hard to say no -
especially now!

Lockdown in NYC is ok; what will be interesting is to see how different
places begin to come out of this.

6 edits plus post? All remote? You DO know how to have fun! Sounds like a
cool series, in any case!

Final note: I have access to a service company called
https://www.polarama.is/polarama/ which can help you apply for the 25%
tax-break. If you have a production that makes sense to partly or fully
produce in Iceland I have all the connections you need!

All best wishes,
Josh

Generally a good vibe going on and all the parks are still open for
exercising and walking etc so that=E2=80=99s a blessing. I=E2=80=99m Series=
 Producing a
series for Nat Geo about archaeology in Egypt at the moment. Running 6
edits plus post production, with every individual person working at home -
which is extremely weird. But we seem to be managing it!
