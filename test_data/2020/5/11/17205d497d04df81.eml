Hi,=C2=A0So good to hear from you - I am fine and so is my whole family for=
tunately =F0=9F=91=8D and I hope you and your family are doing fine as well
Life is so weird right now - eventhough my life hasn t changed so much =F0=
=9F=98=89...I started a new job in January and I haven t regretted it one s=
econd...long story but 2019 was not very nice (the merger of of our institu=
tion was more or less a takover and HR a very important asset...and I was n=
ot wanted there =F0=9F=A4=A3...anyway, sometimes it s really good that you =
don't get what you want...
So, yes indeed life in NY must be strange too right now - no travelling, st=
aying home and doing whatever...I had planned a lot of holiday trips in the=
 first 6 months....never did that before and well, guess what...only one tr=
ip to Paris at the beginning of february took place =F0=9F=98=82....and I g=
ot really sick right after that trip - I m not sure but maybe that was that=
 corona virus - I ll probably never know, but I keep telling everbody that =
I m "untouchable" =F0=9F=98=89

So how is life treating you right now?I talked to Christel on the phone...t=
hey are doing fine as well
Love to hear from youUlli
