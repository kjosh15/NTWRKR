Thoughts? The exclusive for one year is a big problem to my mind - esp. as
I've now tee'd up conversations with F212 and Bow and Arrow to make similar
pitches. Let me know if you can think of a clever way around this, and/or
if you want to chat briefly tomorrow prior to my responding.

Hi Josh,

Thanks for your patience. Despite appearances, I remain incredibly eager to
figure out a way to partner.

The state of the world is keeping me pulled in too many directions and I've
been getting tripped up by solving for long-term possibilities like
acquisition or other major events, positive or negative. Given the current
state of things, when we can=E2=80=99t even see what=E2=80=99s going to hap=
pen next week,
I=E2=80=99m choosing to feel liberated from the long term and hope to simpl=
ify
terms.

Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99m thinking...

   - We provide some design and strategy services to focus the Indigo story
   to increase credibility and reduce pitch time. Not a comprehensive brand=
ing
   program, but more of a "Minimum Viable Brand" approach. Perhaps some
   marketing automation recommendations as well.
   - We get free use of the platform for our organization.
   - We become your exclusive consulting partner for one year. Renewable.
   - You provide us the platform free of charge to offer to clients for the
   6-week "diagnostic" period.
   - If the client chooses to continue beyond that period, we get a
   percentage of the contract value once you recoup the cost of the free 6
   week period.

Approaching that way has two benefits: 1) offsetting the potential "big
event" challenge by putting money in our hands sooner for each successful
conversion, and 2) increases our incentive to recommend the platform in
more scenarios and to more types of clients and even non-clients.

Just need to know your cost structures and we're done rather than dealing
with shares and valuations and such. Much simpler.

Let me know your thoughts. I=E2=80=99m eager to chat =E2=80=94 happy to do =
it over Zoom
tomorrow or you can just email when you have a moment.

Michael
