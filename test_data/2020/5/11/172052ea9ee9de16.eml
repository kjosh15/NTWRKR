Been slowly reaching out to all the best people I know; I hope you and
yours are safe and healthy!! We're in NYC five blocks from Elmherst
hospital (the epicenter of the epicenter) and looking at a ton of
opportunities to make the world better. If you get a chance, let me
know you're ok and what you're up to!

All best wishes,
Josh
