This was a useful overview of the various testing elements we should
be building towards:

https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/saas-testing/

For example, are we currently doing functional, performance and unit
testing? So far, the biggest contenders for automated testing
platforms are:

#1) PractiTest
#2) qTest
#3) QMetry

Also worth looking at:

testim
testcraft
ElectroNeek RPA
ACCELQ
TestProject
LambdaTest

One thing to note is that PractiTest is the only SOC2 Type 2 and ISO
27001 compliant test management tool, making it the most secured QA
system in the market - and they have excellent support.

I'll go through the above and get a better sense of features tomorrow,
but wanted to get the above to you now. I'm assuming free is better
than paid, and that paid is better than ineffective...

best,
Josh
