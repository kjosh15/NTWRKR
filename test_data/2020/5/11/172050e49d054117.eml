Hi Josh,

Thanks for your patience. Despite appearances, I remain incredibly eager to
figure out a way to partner.

The state of the world is keeping me pulled in too many directions and I've
been getting tripped up by solving for long-term possibilities like
acquisition or other major events, positive or negative. Given the current
state of things, when we can=E2=80=99t even see what=E2=80=99s going to hap=
pen next week,
I=E2=80=99m choosing to feel liberated from the long term and hope to simpl=
ify
terms.

Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99m thinking...

   - We provide some design and strategy services to focus the Indigo story
   to increase credibility and reduce pitch time. Not a comprehensive brand=
ing
   program, but more of a "Minimum Viable Brand" approach. Perhaps some
   marketing automation recommendations as well.
   - We get free use of the platform for our organization.
   - We become your exclusive consulting partner for one year. Renewable.
   - You provide us the platform free of charge to offer to clients for the
   6-week "diagnostic" period.
   - If the client chooses to continue beyond that period, we get a
   percentage of the contract value once you recoup the cost of the free 6
   week period.

Approaching that way has two benefits: 1) offsetting the potential "big
event" challenge by putting money in our hands sooner for each successful
conversion, and 2) increases our incentive to recommend the platform in
more scenarios and to more types of clients and even non-clients.

Just need to know your cost structures and we're done rather than dealing
with shares and valuations and such. Much simpler.

Let me know your thoughts. I=E2=80=99m eager to chat =E2=80=94 happy to do =
it over Zoom
tomorrow or you can just email when you have a moment.

Michael

"><div dir=3D"ltr">We have lots of data relating to different review questi=
ons as we collect question level data and as we ask reviews. It&#39;s not p=
ure multivariate testing as we rarely get to ask different questions to sim=
ilar employee pools, but it is useful data.<br><br>We are most interested i=
n questions that generate a good level of dispersion and consistency across=
 participants, and we track how each question performs against these metric=
s. We also use this testing to inform how we suggest questions are worded.<=
br><br>However, at least in the first instance, we have found that it is mo=
re important that the questions reflect the way that culture and values are=
 defined at the host organization, and the particular language / tone of vo=
ice used.<br><br>This is because the formation of the questions themselves =
embed the target values / behaviors / tone of voice. So essentially, a ques=
tion that is worded correctly according to the definition of values (but pr=
oduces sub-optimal data) is better than a question that is worded optimally=
 from a psychometric data generation perspective but does not reflect the v=
alues and tone of voice of the organization.<br><br>Over time, the process =
of reviewing against the questions can change a way that an organization de=
fines its target culture and allow us to use more optimally worded question=
s =E2=80=93 but we don=E2=80=99t want to force that process as the uniquene=
ss of the host culture is the primary reference point that we are looking t=
o quantify against.<br><br>Obviously this all plays into how a company defi=
nes itself and revises that understanding - all stuff that&#39;s ripe for B=
ig Spaceship to play with! Looking forward to more on Monday.<br><br>Be wel=
