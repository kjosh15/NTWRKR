Yes now is the time to bring ideas to Iceland. Best if you have the =
investment with you - the film industry seems to be thriving with =
Netflix announcing that Iceland and South Korea being the only two =
places where it is save to film. Some few big projects coming over for =
location work and using the task force that has now reached ww standard.=20=


You should definitely speak to Halla at the Design Centre and deign guru =
Paul Bennet who now has a house in Iceland. =
https://www.facebook.com/paul.bennett.944 =
<https://www.facebook.com/paul.bennett.944>

the ad-hoc conversation would be a fantastic added value for older =
children and adults. I think with Harry and Odinn most parents need =
something fixed or a programme to stick to. Would be interesting to have =
a brainstorm when we are all in Iceland.=20
