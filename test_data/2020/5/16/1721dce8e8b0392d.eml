If you can find someone to make it for you! :) We don't offer kits for
sale, however.

That said, do check out the videos, guides, and supporting material at
www.thecrowbox.com - it takes some time and attention, but we've
gotten lots of positive feedback that building your own is really
rewarding!

All best,
Josh
