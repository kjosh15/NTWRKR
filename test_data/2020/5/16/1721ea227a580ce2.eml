What I want to tell them is that:

Algorithmically encouraged alignment of belief used to be considered
potentially useful to desperately needed in a couple of weeks.

Here=E2=80=99s why, and the evidence we found for it...

And here=E2=80=99s what it means the future could be like...

-> these are the sorts of opportunities we should be looking for now. Big,
audacious, critically different ways to do things with resources we already
have today or tomorrow.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Otherwise, how about:

- permeable organizations

- fractal subsidiaries using crypto contracts to share value.

- purchasable citizenship

- dynamic value chains based on reworking parameters.

Or...?

- J
