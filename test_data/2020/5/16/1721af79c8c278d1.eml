out how we can make sure Alexia gets better stimulated the idea came that w=
e should do regular zoom sessions with her. Following that I thought of an =
online language school. We would start by developing this for Icelandic chi=

 for different nationalities. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=

fternoon school through Skype. It would be done live so the children can in=
teract with the app. 10 at the time and they will have a teacher or two tha=
t speaks to them and guides them in the theme or method we use. We would ce=
ntre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur and with the teachers we have there =
to start with and as part of Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But i=
