Nice compliment for me on the video instructions :)

This is a somewhat classic problem with the Arduino IDE. It involves USB
drivers and/or which USB port is being used. There are a few possible
remedies depending on the particular issue at hand, which must first be
identified.

The very first thing to try is plugging the Arduino into a different USB
port. Particular if using a desktop Windows or Linux computer which offer
features multiple types of USB ports.

Barring this, the best way to find help for this problem is to Google
"arduino port greyed out <operating system>"

so, something like "arduino port greyed out windows 10" or "arduino port
greyed out OSX catalina"

Have Joe do one of these searches for his operating system and see if he
can't find help that way. This problem affects a lot of users so there are
a lot of posts about it.

I'm happy to try to help further if I can but it's likely he'll find a
solution this way. It's a difficult one to try to help with remotely from a
cold start.
