Hi Josh,

Three important things I'm hoping I can get you to look at today:

*FOR YOU *:: Next Wednesday, June 3 at 11:15 a.m EDT we will have a "round
2" members-only conversation with Hubert Joly
<https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/former-best-buy-ceo-hubert-joly-defied-exp=
ectations-at-best-buy.html>.
In case you missed it, Joly led an inspirational conversation at the
Innovating 50 Summit
<https://app.world50.com/LibraryItem?previousScreen=3DForYou&title=3DInnova=
ting%2050%20May%202020%20Summit%20Insights&type=3Dinsights&url=3Dhttps%3A%2=
F%2Fmi.w50.com%2Fdocuments%2F%3F%2FInnovating50May2020SummitInsights>
a
few weeks ago. He concluded the conversation asking members to reflect on
his thoughts on the key business and consumer changes resulting from
COVID-19. So next week, we'll all jump on Zoom for collaborative banter
with Joly and each other about what the world will look like in the near
future. Ashley will be sending a calendar invitation soon - please plan to
join us if you can, even for just a portion.

*Mapping the New Normal :: An Innovating 50 Huddle Call with Hubert Joly*
*Building on the conversation he had with members at the most recent
Innovating 50 Summit, Hubert Joly, executive chairman and former CEO of
Best Buy, joins members for a working session exploring the fundamental
changes to business and consumer trends in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.
Armed with predictions from his work with Michael Porter at Harvard
Business School, Joly shares where he anticipates lasting changes, while
members weigh in on what they are seeing in their own organizations and
across the global business landscape.*


*FOR YOUR PEERS *:: What is the new normal for you personally and/or
professionally? I recently posted a One=C2=B0 asking members to share one t=
hing
they will drop and one thing they will adopt
<https://app.world50.com/discussions/post/35e46554-a3fd-4d64-b558-e215b4510=
b37?previousScreen=3DGroups>as
a result of this crisis. Please either hit reply and share your answers (I
will post for you) or comment online.

*FOR YOU OR YOUR TEAM* :: Tomorrow (or today depending on when you read
this), we have an incredible World 50 Engage Call with the CEOs of Zoom,
Slack, Box and Okta discussing the future of work. This is one that your
team, peers or colleagues can join if you're unable to make it. It's sure
to be a fascinating conversation with some of the most innovative Chief
Executives in this area. The call will take place at 11:00 a.m. EDT. Join
here

50349?h=3DY84nOfcJ-KQg4jYuHzADdj8qxrJGHzBh31HaSvjRxkM>
-
or let us know who to invite from your team.

*The Future of Work With the CEOs of Zoom, Slack, Box and Okta*

*As companies continue to grapple with the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, leaders have been challenged to adapt their organizations to a
=E2=80=9Cnew normal=E2=80=9D by heavily leveraging digital platforms and ne=
w technologies.
The CEOs of Slack, Zoom, Okta and Box are no strangers to the digital-first
mindset, overseeing budgets of billions of dollars while managing large,
distributed workforces across the globe. Stewart Butterfield, Eric Yuan,
Todd McKinnon and Aaron Levie join World 50 members to discuss rethinking
communication and collaboration and the future of digitally integrated
workplaces.*

That's it for now. Apologies for the lengthy email!

Best,
Mike
