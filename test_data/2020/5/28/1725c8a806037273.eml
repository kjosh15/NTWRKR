Just reaching out to see if I can be of any help in this weird, weird time
in human history. From my vantage point the world of tech innovation has
been dying off entirely in some areas and doubling down in others, with
rapid opportunity occurring right next to catastrophic losses - how are
things going in your world?

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
