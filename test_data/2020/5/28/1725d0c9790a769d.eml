Clayton,

Apologies for the long email; the short version is that Choong has done a
wide variety of deep technology work, including building (and selling to
Intel) an AI company focused on deep learning, and is developing and idea
around using purchasing data as a proxy for proximity in track-and-trace of
COVID-19.

I.e., if a cardholder identifies as having Covid-19, it should be possible
to alert other cardholders who were at the same place at around the same
time. The motivation for making robust alternative avenues for tracing as a
separate organization is to provide trust through independence (e.g.
Switzerland), avoid encumbering the card companies with HIPAA data, and
allow greater scale through limited cooperation with competitors.

There is a key functional addition to human tracing and the phone-based
Bluetooth tracking: you could be exposed to someone else without seeing
them just by visiting the same space after them. It's looking like
infectious droplets can hang in the air for 30 minutes or more. So in
addition to phone-based proximity and known close contacts this capability
is the third pillar in finding contacts.

I've included a bio for Choong below and he is currently building out a
more robust framework for describing the project, including functional
design, cardholder pitch, branding, trust challenges, stakeholders &
integration points, technical infrastructure. Let me know who we should
speak to next!

All best wishes,
Josh

This brief bio summarizes the work Choong has done followed by some
selected projects that are unusual or are directly transferable experience:

I am a technologist and entrepreneur with extensive experience from the
seed of a startup idea to exit. Over the years I have had the privilege of
working with talented people in areas including deep learning, computer
security, and mesh networking. As co-founder and CEO I led Vertex.AI and
negotiated its sale to Intel. As a consultant I have prototyped, shipped,
rescued, and advised on a broad range of software efforts. Other roles
include Principal Software Engineer at the Pioneer Square Labs venture
studio, Manager for Security, Wireless and Advanced Technologies / Special
Assistant to the CEO at Unium Technologies (acquired by Nokia), Senior
Software Engineer and Tech Lead for Security at IMVU, Technical Program
Manager at Intel, and Security Analyst at Microsoft.

IMVU: When I was there IMVU's primary product was a consumer 3D chat
product. I was tech lead for security and worked in the CASH monetization
group. In CASH we did extensive work on behavioral data collection, third
party integrations, user onboarding, etc, in a always-on production
environment. There are many lessons out of that work in terms of how to run
an operationally complex service with external dependencies including
payment processors.

BTLE indoor location system: For an undisclosed client I built the software
back end for a realtime indoor location service. The system was used to
track people second-to-second and provide paging services at large events.
The system used Bluetooth beacons and radio triangulation with a special
antenna array, and the technical problems and sheer volume of data yield
some transferrable lessons for a contact tracing system. There are
organizational lessons out of this on how to integrate different functions
(hardware, RF, software, client), manage personal privacy, etc.

PSL: While at PSL I got to look into some of the portfolio companies for
lessons learned. Two in particular are interesting: Attunely is a machine
learning system for driving efficiency in debt collection. They have really
tricky PII and regulatory issues that they've solved to get in the market.
SigmaIQ makes an automated accounting (account reconciliation) product.
Lessons learned there inform 3rd party data integration & challenges
applying ML to transaction data.

Finally, Vertex.AI: There I built the team that built a foundational piece
of deep learning infrastructure, led operations and technology development,
and ultimately sold it into Intel where today it is core to their ML/AI
software stack. Through that I gained practial understanding of the whole
stack from customer data down to chip design. It also built a network from
which I can recruit for any of those specialties.
