Brilliant, thanks! And yes, can only imagine how things must be rolling
over there right now...

Glad to hear Launchpad is getting even more central. As per our discussion
last time, that's the smartest possible response to the current situation,
and unfortunately a relatively rare one. Good on BP for managing so well.

In regards to next steps:

- Ruth Penfold: please do let me know when she might be available for a
quick call. We're seeing some startling uptake due to the pandemic and
would love to see if there's alignment.

- Advisory Board: this looks like an incredible chance to have a
significant positive impact as BP makes some radical changes. Plus, I'd
clearly be the dumbest person in the room which is always desirable. Let me
know how the revision in light of the re-org goes and how/if I can
contribute.

Unless I hear otherwise I'll ping you again in a week or so. Don't want to
spam your inbox, so let me know if you'd like more breathing room.

All best,
Josh
