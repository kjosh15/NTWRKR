Simon,

Thanks again for taking the time to chat today; as ever I learned a ton,
and the lambs were a charming surprise!!

I've been talking with the CMO of one of the largest producers of
Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) for diabetics. My posit is that clinical
trials with non-insulin using Type II diabetics showing positive behavior
change could expand the market for use of CGMs by all types of diabetics,
and ultimately prediabetics. The big question is what payers would want to
see from a trial to indicate paying for the device for a larger pool of
users.

Do you know anyone who could help me get a handle on this?

Very much obliged,
Josh
