Wanted to touch base given the pandemic; I've had a number of large
corporate clients who are getting conflicting information on critical
issues like privacy, etc. from their normal sources and am creating a lot
of impact clearing it up quickly.

At the same time, the psychometrics platform we discussed last year has had
a significant pivot and is now turning out to be a lifeline for newly
remote workers - and their managers. Let me know if it's worth a brief
followup to discuss!

All best wishes,
Josh

&gt; Rob and Josh,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I wanted to send this so you can reconnect, after originally meeting a=
t the March 2016 Finance 50 Summit.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Rob - Josh was a featured guest at the summit, talking about new techn=
ologies, cyber-security and &quot;white hat&quot; hacking.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Josh - Rob is the CFO of Merck and heard your session at the Summit, a=
nd thinks there may be an opportunity for you to work together.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I hope you have a chance to reconnect over the next week or two.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; All the best,<br>
&gt;<br>
