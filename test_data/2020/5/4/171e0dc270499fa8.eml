Apologies for the delay! As companies are startling to settle into their
new reality the technology innovation advisory space is heating up...

I think you're on the right track with your thinking, although I'd love to
see what existing online platforms exist that we could either emulate or
leverage. I know there are teaching platforms, language coaching platforms,
pairing platforms for speakers and learners, etc. etc. At the very least
you'd want a system that supported ranking and best-in-class curriculums,
with some sort of crowd ranking system to surface the best content and
teachers.

To kick it all off, though, some sort of pilot is probably the way to go.
How would you see that looking, and what key metrics would you look for to
evaluate success?
