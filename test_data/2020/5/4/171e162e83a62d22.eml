Bala,

Long time no speak! I've been in conversations with the CMO of Abbot (they
made the 5m Covid-19 tests). Do you have any connection to the
international airport, or any government folks who might like to pilot a
border testing regime with them? No commitments yet, but it definitley
looks like something that will be needed in future, and I'd love to see
Iceland pilot it.

Hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
