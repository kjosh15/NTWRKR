Still thinking about Ellipsis. In fact, I was just talking to the head of
BP's R&D division, Launchpad, and it occurred to me that they might be
another potential partner, which made me realize that auto was a sector I
hadn't heard you mention. Have you looked at this, esp. in terms of
cross-continental shipping and transport?

So yes, please let me know more as you learn it. In the meantime, and
knowing that you're running flat-out, it'd be good to get some numbers and
paperwork in place for the initial opportunity we discussed. This so we can
get into it faster if Ellipsis folds, and also to facilitate jumping into
Ellipsis faster if it takes off.

Feel free to hit me with high-level thinking on this: again, my goal here
is to expedite the process off-band while we're waiting for more clarity.
Matt, let me know if you have any arm-twisting tips in the interim!
