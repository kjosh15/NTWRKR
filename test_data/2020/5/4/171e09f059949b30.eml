Yup. Believe me, I'm counting my blessings that I pushed so hard to get
citizenship!! Quarantining and socially distancing is hard, but doing it in
a national forest in Iceland, where the risk is so low and we're so
isolated anyway, ought to be a welcome change. We'll wait and see what
happens in NYC while we're there - chances are the evidence will mount that
children aren't carriers (they haven't been treated as such in places such
as Switzerland, for example) - so school may resume in the fall as normal,
in which case we'll be back for the kids. And, of course, there's always
hope for some sort of treatment.

But in the meantime, we all know what has worked - in Taiwan, S. Korea, and
in Iceland: widespread testing, track-and-trace, and social isolation. So
far the USA is 1 for 3... kind of.

Love,
Josh
