We're five blocks from the epicenter in NYC, so it's been really wild.
Both my kids now recognize two types of vehicles: ambulances, and
refrigerator trucks...

Sorry to hear about Coen's aunt, and glad to hear your sister and
family pulled through. Fortunately none of our family have gotten it,
but yes - it's closing in on us all.

Outside of the prevailing climate of death (and, in the US, increasing
socioeconomic collapse) it's been great, however. Kids are thriving
studying mostly at home, their school is kicking ass at remote
learning, and I've got a growing bunch of opportunities to do really
cool work (assuming contracts actually get signed...) Plus we're
looking to head to Iceland in a month, which will be a much
appreciated relief. What are you up to outside of walking in fields
(???)
