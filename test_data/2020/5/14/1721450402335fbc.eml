 to do a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon school through Skype. It wo=
uld be done live so the children can interact with the app. 10 at the time =
and they will have a teacher or two that speaks to them and guides them in =
the theme or method we use. We would centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0=
ur and with the teachers we have there to start with and as part of Tungum=
=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But if the idea has a bigger potential I=
