Neda,

Curious to get your thoughts on the IONChannel call yesterday. I'd
love to find a way to get this up and running!

AFAIK, there should be some details available in whatever release
notes the ECCMA/EMDB provide to paying customers, and/or we could get
together a software inventory to monitor. That could be a scrub of
open source (e.g. Apache server) software used internally (a la
Equifax) or commercial packages.

Who do you think I should push for one of the above, or do you think
just waiting and scheduling another call is the next best bet?

Thanks so much!!
