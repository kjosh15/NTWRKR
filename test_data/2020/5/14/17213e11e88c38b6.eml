Mike,

You'd asked for a brief on the MVP brand work. I'm not sure what I
don't know, so please feel free to correct - this is def. not our area
of expertise!

Because we developed Indigo slowly, over time, and in response to a
wide variety of customer engagements we don't have a clear, cogent,
succinct brand story. COVID-19 has complicated this (in a good way)
because remote workers seem to really thrive on the platform, and
employers are suddenly eager to engage new services like ours. But we
haven't defined that value proposition well yet, and don't have
material to facilitate a sales conversation reg.

At a guess, I'd say IndigoMetrics could really benefit from:

- Marketing collateral:
new website,
pitch deck,
overview deck,
white paper,
case studies,
overview video,
onboarding documentation
- Thought leadership guidelines; what kind of content in which mediums
aimed at which outcomes to allow opportunistic AND targeted output
- Cogent brand identity with key features, growth narrative, and ideal
customer overview to guide business development
- Marketing plan, near- and long-term

In terms of which aspects have urgency/time drivers, we're looking to
do the W50 session with senior executives next week or the week after,
have ongoing introductions with a variety of prospective clients, and
may have access to new outlets such as CNBC in the near future. Thus,
we need the last pieces first - i.e., I'd expect that a clear brand
identity would drive marketing plans would drive marketing
collateral... but I want to send the collateral out immediately.

To summarize, I'd say that we're getting traction when we describe the
platform face-to-face, but that whenever we move to virtual assets we
fall a little flat. We are getting access to the right decision
makers: getting them polished assets could really help in
disseminating our messaging and securing clients. Beyond that we need
clear thinking about our brand and how to express that most
effectively.

Let me know what you think I'm missing and what we can focus on first!

All best,
Josh
