Got it, although I'm curious what you're doing roaming around in N Africa.

As for work, I'm in the same boat - had a number of pretty plumb gigs
to choose from and was starting negotiations when COVID hit. We're
five blocks from Elmherst hospital (the epicenter in NYC) so
everything just fell over. Now all my speeches for the year are
cancelled and we're still trying to close one or two contracts...

Am I understanding right that your best target is as an artist/design
lead in a research arm of a big company? I don't want to waste your
time, but I'm currently doing a ton of networking outreach, mostly to
senior execs for large multinationals. If you can help me position
what you really want to do I can probably suggest you as a strategic
initiative - but I'm not going to be especially useful for generic
"need a PM?" asks.

That said, I'm of course happy to keep my eyes peeled and mouth open
about your availability - my ongoing posit is that folks who can
thrive doing remote work in uncertain environments with strong
technology chops are going to become the new global elite workforce,
which is to say I'm happy to pitch you as a highly desirable peer!

Let me know if I can help further,
Josh
