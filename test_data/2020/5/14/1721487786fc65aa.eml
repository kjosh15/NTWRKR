Joshua,

I read this article when you sent it. In thinking about it, I see a 
number of "flaws" insofar as applying the results to the US population.

Note that the tendency to find work was higher in immigrants. This does 
not bode well for the extant US unemployed.

The article makes no mention of statistical significance of the 78 more 
days worked by the test subjects vs the generally unemployed. E.g., the 
difference may by very significant or completely insignificant.

It is noted that families with children had a higher rate of employment. 
Was this also the case in the generally unemployed group? Intuitively, 
one would think that families with children would be more inclined to 
find employment. - Allow me to offer that while the aforementioned may 
be true in Europe, it is my thought that there is a large portion of the 
chronically unemployed in the US that feel they are entitled to 
governmental support and tend to "work the system" rather than work at a 
job. A guaranteed wage would occupy these people full-time trying to 
further milk the system rather than actually work.

Who wouldn't feel financially better off and be mentally happier with a 
guaranteed income? If you told the generally unemployed they could have 
unemployment as long as they weren't working , they too would feel more 
secure and mentally happier. DUH!

Given the general US governmental attitude toward "political 
correctness" trying to give US citizens a guaranteed income during/after 
Covid-19 would bankrupt - Seriously - bankrupt the country. The 
democrats would want every illegal alien (euphemistically referred to as 
"undocumented aliens") to receive such payment. The country is already 
in such a bad way it is being compared to the 1930's depression. We've 
given away 3 trillion dollars and will likely give away another 3 
trillion. Where do you propose we get trillions upon trillions more to 
give to everyone?

The article ends with:

“Money matters, but alone it’s not sufficient to significantly promote 
either labour supply or demand,” said Ylikännö.

Basically, the study shows people are happier if they know they are to 
receive money, no matter what. No surprise here.

Love,

DAD
