### I50 Huddle Session: Architecting a Step Function in Human Capital
Management ###

1. WTF is Josh?

Hacker story
Most important asset clearly human beings
But to date all managed with fuzzy, vague qualitative impressions - no data!
That doesn't have to be the case anymore:
Indigo - short summary
growth has been slow because most HR professionals don't want to have
their work quantified
other priorities more pressing

2. The opportunity

This means you can now put in place those world-changing technologies
and everyone is stoked
HR professionals suddenly NEED this data
employees def. need this data
COVID-10: what we've seen change on Indigo as a result
For companies, you have a huge opportunity to put a step function
change in place in how you manage people
This suddenly fills a lot of what we've learned charactarizes
successful companies:

purpose driven
quantified, measured, managed culture
a proliferation of data you can actually use
training that is ongoing, continuous, personalized, and MEASURED FOR EFFICACY
measurable psychological safety

3. What next?

Companies that do this will be much more successful because:

more autonomous employees
greater alignment on brand
early identification of conduct risk
"" of training opportunities or other problems
more dynamic teams
iterative testing platform to facilitate extremely rapid response to
new conditions (pandemics)

Adopting a statistically driven model for the humans in your company means:

mix-and-match teams according to projects, not divisions
3rd party integration more seamless
no "tread in place" churn or stagnation within divisions

This also puts you in a great place to try OTHER radical changes, like
adopting different technologies (slack? zoom? twitch?) or processes (4
day work week? Unweeking? 100% remote? Flat hierarchy?) etc.
