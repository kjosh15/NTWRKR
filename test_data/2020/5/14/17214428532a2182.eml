If there's going to be Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6fra we'd want to arrive the day=
 before
and leave the day after, roughly. (2nd - 9th?)

I'd love to see what existing online platforms exist that we could either
emulate or leverage. I know there are teaching platforms, language coaching
platforms, pairing platforms for speakers and learners, etc. etc. At the
very least you'd want a system that supported ranking and best-in-class

with the teachers we have there to start with and as part of

 that we could either emulate or leverage. I know there are teaching platfo=

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to =
pick your brains. We have been looking at different ways of moving forward =
with Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar this summer. I think we will have plenty of =
Icelandic children and less children from abroad. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt; In a little brainstorming session with Alfrun my daughter about how we=
 can make sure Alexia gets better stimulated the idea came that we should d=
o regular zoom sessions with her. Following that I thought of an online lan=
guage school. We would start by developing this for Icelandic children livi=
ng abroad and if that works well we could possibly develop a tool for diffe=
rent nationalities. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before I run I wanted to =
ask you for an input and whether you could see this as a beginning of a sta=
rtup idea?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would love to hear your thoughts.=
 The initial steps will be to do a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon s=
chool through Skype. It would be done live so the children can interact wit=
h the app. 10 at the time and they will have a teacher or two that speaks t=
o them and guides them in the theme or method we use. We would centre this =
in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur and with the teachers we have there to start w=
ith and as part of Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But if the idea=
 has a bigger potential I would be interested in setting up a company with =
a couple of other people that would have complimentary skills to build this=
 on a bigger scale. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing=
 from you whether this is something that makes sense or whether I am away w=
ith the fairies ;) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>=
