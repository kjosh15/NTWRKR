&gt; I want to pick your brains. We have been looking at different ways of =
moving forward with Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar this summer. I think we will =
have plenty of Icelandic children and less children from abroad. <br>&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a little brainstorming session with Alfrun my daught=
er about how we can make sure Alexia gets better stimulated the idea came t=
hat we should do regular zoom sessions with her. Following that I thought o=
f an online language school. We would start by developing this for Icelandi=
c children living abroad and if that works well we could possibly develop a=
 tool for different nationalities. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before I r=

t;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would love to hear=
 your thoughts. The initial steps will be to do a Saturday morning or a Sun=
day afternoon school through Skype. It would be done live so the children c=
an interact with the app. 10 at the time and they will have a teacher or tw=
o that speaks to them and guides them in the theme or method we use. We wou=
ld centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur and with the teachers we have t=
here to start with and as part of Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. =
But if the idea has a bigger potential I would be interested in setting up =
a company with a couple of other people that would have complimentary skill=
s to build this on a bigger scale. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=
