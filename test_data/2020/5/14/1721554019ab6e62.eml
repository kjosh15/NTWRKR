How's it going Josh?

Are you still in the city, or did you evacuate for greener pastures?

Other than Pepin, we've all stayed around. TL is somehow remaining busy,
although we've also had some bad luck with large projects being pulled at
the last minute. Not surprising, but nonetheless suboptimal.

I'm checking in because, oddly enough, we've had lots of conversations with
corporates recently. Nothing has come out of it white yet, but it seems
that bigger companies are using this pandemic as a time to rethink their
offerings & their business. It might not be a bad time to start some
outreach, since ya never know what might come of it.

If you're up for it, I'd like to hop on a call to update you on what we've
been doing & discuss how we've been positioning ourselves. Let me know what
your schedule is like next Tues & Weds.

Best,
Casey
