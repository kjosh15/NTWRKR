Good to hear you're doing well. We're still in Queens, five blocks from the
epicenter of the epicenter. We've got tickets to Iceland in one months'
time, so assuming flights are still running that's when we'll be out. Lots
of interesting projects afoot, although nothing signed yet - this pandemic
has suddenly given me a chance to pursue more meaningful work (i.e.,
healthtec and related) which I'm really excited about.

Curious to hear how you like teaching for NYU, and more curious why/how
you're going to the UK! I thought everything was locked down to foreign
travel?

All best,
Josh
