Vikram,

I hope you're doing well! It seems like a long time ago that we spoke
about the pandemic blowing over quickly...

I'm writing in case Iceland is of interest to you; I'm a citizen, and
they're offering significant discounts for shoots in the country (25%
off taxes, among other things). They're also one of very few countries
with no new COVID cases and a very thorough testing-on-entry program
(launching next week), and I know a number of people in the film
industry there who can help facilitate whatever is needed. Finally,
I'm planning to head there mid-June. :)

Let me know if you can think of anything that could do well being shot
there and I'll happily provide introductions - or better yet, a series
I could host for you in-country!

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
