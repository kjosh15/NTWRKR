Hi Josh this is Margaret and probably the best email. I don=E2=80=99t know w=
ho Margaret Betts is=E2=80=A6

I just had PRP done on my left ankle from too much hiking. Other than that t=
hings have been pretty quiet for me. I=E2=80=99m still hanging out in quaran=
tine. Maybe in the fall I=E2=80=99ll go back to consulting a little bit but h=
opefully mostly hiking and having fun! It has been incredibly boring these l=
ast few months.=20

How the hell are you? How many kids are you up to now? Are you still going t=
o Iceland frequently? What are you doing for income? Will I ever get to visi=
t with you? It really is great to hear from you. Take care,

Margaret
