Hi Josh,<br>
I had a good look at New Lab. It looks really interesting and I have lots o=
f questions too.<br>
<br>
From what I understand it started as most incubators do as a real estate pl=
ay, and is well supported by local government in NYC.<br>
<br>
Where this really coincides with what I was thinking is on the type of inno=
vation they are focusing on=E2=80=A6that is really spot on.<br>
The biggest difference is that they rely on start-ups and entrepreneurs, wh=
ile I think many great innovators and scientists are more risk-averse (or i=
s this a European view?) and would need a home for a longer period, with mo=
re long term employment prospects.
 This is what I think is missing and where I=E2=80=99m stuck with the fundi=
ng model...<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
How did Takeda go?<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
