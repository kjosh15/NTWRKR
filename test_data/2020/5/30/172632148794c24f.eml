Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple,

On the Grid Service and Managed WordPress Hosting service there is no way
to update the MySQL version on the server.  Due to the shared nature of the
services, the MySQL version on the server can only be updated by the system
engineers.  At this time, there have been no announcements of a planned
update to the MySQL version n the Grid or Managed WordPress services.

If you have any further questions regarding your (mt) Media Temple
services, please feel free to contact us at any time.

Best regards,

James S.
