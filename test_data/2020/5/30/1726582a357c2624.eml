In NZ, a ton of our cyber security folks all worked from home - around 70%
I hear - and did so productively. The other side of the business - not so
much - but a bunch of technical types all managed to do software
development from home and loved it (lots of working on database and
productivity tools and collaborating with each other remotely).

Right now I work for the NZ Police (seconded for a year - up in October!).
I was tasked with setting up and running an open source team in Police
intel collections - and we've done that while also handling all the other
drama occurring here over the last 12 months. We were able to set up and
work from home quickly and efficiently, and Police accepted the small risks
involved. Arguably we're better set up now than before the pandemic - we're
back at the office but we have corporate and operational laptops and
accounts and we're able to work from home, or anywhere, at the drop of a
hat.

In fact, it seems to me like the open source contribution to the
all-of-government response and operations centres (a lot of unique alerting
was from my team, but others contributed sentiment and monitoring) was so
valued I'm seeing more interest from a range of agencies in setting up open
source cells in their organisations and there are some calls for people to
be collocated in a fusion centre even. Pretty hopeful I will be involved in
that!

analyst at DIA, I was selected to be part of the overnight team for DIA&#39=
;s participation in a Pacific Command military exercise. Lots of downtime a=
s we waited for something to happen. One of the bright, young China analyst=
s explained=C2=A0to me how he was five times better informed about what was=
 going on in China when he was at home vice in the SCIF at work. It spanned=
 several factors:<br>- Technology (he had high-end computers with multiple =
wrap-around monitors at his home desk, a government-issue lowest-bid PC wit=
h one monitor at work)<br>- Access (at home he had a hacker community-maint=
ained VPN he used to get around the Great Chinese Firewall to view sites as=
 if he was in China; while at work he had a feeble out-of-date VPN that eve=
n his supervisors thought was already compromised)<div>- Software (home set=
up included open source and purchased programs for monitoring social media,=
 visualizing data, doing rapid translations, etc.. while work had a few gov=
ernment licenses of aging software and multi-day turnaround times for trans=
lation)</div><div>- Crowd-sourcing (at home he was tied into a network of C=
hina watchers &amp; experts that spanned the globe while at work it was him=
 and a handful of other analysts in his office plus some at other agencies-=
-though he was discouraged from working with certain agencies...)</div><div=
><br></div><div>He was highly regarded by his leadership and being groomed =
for promotion but confided in me that he expected he&#39;d leave government=
 service in the next few years as he&#39;d concluded the thrill of access t=
o classified information didn&#39;t make up for how he felt his time was wa=
sted during much of the day and his fears that getting too comfortable in t=
he government analyst role would lead to him losing his edge and competitiv=
eness for a better-compensated analyst role in the financial sector. But it=
 was the quality of life challenges of the workplace that seemed to be driv=
ing him to an earlier departure. He&#39;d negotiated with his manager to ha=
ve a later start time (he was a night owl and stayed up late to have more o=
verlap with West Pacific time zones) but wasn&#39;t able to take full advan=
tage of it because the agency didn&#39;t have enough parking so he ended up=
 spending 30+ minutes circling for an open spot. He thought the food in the=
 building sucked and felt very disconnected from his social network due to =
not being able to access social media software during the workday (this was=
 pre-smartphones, though those would have been stashed in a locker). Still,=
 he had a high mission-focus and a strong sense of patriotic duty, and I be=
lieve the agency could have retained him if he had been able to work from h=
ome two days a week. Given the above, he probably would have been more prod=
uctive and able to provide more-informed analysis.<br><br>The tech company =
I am now made an early decision to go full-remote during the pandemic, and =
has been able to make the transition fairly painlessly. They haven&#39;t co=
mmitted to full-remote as a permanent option yet, but they are now consider=
ing it as a hiring option (was off the table before), which will open up ou=
r talent recruiting pool. The CEO has noted that meetings seem to work best=
 if they are all-present or all-remote, but the mixed format tends to make =
it difficult to fully include the subset of participants who are remote. My=
 biggest hangup about working from home full-time has been the difficulty o=
f setting boundaries with the family. With the kids home from school and my=
 wife working remote as well, we&#39;ve had a hard time finding ways to all=
ow us both to be productive while not just parking the boys in front of a s=
creen. But I recognize that is more related to the phase of life than a uni=
versal constraint.</div><div><br></div><div>My prediction is that the intel=
 community will outlast this crisis and find a way to return to its familia=
r way of working but that the taste of something different will open the ey=
es of a portion of its workforce and that retention will be even worse than=
 usual for the next year or so.</div><div><br></div><div>As for working sec=
urely in a remote manner, I think the financial sector has shown this is po=
ssible for awhile now. Financial planners and wealth advisors work from the=
 road and have access to tens/hundreds of millions of dollars of portfolio =
net worth. Traders and quants often work remote and the deals and infrastru=
cture they have access to are valued in the billions. What the intel commun=
ity has not had to confront yet is a sustained challenge to its accustomed =
ways of working (though the extended field deployments of the War on Terror=
 came closer than anything) so it is blind to the cost of its current metho=
ds. The entertainment industry is in the midst of this revolution in distri=
buted working (how many games wouldn&#39;t get made if you couldn&#39;t out=
source to Ukraine or Poland for development &amp; art, how many animated se=
ries only came to be because of cheap artistic talent in East Asia, etc..) =
and companies that can&#39;t keep up will be beat by others (early example =
was Pixar essentially taking over Disney Animation). Entertainment companie=
s will find a way to push projects forward with a distributed model whilst =
still avoiding leaks/spoilers or they will fall behind others who can. The =
history major part of me is looking forward to reading the books that will =
be written about how 2020 was an inflection point for many industries that =
caused widespread disruption and spurred rapid innovation--and was ultimate=
ly one of the contributors to the leading companies of the future that we h=
aven&#39;t even heard of yet.</div><div><br></div><div>Brad<br>SHARP &#39;0=
