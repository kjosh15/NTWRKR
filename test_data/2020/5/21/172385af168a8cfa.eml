Very cool. He sounds like he'd have the right perspective. The more I =
think about this the more it seems like the third pillar of crushing the =
virus via tracing. As Taiwan, Vietnam, Slovenia, etc show it is possible =
to drive infection rates down with aggressive track & trace.

The motivation to do this as a separate org is to provide trust through =
independence (e.g. Switzerland), avoid encumbering the card companies =
with HIPAA data, and allow greater scale through limited cooperation =
with competitors. More liability and customer trust than any specific =
technical requirement (though being a smaller org will allow more =
flexible recruiting as well).

There is a key functional addition to human tracing and the phone-based =
Bluetooth tracking: You could be exposed to someone else without seeing =
them just by visiting the same space after them. It's looking likely =
that infectious droplets can hang in the air for 30 minutes or more. So =
in addition to phone-based proximity and known close contacts this =
capability is the third pillar in finding contacts.

A big question in my mind is if a card company can move fairly quickly =
to cooperate on a prototype (decision process, regulatory, etc).

I've outlined some of the thinking here below, but I think the next move =
is to answer how to move forward with the first card company, and also a =
comms strategy for the other stakeholders (which you have insight on).

functional design
- users and businesses get timely alerts of potential exposure & risk
- no health or PII data is shared: AMEX never sees HIPAA data, NewCo =
never sees customer PII
- cardholders, businesses, AMEX, and other processors can cooperate for =
greater coverage

cardholder pitch
- protect yourself with alerts for places you frequent
- protect your family and community with alerts if you have potential =
exposure

branding
- health-conscious halo for retail businesses and AMEX

trust challenges:
- independence / blinding
- trust between competitors (data pooling)
- isolation from HIPAA data

stakeholders & integration points
- card transaction data & alerting infrastructure
- local businesses
- public health track & trace teams

technical infrastructure
- AMEX data bridge: consume transaction data
- cardholder portal: set alerting preferences, view risk events, =
register positive test
- business portal: alerting prefs, view risk events, send exposure event
- public health portal: alerting prefs, send exposure event, send call =
request (one way, no contact details exposed)
