t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to pick your brains. We h=
ave been looking at different ways of moving forward with Tungum=C3=A1lat=
=C3=B6frar this summer. I think we will have plenty of Icelandic children a=
nd less children from abroad. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a little bra=
instorming session with Alfrun my daughter about how we can make sure Alexi=
a gets better stimulated the idea came that we should do regular zoom sessi=
ons with her. Following that I thought of an online language school. We wou=
ld start by developing this for Icelandic children living abroad and if tha=
t works well we could possibly develop a tool for different nationalities. =
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before I run I wanted to ask you for an input=
 and whether you could see this as a beginning of a startup idea?<br>&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would love to hear your thoughts. The initial steps w=
ill be to do a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon school through Skype.=
 It would be done live so the children can interact with the app. 10 at the=
 time and they will have a teacher or two that speaks to them and guides th=
em in the theme or method we use. We would centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=
=C3=B0ur and with the teachers we have there to start with and as part of T=
ungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But if the idea has a bigger potent=
ial I would be interested in setting up a company with a couple of other pe=
ople that would have complimentary skills to build this on a bigger scale. =
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing from you whether th=
is is something that makes sense or whether I am away with the fairies ;) <=
