Choong,

I guess this question just got more urged. I teased up some interest from
Clayton F. Ruebensaal, EVP, Global B2B Marketing at American Express, and
asked him:

"Who should I talk to about connecting American Express with an AI Company
founder who just exited and has an idea for using purchasing data as an
analog for track-and-trace? Would love to see people look to their American
Express card as a source of ongoing safety!!"

He asked me to send him an email with more so he can figure out the right
person. Can you give me more so I can make the intro? Also, would love to
be a part of this if there's a way to add value!

All best,
Josh
