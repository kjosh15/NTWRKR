Depends on if I can get Abbot and/or Sutter Health interested. Abbott has
gone completely dark (which, given the recent press about their tests I can
understand) but I have a call with the CIO of Sutter next week. Idea is to
see if a consortium approach to setting up clinical trials of CGMs for
behavior change is supportable.

Visa is 10-15 days out from being confirmed. Will keep you posted.

What about yourself? Chose a new direction yet?
