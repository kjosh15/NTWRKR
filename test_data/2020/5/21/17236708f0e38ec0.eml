Hey Josh,

This is a huge issue and why we mentioned safety during our meeting. We are
aware the building has had issues with safety for the last few years. In
just our time here we have had multiple packages as well as 2 bikes stolen.
You can definitely report to 311 your broken door and the lack of response
to the repair by management. You may be able to report the sanitary/safety
issue however I am not 100% sure about that and you would need to ask the
operator.

I would suggest either calling or texting as when I tried to see if the
online system had your specific issue able to be documented, it isn't very
easy to navigate. I also find that texting works much better as the
operators generally are more knowledgeable. It also helps to keep a log of
the conversation.

I am including photos of the area of the app that said what you can report
for public area and building-wide complaints so you can refer to it when
you contact them. You can also make multiple reports at once. Last time I
made a report I made a public area report as well as a building-wide
report. If you let the operator know your issues they are usually pretty
good at covering all your bases.

It speeds the process up if you start your text with your building address,
say we are in a privately managed building, if you want to be anonymous
tell them, and then list the issues and say if they are a public area. They
will respond in minutes and can sort you through the process.

If you want to report apartment specific repairs you would need to give
your apartment number and that would then not be anonymous. However, as we
said in the meeting, if you plan to withhold rent for repairs, making 311
reports about those repairs helps support your case a lot if you need to
defend yourself in court, which would be highly likely. Also as you are a
top floor apartment, if you are having any leak issues and report that, the
HPD can inspect the roof which is badly needed.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Your Neighbors/ Hayes Court United
