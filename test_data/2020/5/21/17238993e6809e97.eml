Curious to get your thoughts on the IONChannel call yesterday. I&#39;d<br>
love to find a way to get this up and running!<br>
<br>
AFAIK, there should be some details available in whatever release<br>
notes the ECCMA/EMDB provide to paying customers, and/or we could get<br>
together a software inventory to monitor. That could be a scrub of<br>
open source (e.g. Apache server) software used internally (a la<br>
Equifax) or commercial packages.<br>
<br>
Who do you think I should push for one of the above, or do you think<br>
just waiting and scheduling another call is the next best bet?<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!!<br>
