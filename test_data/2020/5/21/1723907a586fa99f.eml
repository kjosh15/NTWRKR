Smari,

Thanks again for the invite to this! I made some notes about some topics to
hit, below. Feel free to add/remove as you see fit to maximize impact on
this audience - for example, we could double down just on tech innovation
outcomes, or talk more broadly about Icelandic political implications.

> The virus itself:

Decent chance it'll continue to flare up for another 3 years, or longer.
Could become like the flu, but deadlier.
Society should anticipate rolling shutdowns, quarantines, masks,
distancing, and surges for the foreseeable future.
It's not commonly explicit yet, but the question is how many lives for how
many dollars.

> Supply Chains

Most countries are receding and focusing on self-sufficiency as much as
possible.
Asia and the US are getting worse, not better, meaning a massive
reshuffling of global power

> Political upheaval

A lot depends on US presidential election, which could likely lead to armed
conflict
"Capitalism" as it used to exist is being radically rewritten; the
impossible has been proven to be possible after all

> Work

60% of Americans want to stay remote. For the foreseeable future remote =3D
staying alive.

> Equality

Young people are extremely screwed, and historic inequality could lead to
enormous reforms, good and bad
Women in particular are vulnerable, and childcare globally is likely to
continue to take a toll on them
white collar workers can stay safe. Blue collar workers can't.

> Technology

Massive restructuring of advancements and investment; the mall is dead,
robotics are hot, and medtech rules supreme
huge aggregation of power; Google, Amazon, Apple are land-grabbing data,
privacy, and influence

> Innovation

Customer adoption is off the charts for new, relevant tech
Sea-change technology is viable now in a way we haven't seen in our
lifetimes

As for a bio, how about:

"Josh started as a hacker in his parent's basement and ended up developing
technology strategy with leaders at the upper echelon of business,
government, and internet security. He's spoken at Davos, TED, and a long
list of events around the globe. Josh has written three books on the topic
of technology innovation, hosted three television series on same, and
currently acts on retainer to a variety of senior executives across the
Fortune 400. He advises startups and multinationals alike, and specializes
in translating technology insight into actionable strategy. His most recent
startup, IndigoMetrics.com provides statistical models of human behavior
and belief."

Happy to tweak that as needed to fit whatever will create the best impact -
I'm obviously happy to cite specific consulting work, a more global
approach (client lists, etc.), or

Finally, can you send me an invite with the call-in instructions? (Zoom,
Google Hangouts, FT, whatever.)

kv.,
Josh
