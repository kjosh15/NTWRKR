It just gets better and better. Here is the email I just sent to Reid and
Yiber. I=E2=80=99ll let you know when (if) we get notified and when (if) we=
 see it
get cleaned up.

Is there a safety issue here, and/or does this warrant a call to 311?

Thanks!

Yiber, welcome to the building!! Unfortunately it looks like the broken
door in the B line let someone in who walked all the way to the top of the
stairs where they defecated by the fire door. My kids found it as they were
playing on our way out.

I know it=E2=80=99s nearing the end of the day, but obviously this is a big=
 health
hazard - can you please let us know when you=E2=80=99ve got it cleaned up?

Reid, the door is, indeed, broken again. It=E2=80=99s going on five years n=
ow, but
having people wander in to use our apartment as a toilet is a pretty big
security/ safety issue, especially as there are currently no working
security cameras on premises. Can you please let us know when you expect to
get both of those issues resolved?

Thanks both,
Josh
