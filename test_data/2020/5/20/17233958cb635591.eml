t;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Josh and Hulda,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=
t;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hope you are=
 all well and safe. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br=
>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to pick your brain=
s. We have been looking at different ways of moving forward with Tungum=C3=
=A1lat=C3=B6frar this summer. I think we will have plenty of Icelandic chil=
dren and less children from abroad. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a litt=
le brainstorming session with Alfrun my daughter about how we can make sure=
 Alexia gets better stimulated the idea came that we should do regular zoom=
 sessions with her. Following that I thought of an online language school. =
We would start by developing this for Icelandic children living abroad and =
if that works well we could possibly develop a tool for different nationali=
ties. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before I run I wanted to ask you for an=
 input and whether you could see this as a beginning of a startup idea?<br>=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=
;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would love to hear your thoughts. The initial s=
teps will be to do a Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon school through =
Skype. It would be done live so the children can interact with the app. 10 =
at the time and they will have a teacher or two that speaks to them and gui=
des them in the theme or method we use. We would centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=
=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur and with the teachers we have there to start with and as pa=
rt of Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar to start with. But if the idea has a bigger=
 potential I would be interested in setting up a company with a couple of o=
ther people that would have complimentary skills to build this on a bigger =
scale. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;=
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing from you whe=
ther this is something that makes sense or whether I am away with the fairi=
es ;) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&=
