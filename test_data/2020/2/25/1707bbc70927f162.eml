That works =E2=80=93 in the interim I=E2=80=99ve done some thinking:

=20

*	Many different ways to play it but think the end game for Linkedin =
would to allow each user to have a =E2=80=9Csoft skills portable =
profile=E2=80=9D on their page
*	They have tried this with the =E2=80=9CSkills and =
Endorsements=E2=80=9D section, but this isn=E2=80=99t very effective as =
it is too exposed to gamified behaviour to be effective.
So could go down the route of explaining why what we do is not exposed =
to gamification, we decide who reviews who, we decide the question, the =
data is structured enough to isolate bias behaviours etc
*	Lifelong learning and a route to upskilling outsiders. They seem to be =
worried about linkedin perpetrating the exclusion of those without the =
correct qualifications.
So a soft skill portable learning profile would allow a route for =
individuals without the right hard qualifications to develop soft =
qualifications and break in to those roles normally restricted to those =
with the right CVs
https://on.ft.com/2T0gQlj
*	You could even go with the save the western world pitch. Once linkedin =
houses a workplace portable profile it would be a short(ish) step to =
creating a whole life portable profile, the ultimate tool to =
=E2=80=9Crealise our vision of creating economic opportunity for every =
member of the global workforce,=E2=80=9D
*	In terms of how to get to the portable profile, many ways to skin it =
but predictably I like an extension of what we are doing. They get some =
of their main corporate accounts to use it and provide a =
=E2=80=9Cshare=E2=80=9D button somewhere =E2=80=93 then wait for people =
to organically start to share their profiles. Then you start building in =
cross workplace reviews =E2=80=93 ie selectively asking individuals to =
review others that we know they know, but work for different =
organisations (obvs need to be careful with gamification here =E2=80=93 =
but I reckon I know how to do that)
*	Why should they get us involved, if they like the idea why not develop =
it themselves. How do we worry them that competition is coming fast and =
that they need to save 12 months by CVCing us? You=E2=80=99ll be better =
than me at this =E2=80=93 but maybe the big workplace software guys =
could take linkedin=E2=80=99s central position (and reason for being) =
before they know it. Imagine if salesforce or workday started doing =
portable profiles and ultimately created an offshoot to house those =
profiles =E2=80=93 suddenly linkedin loses its monopoly as the only =
provider of professional networking and identity backgrounds=20

Good points, and agreed across the board. Guess we get to figure this =
out quickly as he wants to talk Wednesday. I know you're nominally on =
vacation; did you want to break silence on Monday, and/or did you have =
any further thoughts we could exchange via email?

That=E2=80=99s an awesome intro to Linkedin =E2=80=93 we should be able =

Its funny =E2=80=93 I took a look at Glint and my first reaction is the =
same as CultureAmp =E2=80=93 but then after a while =3D I think this is =
just data as noise. Because it is quite difficult to use these apps for =
the approach of =E2=80=93 first define what I want my culture to look =
like =E2=80=93 and bearing in mind that usually includes particular =
language and tone of voice, then how do I make that culture happen? I =
don=E2=80=99t see how Glint directly helps you with that =E2=80=93 its =
all too generic.

So yes =E2=80=93 I agree =E2=80=93 we need to revisit the pitch and do a =
better job of explaining why we are actually suggesting something way =
cooler that Glint =E2=80=93 I feel I know it, but cant explain it very =
well!

Just spoke to a contact at LinkedIn; he's going to introduce me to their =
team in business development as well as someone who did a big project =
there around purpose driven organizations. I'm working on how to present =
Indigo as distinct from our competitors, but in the meantime he brought =
up https://www.glintinc.com/ which is worth another look - they've =
really expanded their service offerings, how they describe their impact, =
the portfolio of features, etc. This is what we're competing with, and a =
LOT of it is just language. I think we could update both our decks and =
our site if we wanted to invest in the marketing effort... but am =
equally concerned about what we're losing if we don't. Thoughts?
