I'm pretty sure that once my kids are bigger I'll be able to track the
random calling of interesting folks, but at the moment I'm just terrible at
it. Apologies!

Separately, I was curious how your series pitch has been going, and what
you thought of the treatment I sent. I'm really keen to get an OTT approach
for this!

All best,
Josh

P.S. Spoke to Rachel and she said she owed you a note. So, there's that.
