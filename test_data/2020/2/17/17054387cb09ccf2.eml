Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple.

I understand you would like to potentially move email from GoDaddy to your (mt) Media Temple account. Unfortunately, there is not a standard method for migrating emails from one provider to another. However, the simplest method is outlined in the following steps:

- Create your email users on the new server. If possible, try to give them the same passwords they had on the original server.

For additional information regarding creating an email account, please review the following Knowledge Base article:

Creating an email account
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204643680/creating-removing-an-email-account

- Configure both accounts within your email client, using the IMAP protocol. Use the IP address or Access Domain as the incoming and outgoing servers.

-Drag and drop mail from the old server to the new server

For expanded instructions, please see this Knowledge Base article:

IMAP Email Migration
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204405444/how-do-i-migrate-email-between-servers-using-imap
