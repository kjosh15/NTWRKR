Chris,

Here's a couple of the better overviews of the SOC2 process:

https://www.scmagazine.com/home/opinion/how-we-got-soc-2-certified-in-less-=
than-6-months-and-how-you-can-too/

and

https://blog.sqreen.com/soc-2-compliance-guide-for-startups/

Here's an example of the kinds of materials that are available:

https://www.strongdm.com/soc-2-ebook-download-2/?hsCtaTracking=3De007167f-e=
9c9-4939-a7f8-4a9ca39118d2%7C93a801b1-0c77-4b3a-9859-4c8f426e3c16

I.e., there are plenty of platforms, services, and providers out there
willing to take your money in exchange for walking you through this.

Big takeaway is that doing this early in the company's lifespan is easier
than later, esp. as there are so many fewer moving pieces to have to mess
with. Downside is it's likely to be expensive (we need a big 4 company to
do an audit) and time consuming (at least 6 months).

Also note that Misha (at Bechtel) indicated that he'd want to see us comply
with their internally-defined Level 3 data classification. It may well be
that we can borrow from SOC2 documentation to produce whatever Bechtel
needs without having to get a full audit, etc. In that case our small size
might expedite quite a bit.

I've got requests out to a number of friends to see what we can lift/borrow
in terms of processes, procedures, and docs to give us a leg up. If we can
satisfy Misha without having to get full SOC2 compliance I'd consider it a
huge win. (Esp. noting that the primary value to having SOC2 certification
is customer confidence, vs. any regulated requirements, and that having a
big-name customer wins us similar.)
