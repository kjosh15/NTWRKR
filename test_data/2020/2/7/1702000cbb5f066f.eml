Dawn,

Thanks again for meeting yesterday. I'm enormously grateful for the time
and attention and can't overstate how much I appreciate your perspective.
You've definitely got a uniquely valuable view of the NY Tech Scene!!

I'll bring you up in my next call w/ World 50, but wanted to gauge your
interest in working with senior leaders to tour them around different
aspects of the NYC tech Ecosystem. Is this something that you're keen to
monetize, is it a nice bonus from a networking perspective, or is it more
of a favor to me?

Secondly, you'd mentioned a couple people I was curious about:

1. Catherine at Bloomberg. You'd suggested she has a ton of info about
smart cities (they issue reports). If it may be useful for her to
collaborate with my executive contacts I'd love to connect with her.

2. Matt at Grand Central Tech sounds like a super interesting contact, both
on the psychometrics side and the Commercial Real Estate (microtargeting)
approach. Do you think he'd be willing to connect?

I'll check out Flatiron Health and First Round's healthcare work in the
meantime. I'm curious to see what comes next, and as ever please do let me
know if I can ever be of help. As you suggested, I'm here for you! :)

All best,
Josh
