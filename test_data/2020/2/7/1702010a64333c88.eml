Without going too deep into it, while I have some reservations about some
her analysis, I think overall it emphasizes the point I've been trying to
make for 3 years - in order to be victorious, we MUST go after the Trump
base. And yes, I also do think there's room for inflaming sentiment on the
left to help juice turnout.

This is the real shit that most on the left and in the media don't want to
acknowledge, but that the Trump team has been running wild with since 2014.
