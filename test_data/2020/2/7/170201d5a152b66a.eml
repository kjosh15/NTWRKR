David has a FT job again and is stepping out of his work with Tovo in the
near term due to health problems. Good news is he's willing to be a senior
advisor to anything we do, and more importantly he knows some very good
engineers on the ad side who can execute everything he has described.
Specifically, if we want to demonstrate microtargeting we'd need an
engineer who understands how it works to help us execute. He's introduce me
to one and we'll be speaking hopefully next week.

If i can get clear, cogent, well-priced answers on how we'd do a demo we
can proceed to that as a next step. It occurs to me that if we're going to
spend the $$ to do it anyway, we may as well try it on a prospective
client. Thoughts?
