Richard, Tom, Jon,

Apologies for vanishing mid-call earlier; good news is my furniture
survived and the roof is going to get fixed. Bad news is we had to hang up
before I could get to my questions, which are many!

Let me know when you're available to reschedule - really excited to pick up
where we left off and see how it correlates, both to the psychometric work
I've been doing and potentially with the financial clients I could connect
with. Would afternoon EST Wednesday Feb 12th work?

Sincerely,
Josh
