=E2=80=9COver the past few decades, American politics has become like a bit=
ter
sports rivalry, in which the parties hang together mainly out of sheer
hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose.
Republicans might not love the president, but they absolutely loathe his
Democratic adversaries. And it=E2=80=99s also true of Democrats, who might =
be
consumed by their internal feuds over foreign policy and the proper role of
government were it not for Trump.=E2=80=9D

Super interesting idea that it's not about swing voters, but about who
hates who most. If that's the case, then (as sad as it sounds) shouldn't it
be possible to activate the left by making them hate trump more? And,
conversely, to disable the right by making trumpsters think of democrats as
actually not so bad?
