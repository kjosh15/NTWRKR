He's pushed back the date again (this is very common with Carl, and senior
execs in general, I'm afraid) but I'm hoping to get in front of him by the
end of the month. Anything you have about the pitches you're pushing there
would be helpful.

Similarly, if you have whitepapers or other high-level overviews of your
current initiatives I'd love to read them so I'm able to speak to them when
I'm engaged with my other senior clients. Let me know!

best,
Josh
