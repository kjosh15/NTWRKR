Wanted to follow up on the final payment; you guys were very timely on the
last one and was wondering if we'd be able to close this out shortly.

Hope you guys are doing well; I'm due to drop in to connect with Greg about
IDEO lunches with some of the business communities I'm attached to next
week - hope to get to say hi then!

All best,
Josh
