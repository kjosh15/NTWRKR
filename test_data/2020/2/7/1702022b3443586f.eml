Thanks again for meeting yesterday; it was great to catch up and especially
meaningful to talk to someone with such a deep understanding of the state
of play of (dis)information online - and a strong interest in doing
something about it.

I'll check out the listings for Microsoft, esp. Microsoft NYC, and if for
some reason something pops out will let you know. Otherwise, please do keep
me in mind if you need another pair of hands or have an opportunity for
someone to help push on the efforts you have in play - I fully agree with
you that now is the time for serious efforts to improve how/where/what
technology plays a role in our lives!!

All best wishes,
Josh
