Just learned about your retirement - congratulations! Let me know if
there's a personal email to keep in touch with after your departure, and/or
if there's anyone to connect with at HP about their R&D work.

Above all, thanks for the insights and good conversations; if you come
through NYC I'd always be glad to grab a coffee and catch up.

All best,
Josh
