David,

I wanted to aggregate the opportunities for Tovo's technology and process
that we've been kicking around so far. My goal is to centralize the content
we'd need to get a deal off the ground, avoid chasing opps we don't want,
and make (limited) solid plans to maximize our chances. Here are the opps I
know about:

# Politics

1. I have a contact who is trying to get us connected to Biden.
2. Ayesha Khan (former Pakistani movie star, then big-time NYC Real Estate
broker) says she can get us plenty of funding for a PAC that is solely
focused on eroding Trump's base.
3. CAA can get us an intro to Cardi B if/when we produce a document to send
to them.

# Microtargeting

4. I have a contact exploring an intro to a major contact at Zell Real
Estate in Chicago
5. Aaron of Venture.co may want to use a microtargeting approach to sell
it's own products
6. Chris in London has a couple contacts that are curious to see a more
formal pitch, including one in real estate and another in finance.

Questions:

A) For the first group, I think a PAC approach is the most solid, followed
by a one-pager for Cardi B. Do you agree? If so, what is required to make a
PAC, and what does the potential profit look like?

B) For the second group, the feedback I get again and again is that
potential clients want proof that it works. My business partners at Indigo
may be willing to pay a small fee ($1-2k) to buy the data, aggregate the
content, and push the ad buys. Is that enough to demonstrate capability?

C) I sent you an email titled "Another target for Tovo" about Venture.co;
let me know if you think they'd be a good potential client.

D) You sent me an email titled "Culture play" on Jan 20, 2020, 3:23 PM: you
were going to make a quick deck we could send to Cardi B. What's the status
on this?

All best,
Josh
