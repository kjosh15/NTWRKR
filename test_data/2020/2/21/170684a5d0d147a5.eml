I would be happy to chat. I may not be of immediate or obvious =
assistance as I quit my job at Generali, for reasons exactly like your =
resolution. We returned to Canada in the summer, and I am working on =
what=E2=80=99s next. <br class=3D"">

So, prioritize me as you see fit, knowing I may not be your highest =

I'm writing as one of my new year's resolutions is to work more with =
people I admire, and not at all with assholes. The latter is pretty =
straightforward to implement, with the pleasant side effect that I have =
more time for the former...<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
I wanted to set a time for a short call in the coming weeks to see =
how/if we can help each other this year. I'm spending increasing time =
coaching high value talent on innovation strategy and new tech, doing =
direct advising on same to both startups and executive boards, and of =
course have a few fun projects running on the side (a psychometrics SaaS =
platform measuring culture, an IoT Wellness lab, and an AI for =
networking project among others!)<br class=3D"">

Let me know if you have a half hour to talk and tell me what you're =
building in 2019!<br class=3D"">
