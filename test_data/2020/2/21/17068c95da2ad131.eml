&gt;&gt; Thanks for this! I can already think of a few people to pass this =
to. Can you follow up with an email contextualizing this for small, medium,=
 and large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and some with the=
 former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is a new target f=

The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterprise with a lar=
ge supplier network - is third party risk management: How do I get a basic =
level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise, particularly =
from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a continuos basis.=
 As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green today might be red 90=
 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app that your web agency devel=
oped? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some venture-backed startup (=
none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about security). <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt=
;&gt; How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliverables (and t=
heir updates) developed outside your boundary?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How =
do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so that suppliers are on t=
he hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabilities emerge?<br>&gt;&gt;=
<br>&gt;&gt; How does this become a tractable process for procurement and v=
endor management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber forensics that =
they=E2=80=99re not staffed to take on? <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This is al=
so about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and meeting regul=
atory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as known-vulnerability ter=
ms of cyber insurance policies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; An example:<br>&gt=
;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services app deve=
lopment or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Governanc=
e criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibited comp=
onents lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your product (contai=
ning malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell that prod=
uct to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One of the=
 big banks requires an SBOM for full pricing - any product without an SBOM =
is subject to a 40% discount if it gets procured at all.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt=
;&gt; 2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to what=
ever the supplier is doing for assurance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3) If the=
 deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical vulnerability), tha=
t change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - security SLAs - can specify=
 how many hours/days the supplier has to push an update that remediates the=
 vulnerability, and see the time stamp with third party certification that =
the supplier has met the provision or not, in which case there might be rem=
edies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Does this make sens=
