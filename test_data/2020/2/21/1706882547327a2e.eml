Totally offer it to Deana. She has far more leverage than I do.  Should I
set an intro meeting? Phone conference?

r large enterprises - and any enterprise with a large supplier network - is=
 third party risk management: How do I get a basic level of assurance on th=
e software coming into my enterprise, particularly from outsourced/pro-serv=
ices teams and small vendors, on a continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a=

fed to take on? <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This is also about pushing risk to=
 the left in contract provisions, and meeting regulatory mandates for cyber=
 responsiveness, as well as known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance po=
licies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; An example:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) The=
 supplier deliverable (either pro services app development or vendor produc=
t SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Governance criteria are enforced.=
 For instance, the large banks have prohibited components lists - if you ha=
ve certain Python libraries in your product (containing malware, per threat=
 intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell that product to JP Morgan Chase -=
 it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One of the big banks requires an S=
BOM for full pricing - any product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% disc=
ount if it gets procured at all.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2) Ion Channel run=
s analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to whatever the supplier is doi=
ng for assurance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3) If the deliverable moves from =
green to red (e.g. new critical vulnerability), that change is time-stamped=
. Contract provisions - security SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the=
