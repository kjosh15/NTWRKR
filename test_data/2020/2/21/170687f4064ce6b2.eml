;&gt; The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterprise with=
 a large supplier network - is third party risk management: How do I get a =
basic level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise, particu=
larly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a continuos =
basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green today might be =

rtup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about security). <br>&gt;&gt;<=
br>&gt;&gt; How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliverables =

 that they=E2=80=99re not staffed to take on? <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This=
 is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and meeting=
 regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as known-vulnerabili=
ty terms of cyber insurance policies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; An example:<=
br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services ap=
p development or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Gov=
ernance criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibite=
d components lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your product (=
containing malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell tha=

If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical vulnerability=
