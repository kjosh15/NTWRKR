Hi Josh,

Working through your questions below. BTW, as I'm doing all this research
how will we work together?  Will I be a part of the program for Blackrock
and others or are you looking for research only?

Thanks,

ARkady

              It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retargeting. Th=
e only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and limited =
number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximize the =
probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. The spen=
d on each campaign will be below $1.

             But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no guarantee=
 the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a small num=
ber of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minimize th=
e listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impressions=
.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

             The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not guarante=
ed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a branding DSP =
campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the strategy=
 below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business we're t=
argeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&nbsp;

       IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at a cer=
tain time, but if that happens to be an office building with several thousa=
nd people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enough to=
 be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that correct=

             I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting platform=

o set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a secret mark=
eting mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on the open=
 web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individuals you n=
eed to target and creatives and then they will start to score their engagem=
ent with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as follows bu=
t based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability of reach=
ing everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your pool the mo=
re you can reach:&nbsp;

       They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for, bu=
t it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 impress=
ions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course of =
a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their con=
fidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it?

                          Arkady,
                          <br>
                          <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to hea=
r your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers. Here=
's the use case we want to try to prove:
                          <br>
                          <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an offic=
e), email address, and phone
                          <br>- We can get the target to click on a link
                          <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, either f=
or cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                          <br>
                          <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd like t=
o see evidence of:
                          <br>
                          <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a two =
week timespan
                          <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie after a=
 certain period of time
                          <br>- any additional tracking data on the target
                          <br>
                          <br>This would likely be deployed in the US or UK=
. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for $1-=
2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a client t=
o partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end plea=
se do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost savi=
ngs, benefits of scale, etc.
                          <br>
                          <br>Thanks so much!
                          <br>Josh
