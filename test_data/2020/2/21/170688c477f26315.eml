That=E2=80=99s an awesome intro to Linkedin =E2=80=93 we should be able =

repository of =E2=80=9Cworkplace values scores=E2=80=9D including =
portable profiles that would give them a position that nobody else has. =
I guess they would need to start with a company that has lots of staff =
on Linkedin and would be happy to co=3Doperate.

Its funny =E2=80=93 I took a look at Glint and my first reaction is the =
same as CultureAmp =E2=80=93 but then after a while =3D I think this is =
just data as noise. Because it is quite difficult to use these apps for =
the approach of =E2=80=93 first define what I want my culture to look =
like =E2=80=93 and bearing in mind that usually includes particular =
language and tone of voice, then how do I make that culture happen? I =
don=E2=80=99t see how Glint directly helps you with that =E2=80=93 its =
all too generic.

So yes =E2=80=93 I agree =E2=80=93 we need to revisit the pitch and do a =

Just spoke to a contact at LinkedIn; he's going to introduce me to their =
team in business development as well as someone who did a big project =
there around purpose driven organizations. I'm working on how to present =
Indigo as distinct from our competitors, but in the meantime he brought =
up https://www.glintinc.com/ which is worth another look - they've =
really expanded their service offerings, how they describe their impact, =
the portfolio of features, etc. This is what we're competing with, and a =
LOT of it is just language. I think we could update both our decks and =
our site if we wanted to invest in the marketing effort... but am =
equally concerned about what we're losing if we don't. Thoughts?
