Happy new year!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m writing as one of my new year&#39;s resolutions is to work more wit=

ghtforward to implement, with the pleasant side effect that I have more tim=

<br>
I wanted to set a time for a short call in the coming weeks to see how/if w=
e can help each other this year. I&#39;m spending increasing time coaching =
high value talent on innovation strategy and new tech, doing direct advisin=
