We'd want to contract you directly for execution, and if it leads to a

The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and limite=
d number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximize th=
e probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. The sp=
end on each campaign will be below $1.

         What is a $200 CPM, and how would that result in spending less tha=
n $1.00 for an entire campaign?

               But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no guarant=
ee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a small n=
umber of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minimize =
the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impressio=
ns.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

         What are average listening costs? If the ROI on getting the right =

               The biggest challenge is scaling.&nbsp; Someone should be pl=

               The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not guaran=
teed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a branding DS=
P campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the strate=
gy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business we're=
 targeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&nbsp;

         IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at a c=

sand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enough =
to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that corre=

               I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting platfo=

 to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a secret ma=
rketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on the op=
en web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individuals you=
 need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their engag=
ement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as follows =
but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability of rea=
ching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your pool the =
more you can reach:&nbsp;

         They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for, =
but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 impre=
ssions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course o=
f a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their c=
onfidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it?

                            Arkady,
                            <br>
                            <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to h=
ear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers. He=
re's the use case we want to try to prove:
                            <br>
                            <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an off=
ice), email address, and phone
                            <br>- We can get the target to click on a link
                            <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, either=
 for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                            <br>
                            <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd like=
 to see evidence of:
                            <br>
                            <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a tw=
o week timespan
                            <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie after=
 a certain period of time
                            <br>- any additional tracking data on the targe=
t
                            <br>
                            <br>This would likely be deployed in the US or =
UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for $=
1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a client=
 to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end pl=
ease do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost sa=
vings, benefits of scale, etc.
                            <br>
                            <br>Thanks so much!
                            <br>Josh
