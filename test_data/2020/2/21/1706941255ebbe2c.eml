Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DSP side.  I
would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP side to try this
methodolgy and see what the results are, since it's not proven.  I would
put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're proven with big clients
and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.

Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with my DSP, I'm
not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can leverage extra
account management as needed as long as there's some decent spend happening
on the DSP at least $3K per campaign per month.

I can make pixels on my platform at no cost, again because of my
relationship and monthly spend already with existing clients.

That's correct.  Finding a needle in a haystack (commercial building) will
be very difficult, thats why we typically to Lat Long and Day parting to
reach a certain "audience" at a certain location but not necessarily
particular people.  Again, it's not tested on specific people using DSP's
and I'm not sure if it will 100% as effective and trackable as Influ2.

Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.  So if it's 100 people
it's about $300.  He did mention that you need more scale at atleast 1-2000
people for it would affect a larger percentage.   So out of 100 people, we
may not affect all of them.  Can you get a bigger list?  If not, I can see
if we can focus on the list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of
concept.

               It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retargeting. T=
he only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and limited=
 number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximize the=
 probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. The spe=
nd on each campaign will be below $1.

     Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DSP side.&n=
bsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP side to try =
this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not proven.&n=

big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&nbsp; &nbsp;

              But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no guarante=
e the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a small nu=
mber of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minimize t=
he listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impression=
s.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

     Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with my DSP, =
I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can leverage extra=
 account management as needed as long as there's some decent spend happenin=

              The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not guarant=
eed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a branding DSP=
 campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the strateg=
y below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business we're =
targeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&nbsp;

        IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at a ce=
rtain time, but if that happens to be an office building with several thous=
and people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enough t=
o be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that correc=

need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their engage=

        They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for, b=
ut it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 impres=
sions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course of=
 a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their co=

     Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So if it's 10=
0 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more scale at =
atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage.&nbsp; &=
nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Can you get=
 a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the list of 100 =

                           Arkady,
                           <br>
                           <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to he=
ar your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers. Her=
e's the use case we want to try to prove:
                           <br>
                           <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an offi=
ce), email address, and phone
                           <br>- We can get the target to click on a link
                           <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, either =
for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                           <br>
                           <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd like =
to see evidence of:
                           <br>
                           <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a two=
 week timespan
                           <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie after =
a certain period of time
                           <br>- any additional tracking data on the target
                           <br>
                           <br>This would likely be deployed in the US or U=
K. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for $1=
-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a client =
to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end ple=
ase do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost sav=
ings, benefits of scale, etc.
                           <br>
                           <br>Thanks so much!
                           <br>Josh
