Sounds good. Would 8am EST Monday work for you?

Reg. the link, I just need a legitimate link from Discovery - if that=E2=80=
=99s a
stub page or a list with a link to the box.com page that works fine. Do you
have a master list of all your shows, or is the box.com link branded?

All best,
Josh

</div>
<div>I LOVE this!! The=C2=A0game design / reality tv approach is genius, al=

al impact programs right now.=C2=A0</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For example, Estonia developed an app to gamify picking up litter in t=
heir forests, and transformed both the countryside and civic engagement. Po=
kemon=C2=A0Go (I know the lead developers) was used to spin off exercise pr=
ograms for obesity fighting campaigns
 in the midwest. Carma Carpooling helps you find nearby people to share you=
r commute to reduce traffic and emissions. Dropcountr enables you to conser=
ve water by connecting you to your water utility company via your smartphon=
e. Farmstand helps you discover
 locally grown food from more than 8,700 farmers markets.=C2=A0Just google =
&quot;IOS games for environmental impact&quot; and you can find plenty of a=
pps which gamified specific environmental initiatives well above and beyond=
 straight &quot;edutainment.&quot;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Fundamentally, I think you&#39;ve got all the right elements, but if y=
ou take a different &quot;campaign&quot; each episode from a large corporat=
e sponsor you could a) fund the winning team, b) get additional investment =
for production, c) increase media footprint for

<div>It will air again. Will make sure you know when.</div>
<div>Let me know when I can call you to pick up on our discussion.</div>
<div>To your convenience.</div>
