I was thinking along the same lines.  Let's get a proof of concept in place
and make sure it all/we all work together smoothly and the rest will fall

Working on the answers.

                  It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retargeting=
. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and limi=
ted number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximize =
the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. The =
spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                 But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no guara=
ntee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a small=
 number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minimiz=
e the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impress=
ions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

           What are average listening costs? If the ROI on getting the righ=

                 The biggest challenge is scaling.&nbsp; Someone should be =

                 The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not guar=
anteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a branding =
DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the stra=
tegy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business we'=
re targeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&nbsp;

           IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at a=
 certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with several th=
ousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enoug=
h to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that cor=

                 I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting plat=
form from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brands in the US =
doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to move to the =
US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a secret =
marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on the =
open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individuals y=
ou need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their eng=
agement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as follow=
s but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability of r=
eaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your pool th=
e more you can reach:&nbsp;

           They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for=
, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 imp=
ressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course=
 of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their=
 confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it?

                              Arkady,
                              <br>
                              <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to=
 hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers. =
Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                              <br>
                              <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an o=
ffice), email address, and phone
                              <br>- We can get the target to click on a lin=
k
                              <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, eith=
er for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                              <br>
                              <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd li=
ke to see evidence of:
                              <br>
                              <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a =
two week timespan
                              <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie aft=
er a certain period of time
                              <br>- any additional tracking data on the tar=
get
                              <br>
                              <br>This would likely be deployed in the US o=
r UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for=
 $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a clie=
nt to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end =
please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost =
savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                              <br>
                              <br>Thanks so much!
