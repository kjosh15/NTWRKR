Subject: Several

=20

Chris,

A few things (and yes, I know I owe you a ton of email responses =
separate from this!):

1) Peppercomm

The meeting today went well; they have a "purpose stress test" in which =
they take the results of another agency's purpose analysis and do a =
bunch of surveying to see if the customer can actually execute on that =
purpose. They're interested in Indigo as a way to extend that and =
measure purpose alignment ongoing.=20

One takeaway was that they liked that the qualitative data created a =
feedback loop that automatically improved alignment, but they asked =
specifically for case studies (this could be as simple as one paragraph =
of outcomes per customer) and pricing. I gave the usual response that we =
were specifically interested in purpose as a driver, so may be willing =
to accommodate slightly on this. I'll loop back with my friend who got =
us the invite and see where pricing might land best - can you pull =
together some updated case studies, focused on outcomes? For context, =
they're currently working with a client that's forcing them to use =
Towers Watson, and hate it.

2) Big Spaceship=20

I have a meeting next week; they may want to whitelabel Indigo for =
innovation tracking/inculcation. I've been thinking for a while that we =
need a brand revamp - do you think it's worth suggesting an exchange to =
them? I.e., use it for free (i.e. keep all the profit) for 6 months in =
exchange for the marketing collatoral?

3) Nikole

Spoke again with my friend on the west coast who has been doing L&D at =
AirBnB. She's building our her own consultancy focused on offsites, but =
had a TON of language about the platform that we just don't own yet. =
Stuff around performance management (absolutely not us), where/how HR =
leaders are more willing to work with CEO's on culture development, and =
how and when to differentiate the platform. Out of everyone I've spoken =
to she's been the most on-point for understanding what we do relative to =
the competition along with how our clients may/may not respond to it.=20

We've known each other a long time, and there may be a chance for her to =
whitelabel the platform just for herself in exchange for helping us =
develop our marketing material and language to distinguish ourselves. =
She was very clear that the space we're in is glutted with shitty =
competitors - I think we've managed to miss a lot of that because we're =
coming in at a more senior level, but suspect it may be a big part of =
why/how we're not closing: because as Indigo goes down the vetting =
pipeline folks who have seen dozens of similar things don't notice the =
difference and write it off.=20

Alternately, it also might be worth hiring her for a brief consult on =
how to articulate our value prop (she's trained as an exec coach so I'm =
pretty sure we'd get value from a short interview or two)

Thoughts?
- J
