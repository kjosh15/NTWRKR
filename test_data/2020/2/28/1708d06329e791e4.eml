Excellent - this is great work across the board. I hear you about
incentives also, and it sounds like we could build a really solid
partnership here. Let's start with first steps, though: on Tuesday I'm
having lunch with the head of real estate at BlackRock and am looking to
validate a pilot. We need to have a proposal with costs, expected outcomes,
areas of uncertainty, and a deployment process (i.e., how and where we do
what with whom) for a stage 1 and stage 2 pilot, along with some thinking
about how and what we would need to then grow at scale. If we can identify
the 2-3 areas we're looking to validate that would be especially helpful.

Arkady, I know we've leaned on you a bunch already, but you're definitely
the most qualified to pull this together. Can you create a one-pager of the
above by monday so we can do a briefing call before my meeting?
