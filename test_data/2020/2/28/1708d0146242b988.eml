Just talked to Scott, the founder and an old friend. He's talking to Pony
Ma (Tencent's founder) about taking investment and partnering with them to
transform education in soft skills using their content, but needs a
platform for measuring efficacy at scale. He loves Indigo, loves what it
can do, but is currently leaving an advisory position to focus on TAI and
taking a couple weeks off with his wife in the middle of it.

Long story short he'd love to work together but it'll be a little while.
That said, if all goes well on his end he could potentially use our
platform to deploy educating China in soft skills.

Obviously all caveats apply, but if it happens that's worth a fucking ton
of tecquila, my friend. ;)
