As per our txt convo yesterday, the high-level best practices are:

    Make sure you have a supply of daily prescription medication on hand,
as well as over-the-counter fever reducers.
    Have sufficient nonperishable foods to last your family for two weeks.
    Have soup, crackers, and Gatorade or Pedialyte on hand should anyone in
the house get sick.
    Clean surfaces frequently with soap and water.
    Wear a mask if you get sick.
    Telecommute instead of going to an office, if possible.
    Have a plan in place for kids and older family members.
    Wash hands as soon as you enter your home.
    Cough into your elbow.

xoxo!
Josh
