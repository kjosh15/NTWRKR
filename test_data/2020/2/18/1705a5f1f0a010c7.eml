Katie,

Thanks again for meeting the other day! I did indeed take a look at the
jobs posted for Microsoft in NYC, but while I found a couple that looked
interesting:

https://careers.microsoft.com/professionals/us/en/job/786890/Strategic-Account-Executive
https://careers.microsoft.com/professionals/us/en/job/730201/Senior-Researcher

I don't think they'd afford me the variety of work that would make best use
of my background. Again, thanks so much for pointing me in the right
direction here!

On an entirely separate note, I'm developing a tv documentary series around
how innovation happens in very different places for very different reasons
all over the world, and am looking for a large corporate partner to be the
primary brand behind it. I know it's a long shot, but do you happen to know
anyone at Microsoft that might be able to talk to me about this?

Hope you're well,
Josh
