Just re-read this in more detail and it feels super on point for the kinds
of concerns I'm hearing from my executive contacts. I.e., broad, sweeping
culture change is requested with little infrastructure in place to support
it. Do you think we could make some case studies for how Indigo supported
companies in three different verticals in making a culture change (to
emphasize that our platform supports whatever kind of change is required)
semi-automatically?

Also, what's status on the short video case studies?
