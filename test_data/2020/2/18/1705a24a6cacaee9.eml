Took a quick look, and at the outset I'd say you're definitely starting in
the right place! I'm a little concerned about how this will get you where
you want to go, however. There are innumerable programs that could fit the
scope, and plenty of frameworks that could suggest themselves as being
useful to the B Team.

If I could make any change here it would be to emphasize delivery of a
framework tailored to the past successes of the B Team (to increase
validation) as substantiated by current best-in-class industry examples
aligned to a prespecified set of potential directives for exploration by
the B Team.

That way you don't end up with an immediately out-of-date document full of
examples that may or may not be useful two weeks later, but rather a
framework for thinking about the kinds of activity currently getting the
most traction along with a discreet list of points of overlap where the B
Team could plot a trajectory.

This is really exciting stuff. What is the potential for this to turn into
more work in this space with the B Team in future?

Best wishes,
Josh
