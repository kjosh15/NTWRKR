Thanks so much, Parastou! To bcc to save your inbox.

Bill, would love to connect if you have time for a quick call or a coffee
(if in NYC); I've been doing a bunch of work in an adjacent space and would
be really curious to see if/where there's overlap. Let me know what your
schedule looks like in the next couple weeks if you're available!

best,
Josh
