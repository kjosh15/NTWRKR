                           Thanks for this! I can already think of a few pe=

for small, medium, and large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter=
 and some with the former, and not as often with the midsize (although&nbsp=

                         The difficult problem for large enterprises - and =
any enterprise with a large supplier network - is third party risk manageme=
nt: How do I get a basic level of assurance on the software coming into my =
enterprise, particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendo=
rs, on a continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s gr=
een today might be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app t=
hat your web agency developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some=
 venture-backed startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about secur=
ity).&nbsp;

s, so that suppliers are on the hook to remediate/update products as vulner=
abilities emerge?

                         How does this become a tractable process for procu=
rement and vendor management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber for=

                        <div>
                         This is also about pushing risk to the left in con=
tract provisions, and meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness,=
 as well as known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance policies.&nbsp;

                        </div>
                        <div>
                         <br>

                        <div>
                         1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services a=
pp development or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Go=
vernance criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibit=
ed components lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your product =
(containing malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell th=
at product to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One=
 of the big banks requires an SBOM for full pricing - any product without a=
n SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if it gets procured at all.
                         <br>
                         <br>2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM ever=
y day, parallel to whatever the supplier is doing for assurance.
                         <br>
                         <br>3) If the deliverable moves from green to red =
(e.g. new critical vulnerability), that change is time-stamped. Contract pr=
ovisions - security SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has=
 to push an update that remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stam=
p with third party certification that the supplier has met the provision or=
 not, in which case there might be remedies.&nbsp;
