Hi Josh,

Thank you again for the excellent conversation and coffee!=20

My sweet spot is digital product development: synthesizing strategy, capabil=
ities, etc. and using design to more into a new space or revitalize an exist=
ing space. I usually fall under Design or Product titles. I love the busines=
s design aspect as well, but usually avoid strategy titles as they tend to b=
e too far removed from the action for me.

My contact at Fjord is Olof Schybergson. We used to work together at Razorfi=
sh.
