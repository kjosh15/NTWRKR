Thanks for the followup, Tom. Mostly I was hoping there'd be appetite for
the outside-facing work around Marketing and Business Development I
suggested in the doc while Jon did similar work looking inward IDEO-wide.
Been pinging Ian (but haven't heard back yet) and am pretty clear that Greg
needs to focus on his immediate objectives. If you have anything to add
would love to hear it - and if there's anything you saw as missing in the
strategy I'm always game for improvement.

Thanks much for the reply; it was a pleasure working with you!
- J
