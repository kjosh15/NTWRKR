We do have lead-gen and commission agreements with channel partners if that=
=E2=80=99s something you=E2=80=99d be interested in. Snapshots of our lead-=
gen agreement are below - it=E2=80=99s a 5% commission on the first 12 mont=
hs of revenue from a customer, assuming a purchase is made within 24 months=
 of initial introduction.=20

If this makes sense, we can get an NDA in place and go from there.

development or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Gover=
nance criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibited =
components lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your product (co=
ntaining malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell that =
product to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One of=
