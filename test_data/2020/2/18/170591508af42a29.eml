Mike,

I recently ran into a couple new platforms that might be useful to your
members - specifically, a groundbreaking security platform for tech
deployments on the supply chain and an innovative outsourced hardware
developer focused on education and POC.

I run into these fairly often, but aside from direct requests from your
members don't do much with them. Is there a way W50 could benefit from
offering early/exclusive access?

All best,
Josh

P.S. I'm getting in the habit of throwing these weird ideas past you - let
me know if you need them better qualified, or if there's anything in
specific I should be keeping my eyes open for!
