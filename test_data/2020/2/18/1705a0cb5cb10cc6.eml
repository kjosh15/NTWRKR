Excellent - sounds like you've got a skill set that'll open any number of
doors. Do you have any particular spaces or domains in mind?

Would love to talk to Olof: he sounds like the perfect person at Fjord to
talk to! Do you mind brokering an intro? If you're looking for a one-liner
to facilitate one, how about:

"Josh has worked at the intersection of new and emerging technology and
strategy for almost a decade, having worked in mobile, cloud, ecommerce,
wearables, and more. Most recently he developed the technology strategy for
IDEO and currently hosts Accenture's Innovation Decoded podcast."

Many many thanks!
Josh
