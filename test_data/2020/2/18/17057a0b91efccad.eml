Josh

Thinking of sending this to Brian - thoughts?

C

 

 

Brian,

Can I ask if you would be interested in working with us on the training
element of Inclign/Indigo?

We have found that the expert led training materials that we link to on the
platform gain limited attention beyond high performers. This is the case
even if the expert led training is short in duration (less than 5 minutes)
and led by an engaging host (Lane 4 use various hosts and we have tried with
Josh as the expert!).

In one sense it isn't a problem because we are getting attention levels
around 30% of the workforce, which is higher than usual training approaches,
but we would like to offer materials that gain wider attention.

Our suggestion is that we link to more social media type material delivered
in relatable style by the leader of the relevant workplace - but we have
limited opportunities to develop this idea in the UK as Lane 4 are selling
expert led training and are wary of promoting leader driven content.

So in order to demonstrate the potential and to allow us to perform some
attention tests would it be possible for you to produce:

*	6, sub 1 minute videos . Each on the subject of one of Rivel's
workplace values
*	Shot social media style in a non-leadership environment (Boris
Johnson famously did one whilst making himself a cup of tea)
*	Each video is just you talking to the camera about. Why you chose
the value for Rivel, why you think it is important, your favourite example
of what the value looks like in day to day work life and an example of how
you yourself struggle to demonstrate the value and how you are working to
demonstrate it better.
*	We are looking for something that is relatable in social media style
and includes vulnerability / admission of your own challenges
*	We would then host the videos and use private links to link them to
Rivel's Inclign dashboards
*	Our hope is that this demonstrates the potential for leader driven
training that is algorithmically accessed via Inclign . This would play into
an increasing interest in helping employees along a "life long learning
journey" and also leaders' increasing use of social media. A recent
Financial Times article stated that 45% of technology CEOs and 25% of energy
company CEOs are now on Instagram as a way of promoting their company's
culture - so what we are looking to develop is a kind of internal social
media channel
*	Should the first videos be effective there is potential to broaden
out by asking other leaders to also record videos, again focussing on why
they feel the value is important and how they themselves are working on
improving their day to day performance

The overall goal would be to add an additional sales angle for Inclign and
to help us to demonstrate to others that soft skills training doesn't have
to be all expert led!

Chris
