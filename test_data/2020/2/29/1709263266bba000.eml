Just sent you an update on the call Monday. In the meantime, how's this for
a starting framework? David, would really love your take on what you think
this is missing.

# BlackRock Microtargeting Proposal

Pilot 1:
Target 1 person with a known email address and name.
target will see content about topic A* B* times in one month period
Exposure will happen on these platforms:
C?
D?
E?
Total cost should be F?

Expected outcome: Enough exposure for target to notice (with the assumption
that we could then craft content not to be noticeable, but still be
effective)

Pilot 2:

Target 10 people with known email addresses and names who are involved in a
deal
target will see content about topic A* B* times in one month period
Exposure will happen on these platforms:
C?
D?
E?
Total cost should be F?

Expected outcome: Measurable improvement in terms of final deal terms

A* This content would need to be readily available, cheap for us to access,
and distinguishable from content they would ordinarily see. What's a good
example?

B* What's reasonable for this?


Open questions:
Pixels - what does it take for this to happen?
Tracking - how do we do this and what sort of evidence can we provide?
Deployment - what's needed to deploy, what are the timelines (for creative,
ad buys, rollout, etc.)
Uncertainty - what are we uncertain about? What elements of the above are
known and reliable, and what do we need to discover?
