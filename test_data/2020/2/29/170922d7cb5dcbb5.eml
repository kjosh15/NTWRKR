Here's some notes from my conversation with her; there's a lot of great
feedback about how to position Indigo + how it compares and could stand out
against competitors:

She hates Glint:
trying to deploy took so much management
the tool didn't have momentum on it's own
ours has the potential for that b/c users can see their results
But if you need two full time project managers internally to run the
tool... sux
I.e., proposition needs to be:
hey internal people we need you for this phase, then it runs on autopilot
then we can bring you in at another phase
articulate exactly when you need partnership from them
don't want to be dependent on stakeholder management
really depends on political capital of manager
She used Culture Amp at AirBnB
just because it was first and stayed there
it was simple to use
backed stuff was super subpar
org cost of changing how they measure engagement was so high it was too much
it WILL change, but it takes a lot
That it's sticky is really important
we need a narrative about signal and noise too
how do you get people to pay attention to the email?
in some cultures needs to be slack, or...
how does it not just fade into one of the things employees get and ignore?
(Big problem in silicon valley)
could be part of the comms strategy
a unique positioning of it?
who is driving that? HR team? Exec team? What's our recommendation?
A point of view helps define that.
we need to get really clear on evaluative vs. developmental
evaluative: if it's being used to determine people's comp then it has to be
SUPER ACCURATE
if you're evaluating values that's super personal
i.e.: we are explicitly in the developmental feedback space - NOT to inform
compensation
BUT we could have an output that could be used for this ...
performance management is for HR, culture is for leader
Many HR teams think of themselves as culture leaders, but: they can promote
it but not create it. that's the role of leadership.
Being able to speak KPI is an important thing
gen Z and Millennial workforce: culture is a big reason people come to ans
stay at companies
make an argument about talent acquisition and attrition
There are SO MANY competitors in this space - really hard for Indigo
lots of people have closed ears to this sort of stuff
Possibility to partner with her to improve out messaging
how to differentiate ourselves and not just sound like another vender
> her unsolicited advice: switch out the white guy on the first page!!
