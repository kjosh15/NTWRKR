What's missing is that the software itself is a threat vector. If you make
a titanium case to protect your pastries but accidentally put plutonium in
them it's not going to make anyone safer. Ditto on the processes around
managing said software - they need to know it's built so that if/when
something goes wrong there are clear steps for resolution at every level.
Let me know if I can go deeper into this; it's likely to be a central issue
for our negotiation with them.
