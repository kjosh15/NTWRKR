Hi Josh=E2=80=94

Just back from France. Apologies for the delay. Thanks for answering =
these questions. Really helpful to have direct answers here.

A few thoughts below.

General

As we discussed, I think the basic premise of a technology show in =
various locales around the world to explore how and why different =
cultures are pursuing dissimilar avenues of technology is interesting. =
However, it still doesn=E2=80=99t strike me as hugely new or =
intriguing=E2=80=94as tech is so ubiquitous to us all now. But that may =
simply be because I=E2=80=99ve worked on such projects before. So take =
that with a grain of salt, as it=E2=80=99s just my own opinion.

Nonetheless, I personally don=E2=80=99t feel stories of life-saving =
African drones or money exchange apps will catch a huge amount of viewer =
attention. Quite ironically, I say that having filmed stories around =
both those topics in Africa just two months ago.

But I do think a program more attuned to the trickledown effect of tech =
into modern society is far more interesting to me=E2=80=94the good, the =
bad and the ugly=E2=80=94similar to what we discussed on the phone.

Practical steps

Together, these points would mean that text for a new treatment would =
need to be written. And though Texas Crew crafted a solid design =
aesthetic for the last treatment, I do feel it needs to be redone.

So the order of things would be:
Create a one-sheet with a show summary
Craft a new treatment that expands on the one-sheet=E2=80=99s summary, =
all housed within a new eye-catching design system
Write, shoot and develop a trailer or short cut of the show
Send materials to HP and/or other sponsors to gage interest
Approach networks with new reel, one-sheet/treatment and sponsorship =
agreement

What I can offer

Though I feel that the reformatted program we discussed is really great. =
I=E2=80=99m afraid I=E2=80=99m just not in a position right now to =
tackle these next steps. I=E2=80=99m already working on four other =
projects that are all in various stages of development and, without =
funding, I=E2=80=99m afraid I wouldn=E2=80=99t be able to devote the =
time you deserve to steering this potentially wonderful show in early =
development.

But I have a great deal of experience in guiding tech series, =
documentary programs and projects for BBC, Discovery and others. And I =
could be really helpful here as a show runner or EP once the project is =
a-go.

Alternatively, if a sponsor jumps the gun and offers upfront cash for =
early development, I can look into drafting out these materials.

Conclusion

I wish I could be of more help. Our interests and thinking are quite in =
sync on the project. But I at least hope this gives you an idea of where =
to go next. And maybe I can jump back in when the project is at a =
different stage. Let me know if I can help you answer any other =
questions though as you navigate this.

Best,
Matt

of technology is interesting. However, it still doesn=E2=80=99t strike =
me as hugely new or intriguing=E2=80=94as tech is so ubiquitous to us =

my own opinion.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
