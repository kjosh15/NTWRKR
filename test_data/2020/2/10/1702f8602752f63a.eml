I don=E2=80=99t think you necessarily need funding first. If the idea is go=

back from France. Apologies for the delay. Thanks for answering these quest=
ions. Really helpful to have direct answers here.</div><div><br></div><div>=
A few thoughts below.</div><div><br></div><div><i><b>General</b></i></div><=
div><br></div><div>As we discussed, I think the basic premise of a technolo=
gy show in various locales around the world to explore how and why differen=
t cultures are pursuing dissimilar avenues of technology is interesting. Ho=
wever, it still doesn=E2=80=99t strike me as hugely new or intriguing=E2=80=
=94as tech is so ubiquitous to us all now. But that may simply be because I=
=E2=80=99ve worked on such projects before. So take that with a grain of sa=
lt, as it=E2=80=99s just my own opinion.</div><div><br></div><div>Nonethele=
ss, I personally don=E2=80=99t feel stories of life-saving African drones o=
r money exchange apps will catch a huge amount of viewer attention. Quite i=
ronically, I say that having filmed stories around both those topics in Afr=
ica just two months ago.</div><div><br></div><div>But I do think a program =
more attuned to the trickledown effect of tech into modern society is far m=
ore interesting to me=E2=80=94the good, the bad and the ugly=E2=80=94simila=
r to what we discussed on the phone.</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>Practic=
al steps</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>Together, these points would mean=
 that text for a new treatment would need to be written. And though Texas C=
rew crafted a solid design aesthetic for the last treatment, I do feel it n=
eeds to be redone.</div><div><br></div><div>So the order of things would be=
:</div><div><ul><li>Create a one-sheet with a show summary</li><li>Craft a =
new treatment that expands on the one-sheet=E2=80=99s summary, all housed w=
ithin a new eye-catching design system</li><li>Write, shoot and develop a t=
railer or short cut of the show</li><li>Send materials to HP and/or other s=
ponsors to gage interest</li><li>Approach networks with new reel, one-sheet=
/treatment and sponsorship agreement</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div><b>=
<i>What I can offer</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>Though I feel that the=
 reformatted program we discussed is really great. I=E2=80=99m afraid I=E2=
=80=99m just not in a position right now to tackle these next steps. I=E2=
=80=99m already working on four other projects that are all in various stag=
es of development and, without funding, I=E2=80=99m afraid I wouldn=E2=80=
=99t be able to devote the time you deserve to steering this potentially wo=
nderful show in early development.</div><div><br></div><div>But I have a gr=
eat deal of experience in guiding tech series, documentary programs and pro=
jects for BBC, Discovery and others. And I could be really helpful here as =
a show runner or EP once the project is a-go.</div><div><br></div><div>Alte=
rnatively, if a sponsor jumps the gun and offers upfront cash for early dev=
elopment, I can look into drafting out these materials.</div><div><br></div=
><div><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>I wish I could be o=
f more help. Our interests and thinking are quite in sync on the project. B=
ut I at least hope this gives you an idea of where to go next. And maybe I =
can jump back in when the project is at a different stage. Let me know if I=
 can help you answer any other questions though as you navigate this.</div>=
