This is super helpful, Matt, thanks so much!! The only thing sticking in my
mind is the chicken-and-egg of corporate funding vs. channel commitment.
HP's CMO was at first reticent to move forward with something that didn't
have commitment from a channel before she invested. Do you have any
suggestions on how to approach the channels to get that? Or do you think we
need the funding first?

All best,
Josh

ink a program more attuned to the trickledown effect of tech into modern so=
ciety is far more interesting to me=E2=80=94the good, the bad and the ugly=
=E2=80=94similar to what we discussed on the phone.</div><div><br></div><di=
v><b><i>Practical steps</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>Together, these po=
ints would mean that text for a new treatment would need to be written. And=
 though Texas Crew crafted a solid design aesthetic for the last treatment,=
 I do feel it needs to be redone.</div><div><br></div><div>So the order of =
things would be:</div><div><ul><li>Create a one-sheet with a show summary</=
li><li>Craft a new treatment that expands on the one-sheet=E2=80=99s summar=
y, all housed within a new eye-catching design system</li><li>Write, shoot =
and develop a trailer or short cut of the show</li><li>Send materials to HP=
 and/or other sponsors to gage interest</li><li>Approach networks with new =
reel, one-sheet/treatment and sponsorship agreement</li></ul></div><div><br=
></div><div><b><i>What I can offer</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>Though =
I feel that the reformatted program we discussed is really great. I=E2=80=
=99m afraid I=E2=80=99m just not in a position right now to tackle these ne=
xt steps. I=E2=80=99m already working on four other projects that are all i=
n various stages of development and, without funding, I=E2=80=99m afraid I =
wouldn=E2=80=99t be able to devote the time you deserve to steering this po=
tentially wonderful show in early development.</div><div><br></div><div>But=
 I have a great deal of experience in guiding tech series, documentary prog=
rams and projects for BBC, Discovery and others. And I could be really help=
ful here as a show runner or EP once the project is a-go.</div><div><br></d=
iv><div>Alternatively, if a sponsor jumps the gun and offers upfront cash f=
or early development, I can look into drafting out these materials.</div><d=
iv><br></div><div><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>I wish =
I could be of more help. Our interests and thinking are quite in sync on th=
e project. But I at least hope this gives you an idea of where to go next. =
And maybe I can jump back in when the project is at a different stage. Let =
me know if I can help you answer any other questions though as you navigate=
 this.</div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Matt</div><div><br></div><d=

 a commitment from a channel so they could evaluate the media spend for val=
