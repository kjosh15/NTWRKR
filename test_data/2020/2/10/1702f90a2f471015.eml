We ought to talk to your brother/folks about help in buying tickets for you
and the boys. Worst case scenario I'll buy tickets last minute for less
than the whole time you're there (pending negotiations) at a premium price,
best case we'll nail something down sooner and I'll come for the whole
time... either way, I believe it's worth it for the boys to be in Iceland
over the summer.

Let's talk and make plans!!

xoxo,
Josh

P.S. Looks like Paris is off the table for this summer, which simplifies
things.
