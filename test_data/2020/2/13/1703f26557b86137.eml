Was walking through the demo site in prep. for our Bechtel mtg tomorrow,
and had a few notes - I assume you have most of these but figured passing
them over for you to dismiss was better than something being missed.

> "What does my score measure" links to a table with no contents

> "See how my score has changed" could be dynamic - to show how someone has
changed over different time ranges, with different groups, etc.

> Culture Dashboard should be folding - i.e., click on "Central Services"
and have it collapse or roll out. This lets you look at aggregate scores
more easily from a different view.

> All graphs should have rollover tooltips; i.e., if I'm looking at a score
history it should be easy to put my cursor over any point in any line and
find out what that line represents AND what the exact score at that point
is.

Was great to walk through this top to bottom again on my own - this
platform is amazing!!!
