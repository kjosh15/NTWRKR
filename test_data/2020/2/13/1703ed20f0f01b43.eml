Small and medium companies have to do it because larger customers - =

a lot of public companies and software vendors that do business with the =
military/intel community) and regulated industry (energy, telecom, =
healthcare, finance, critical manufacturing, transportation, smart =
cities, election infrastructure). There are hundreds of thousands of =
corporate entities who are regulated to care, and the mandates that kick =
