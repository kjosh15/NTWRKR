This seems like a super smart 3rd party service, but do you think Corning
could be made to understand it?

Thanks for this! I can already think of a few people to pass this to. Can
you follow up with an email contextualizing this for small, medium, and
large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and some with the
former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is a new target
for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).


The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterprise with a
large supplier network - is third party risk management: How do I get a
basic level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise,
particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a
continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green today=
 might
be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app that your web age=
ncy
developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some venture-backed
startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about security).

How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliverables (and their
updates) developed outside your boundary?

How do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so that suppliers are
on the hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabilities emerge?

How does this become a tractable process for procurement and vendor
management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber forensics that they=
=E2=80=99re not
staffed to take on?

This is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and
meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as
known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance policies.

An example:

1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services app development or vendor
product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Governance criteria are
enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibited components lists -
if you have certain Python libraries in your product (containing malware,
per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell that product to JP Morg=
an Chase
- it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One of the big banks requires an =
SBOM for
full pricing - any product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if
it gets procured at all.

2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to whatever
the supplier is doing for assurance.

3) If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical
vulnerability), that change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - security
SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has to push an update
that remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stamp with third party
certification that the supplier has met the provision or not, in which case
there might be remedies.



Does this make sense?



JC



Separately, any thinking you may have on how to propose a workable
deployment with gov't would be hugely appreciated.

Sincerely,
Josh
