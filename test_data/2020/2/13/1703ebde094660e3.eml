So I=E2=80=99m getting introduced to
Description
Michelle Caruso-Cabrera=E2=80=98s producer at CNBC and realized I have no f=
ucking
idea what I=E2=80=99m pitching to him - I haven=E2=80=99t had a tv since I =
was 12!! Any
chance I could get 30m with you to talk this over quickly in the next week
or so? I=E2=80=99ve no trouble responding to or identifying tech content, b=
ut don=E2=80=99t
know if I should be planning for 25m of q&a, twenty seconds of sound bytes,
or what!!

OTOH, this definitely feels like a good opp; if I can craft something with
some flexibility it could be a great chance to build platform in a big way.
Seems to have worked well for you!!

Also, I know Andrew Sorkin (we met at Davos) fwiw - so there are other
avenues in.

Many thanks in advance,
Josh
