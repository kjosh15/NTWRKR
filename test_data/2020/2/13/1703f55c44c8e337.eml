Yep, still in NYC. Pondering what to try next and am considering doing a
big corp. like Google, Apple, or the like as a bigger part of the
portfolio. Strange times...

Let me know if there's anyone else I can introduce you to or if I can be of
any other help - do you have a specific angle on how you're pitching this
programming? I.e., is there something specific you want to do around this
kind of programming that's new or different?
