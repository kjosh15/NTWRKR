Hey Josh, great to hear from you.

Sorry about the slow response - was out with flu most of the last couple we=
eks.

Things are going well,=C2=A0we launched recently with a $9M first close ( h=
ttps://twitter.com/PronomosVC/status/1207714673547599873 ). As we transitio=
n from fundraising to operations, and from a one-man operation to a team/co=
mmunity, I am hard at work to formalize a concrete strategy and roadmap. Ri=
ght now, we don't really have clear partnership strategies, materials, or a=
sks.

The biggest thing we need right now is more capital - our ideal investor wo=
uld be an aggressive family office who'd write a $1M-$5M check to join our =
premium LPs & get access to the unique stream of later-stage real estate op=
portunities we're generating. Basically, converting our social proof into b=
igger checks from more staid investors.

Second thing is a GP for fund II, someone with integrity, leadership, who g=
ets the philosophy of competing govts, and who has solid international real=
 estate investment experience that would look good to institutional investo=
rs.

We don't particularly need country intros or dealflow (have plenty), partne=
rships (still figuring out what we want), media (we're ramping it up v. gra=
dually). We're def interested in partnerships with later-stage capital prov=
iders ("We'd invest $30M for the first build of an approved charter city in=
 the next 2 years"), or large anchor tenants ("We'd like to locate a 1000-p=
erson facility in a new business-friendly jurisdiction in the next 2 years"=
) .

I'll put you on the list for private updates too, we have a few coinvestmen=
t deals that we'll be sending in in the next week. And you're in the CRM to=
 ping for feedback as we start having internal docs for review. A big part =
of my focus this quarter is on documenting our philosophy, approach, strate=
gy, and culture.

Best,

=C2=A0 Patri

aunched recently with a $9M first close</a>. As we transition from fundrais=
ing to operations, and from a one-man operation to a team/community, I am h=
ard at work to formalize a concrete strategy and roadmap. Right now, we don=
&#39;t really have clear partnership strategies, materials, or asks.<br/></=
div><div><br/></div><div>The biggest thing we need right now is more capita=
l - our ideal investor would be an aggressive family office who&#39;d write=
 a $1M-$5M check to join our premium LPs &amp; get access to the unique str=
eam of later-stage real estate opportunities we&#39;re generating. Basicall=
y, converting our social proof into bigger checks from more staid investors=
.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Second thing is a GP for fund II, someone =
with integrity, leadership, who gets the philosophy of competing govts, and=
 who has solid international real estate investment experience that would l=
ook good to institutional investors.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>We don&=
#39;t particularly need country intros or dealflow (have plenty), partnersh=
ips (still figuring out what we want), media (we&#39;re ramping it up v. gr=
adually). We&#39;re def interested in partnerships with later-stage capital=
 providers (&#34;We&#39;d invest $30M for the first build of an approved ch=
arter city in the next 2 years&#34;), or large anchor tenants (&#34;We&#39;=
d like to locate a 1000-person facility in a new business-friendly jurisdic=
tion in the next 2 years&#34;) .<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I&#39;ll pu=
t you on the list for private updates too, we have a few coinvestment deals=
 that we&#39;ll be sending in in the next week. And you&#39;re in the CRM t=
o ping for feedback as we start having internal docs for review. A big part=
 of my focus this quarter is on documenting our philosophy, approach, strat=
