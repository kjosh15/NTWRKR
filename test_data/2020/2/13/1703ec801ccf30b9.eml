Makes complete sense, but I wonder about how you=E2=80=99re going to get ac=
cess to
decision makers who aren=E2=80=99t siloed to the point of impotence for a p=
roject
like this - again, considering where risk (specifically cyber risk) is
situated, I could see a CTO at a large company mandating this ... but never
enforcing it.

Conversely, does a small to midsize company have the business imperatives
to protect themselves this way, or is it going to be business as usual -
growth first, security fifth?

Separately, would love your take on approaching intelligence communities -
it sounded as though you had some good insights to share!
