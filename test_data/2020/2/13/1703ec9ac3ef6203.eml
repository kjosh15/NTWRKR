Re: the government deployment, there is no way on God=E2=80=99s green =
earth that the product will be approved for use on anything except =
government infrastructure, which for this customer means C2S, the =
classified AWS cloud. C2S has, to put it mildly, some quirks. But a =
relatively simple system shouldn=E2=80=99t run into technical =

To get this done, you=E2=80=99ll need a pro services partner that is =
already on-site and cleared to deploy software. You=E2=80=99ll need some =
basic software assurance running continuously (i.e. live state knowledge =

runs, so that when you deploy the system into a copy of C2S you can see =
the little places where it breaks (mostly because it=E2=80=99s calling =
out to the Internet, which isn=E2=80=99t possible on C2S) - that saves =
time and cost, because it eliminates (most of) the telephone game of =
tickets about why something=E2=80=99s not working on a network you =
don=E2=80=99t have access to. All of this can (and should) be priced =
into your proposal.=20

Nothing that touches agency personnel, anonymized or not, will ever run =
on commercial SaaS. Given that, your folks need to do cost-benefit on =
whether it=E2=80=99s worth winning this opportunity. I can make the =
intro to the deployment experts, if you still want to go forward.=20
