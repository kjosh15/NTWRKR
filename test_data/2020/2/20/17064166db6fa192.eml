Vikram,

I LOVE this!! The game design / reality tv approach is genius, although I
think it could be really sharpened by tying it into one of the (many)
corporate sponsored efforts being made around any number of environmental
impact programs right now.

For example, Estonia developed an app to gamify picking up litter in their
forests, and transformed both the countryside and civic engagement.
Pokemon Go (I know the lead developers) was used to spin off exercise
programs for obesity fighting campaigns in the midwest. Carma Carpooling
helps you find nearby people to share your commute to reduce traffic and
emissions. Dropcountr enables you to conserve water by connecting you to
your water utility company via your smartphone. Farmstand helps you
discover locally grown food from more than 8,700 farmers markets. Just
google "IOS games for environmental impact" and you can find plenty of apps
which gamified specific environmental initiatives well above and beyond
straight "edutainment."

Fundamentally, I think you've got all the right elements, but if you take a
different "campaign" each episode from a large corporate sponsor you could
a) fund the winning team, b) get additional investment for production, c)
increase media footprint for the corporate, d) tie it into real-world
impact, and e) give a short summary of the previous episode's impact with
each show.

Does this sound on point? Would love to brianstorm further if you think
there's a there there!

All best,
Josh
