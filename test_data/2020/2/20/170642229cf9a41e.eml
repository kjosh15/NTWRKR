Dawn, thanks so much for the intro! (To bcc.)

Todd, pleasure to connect with you. If you're game I'd love to schedule a
short call (or a coffee if you have time!) to catch up and see where there
may be overlap. Let me know if you're around in the next couple weeks to
connect!

All best,
Josh
