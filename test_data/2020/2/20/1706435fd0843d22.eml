Subject: Leader Lead "Training"


Brian,

Can I ask if you would be interested in working with us on the training ele=
ment of Inclign/Indigo?

We have found that expert led training materials (that we link to) gain lim=
ited attention beyond high performers. This is the case even if the expert =
led training is short in duration (less than 5 minutes) and led by an engag=
ing host (Lane 4 use various hosts and we have tried with Josh as the exper=
t!).

In one sense it isn=92t a problem because we are getting attention levels a=
round 30% of the workforce, which is higher than usual training approaches,=
 but we would like to offer materials that gain wider attention.

Our suggestion is that we link to more social media type material delivered=
 in relatable style by the leader of the relevant workplace =96 but we have=
 limited opportunities to develop this idea in the UK as Lane 4 are selling=
 expert led training and are wary of promoting leader driven content.

So in order to demonstrate the potential and to allow us to perform some at=
tention tests would it be possible for you to produce the following?

  *   6, sub 1 minute videos . Each on the subject of one of Rivel=92s work=
place values
  *   Shot social media style in a non-leadership environment (Boris Johnso=
n famously did one whilst making himself a cup of tea)
  *   Each video is just you talking to the camera about: Why you chose the=
 value for Rivel, why you think it is important, your favourite example of =
what the value looks like in day to day work life and an example of how you=
 yourself struggle to demonstrate the value and how you are working to demo=
nstrate it better.
  *   We are looking for something that is relatable in social media style =
and includes vulnerability / admission of your own challenges
  *   We would then host the videos and use private links to link them to R=
ivel=92s Inclign dashboards
  *   Our hope is that this demonstrates the potential for leader driven tr=
aining that is algorithmically accessed via Inclign . This would play into =
an increasing interest in helping employees along a =93life long learning j=
ourney=94, the need to build trust in leaders through a workforce (this com=
es up quite bit in Lane 4=92s RFPs) and also leaders=92 increasing use of s=
ocial media. A recent Financial Times article stated that 45% of technology=
 CEOs and 25% of energy company CEOs are now on Instagram as a way of promo=
ting their company=92s culture =96 so what we are looking to develop is a k=
ind of internal social media channel
  *   Should the first videos be effective there is potential to broaden ou=
t by asking other leaders to also record videos, again focussing on why the=
y feel the value is important and how they themselves are working on improv=
ing their day to day performance

The overall goal would be to add an additional sales angle for Inclign and =
to help us to demonstrate to others that soft skills training doesn=92t hav=
e to be all expert led.

Chris
