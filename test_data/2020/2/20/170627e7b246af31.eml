Abraham,

Last spring Hulda managed the estate for a friend who had just passed. One
of the reimbursements for this was $20k from an IRA. We requested they send
this in the proper form for us to submit directly into our own IRA so we
could avoid any tax implications (I believe we asked you about all this
late last summer.)

Now we think we=E2=80=99re getting a straight check sent to us in the mail.=
 Do you
know if we can cash this into our IRA directly without implications, if
this nullifies our ability to avoid taxes, or...? Any feedback in advance
is appreciated!

Much obliged,
Josh
