I wanted to set a time for a short call in the coming weeks to see =
how/if we can help each other this year. I'm spending increasing time =
coaching high value talent on innovation strategy and new tech, doing =
direct advising on same to both startups and executive boards, and of =
course have a few fun projects running on the side (a psychometrics SaaS =
platform measuring culture, an IoT Wellness lab, and an AI for =
networking project among others!)<br class=3D"">

Let me know if you have a half hour to talk and tell me what you're =
building in 2019!<br class=3D"">

All best wishes,<br class=3D"">
