Arkady,

Thanks for doing this digging, and apologies in advance as I crawl up the
learning curve.

Several questions, inline below:

What is a $200 CPM, and how would that result in spending less than $1.00
for an entire campaign?

What are average listening costs? If the ROI on getting the right
impressions in front of the right people is high enough, listening costs
may be negligible.

Making custom page pixels isn't an inordinate cost, again esp. compared to
the potential ROI for a big deal. What would that look like and what would
average costs be?

IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at a certain
time, but if that happens to be an office building with several thousand
people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enough to be
useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that correct?

They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for, but it's
not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 impressions in
front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course of a month.
That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their confidence
on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it?

best,
Josh

     They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking for, but =
it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 impressio=
ns in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the course of a =
month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is their confi=
dence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it?

                        <br>
                        <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to hear =
your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers. Here's=
 the use case we want to try to prove:
                        <br>
                        <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an office)=
, email address, and phone
                        <br>- We can get the target to click on a link
                        <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, either for=
 cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                        <br>
                        <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd like to =
see evidence of:
                        <br>
                        <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a two we=
ek timespan
                        <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie after a c=
ertain period of time
                        <br>- any additional tracking data on the target
                        <br>
                        <br>This would likely be deployed in the US or UK. =
Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for $1-2k=
 to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a client to =
partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end please=
 do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost saving=
s, benefits of scale, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>Thanks so much!
                        <br>Josh
