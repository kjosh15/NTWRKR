Just spoke to a contact at LinkedIn; he's going to introduce me to their
team in business development as well as someone who did a big project there
around purpose driven organizations. I'm working on how to present Indigo
as distinct from our competitors, but in the meantime he brought up
https://www.glintinc.com/ which is worth another look - they've really
expanded their service offerings, how they describe their impact, the
portfolio of features, etc. This is what we're competing with, and a LOT of
it is just language. I think we could update both our decks and our site if
we wanted to invest in the marketing effort... but am equally concerned
about what we're losing if we don't. Thoughts?
