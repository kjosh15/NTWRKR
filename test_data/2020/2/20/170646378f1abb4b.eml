2019
Notes from:

Ask in advance. Birthday together or separate? Do a winter break trip to a
waterpark instead of a birthday party? Cupcakes or cake? Party at home like
last year? (read notes from previous years for more info)

1/3 sheet cake from Cannelles was more then enough for 19 people (including
us,12 kids). Coco Fraise was delish. Cannelles has an online store now.

Bagels, cream cheese, butter, coffee, fruit, juice boxes, soda water.
Upgrade with plain cream cheese, avocado slices, tomato slices, olives,
cured meats, lox, onion and capers. Remember to put out creamer dairy and
non dairy and sugar.

Yes on goody bags for home birthday. Boys like it. We can make homemade
playdough for the bags as a non plastic addition.

Wish we'd worked with the boys to make a card or gift for each other.

Buy red roses for =C3=93=C3=B0inn

Remeber to write everything in Icelandic. =C3=A1ra, til hamingju me=C3=B0 a=
fm=C3=A6li=C3=B0
etc.

Really think about an activity and game beforehand

Order party plates, glasses, bowls, napkins before hand

Make time to decorate before party.

parents shower, bathe and shave before party

Ask if the boys want birthday outfit next year?

Factor in party downtime for =C3=93=C3=B0inn

measure boys height

Take anything away that you don't want swept up in the party away from kids
reach

Ask someone to take photos. Take lots of photos yourself

Cut cats claws before party

If doing bagels, buy plain cream cheese

Parents try getting a walk before party

Decorating birthday crown was a great activity

Decorate in a way that you can run the fans. It's hot with all the fans.

pick up balloons the day of the party. Party Glitter on Roosevelt has good
ones. Get enough for each kid to take at least one home.

2.5 hours is enough time for the boys.


9:30 am talk to boys about etiquette. Greet everyone, say thanks for the
present, don't open present, instead put in designated area. Then when
people leave, walk them to the door and say thanks for coming. Pick music.
Start aromatherapy.

10 am Greet, coats on bed

10:45 am Crafts or games. Prepare party hats

11:30 am prepare cake in kitchen, turn of the lights, bring cake out with
candles and start the singing.

12:30 pm say goodbye, send of with goody bags and balloons

2018 Notes from:

Talk to boys well in advance about a joint vs. separate birthday=C2=B4s. It=
 was
hard for =C3=93=C3=B0inn to have his party before his actual birthday, do t=
he party
after the 8th next year. If joint or Othinn=C2=B4s 3 hours. Solo h=C3=A1kon=
 2 hours
tops. Ask the boys what type of cake or cupcake they'd like. This year
Othinn asked for a cupcake cake but didn't get it because Josh and I
weren't clear. Be clear with ourselves and make it in advance.

I'm buying long glitter birthday candles for 2019. I'll put them in the
seasonal box.

Write down a timeline with Josh before hand. He can get a little ahead of
himself and forgets to make it festive and fun, serves cake without the
candles or singing for example.

8:30 am Talk to boys about not tearing open gifts but waiting to open until
the guests leave. Have a designated gift table. Saying thank you when you
receive a gift and saying goodbye and thank you for coming when people
leave.

9:30 am Pick music

10 am receive guests. Outerwear on bed. Serve coffee and bagels (or
whatever we're offering)

10:45 am craft project. Make you're own party hat next year? T-shirts were
fun this year.

11:30 am party hats, light candles, turn of lights, sing happy birthday and
then make sure everyone has cake.

12:30 Say goodbye and send off with goody bag if that's what we want.

Put together the party hats in advance.
2019 I'd love to buy themed garlands on Etsy but need to do it well in
advance. Put them up for the actual family birthday. Crepe streamers didn't
work out that well but were fun.
Making a garland with their age in Icelandic was awesome. 6. =C3=A1ra and 3=
. =C3=A1ra
next year. Make in advance if possible.
We forgot to write =C3=93=C3=B0inn a card. Lets buy cards for both boys nex=
t year.
Pick something up at Lockwood.
Take boys separately shopping to Frank=C2=B4s pharmacy, Lockwood or the art
supply store to pick up a gift for each other. Worked beautifully 2018.
Boys love the painted window. Do it on the night before their actual
birthday.
Make or sign a stack of thank you cards afterwards.



2016


make homemade playdough or muffins for party favors


m&m cake



paint window



helium balloons for all kids



4 friends



wake him up with hot cocoa and candles (set alarm, make cocoa night before)



clean house



x buy wrapping paper,

wrap gifts



ask what 4 friends he want to invite

make invites with him

write a card

open 1 or 2 gifts in the morning. =C3=93=C3=B0inn gets easily overwhelmed w=
ith gifts
so maybe skip opening them at the party. Just find a location at party and
make sure to note down who brought what.

bring cake or muffins to school



2015

p=C3=B6nnuk=C3=B6kur, pizza, moomin pabbi in the window, balloons, wake up =
with cocoa
and candles. Party with lots of kids and lots of adults. Was very loud.
