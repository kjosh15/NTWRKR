                It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands=
 now we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we nee=
d to affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

                For example, the most likely case study is three different =
groups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so =
30-60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone=
 #'s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would =
point them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect=
 them this project doesn't work.=20

                             It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard =
retargeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressio=
ns and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order t=
o maximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $20=
0 CPM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                   Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on t=
he DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DS=
P side to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's=
 not proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they'r=
e proven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.=

                            But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There =
is no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work w=
ith a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering=
 to minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of =
10) impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                   Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have=
 with my DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can =
leverage extra account management as needed as long as there's some decent =

                            The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it=
's not guaranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add =
a branding DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting =
to the strategy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the b=

                      IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain=

 several thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly spe=

                   That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (co=

                      They certainly sound like they're selling what we're =
looking for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to ge=
t 10-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over=
 the course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) wh=
at is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can the=
y prove it?

                  <div>
                   Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp;=
 So if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need =
more scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger perce=
ntage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbs=
p; Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on th=
e list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                         Arkady,
                                         <br>
                                         <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Wa=
s stoked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get som=
e answers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                         <br>
                                         <br>- We provide a name, address (=
likely an office), email address, and phone
                                         <br>- We can get the target to cli=
ck on a link
                                         <br>- We can provide a dummy URL t=
o use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                         <br>
                                         <br>Once the cookie has been dropp=
ed, we'd like to see evidence of:
                                         <br>
                                         <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impression=
s within a two week timespan
                                         <br>- ability to self destruct the=
 cookie after a certain period of time
                                         <br>- any additional tracking data=
 on the target
                                         <br>
                                         <br>This would likely be deployed =
in the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial =
RFP was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking=
 for a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. T=
o that end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, pote=
ntial cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                         <br>
                                         <br>Thanks so much!
