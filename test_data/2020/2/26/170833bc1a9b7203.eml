The guy I spoke to was too junior - he's just recently joined the bizdev
team from the L&D sales team, but he was able to help me figure out that we
have much better granularity than Glint (their recent acquisition) and that
LinkedIn just wants to see that we can add customers / pipeline to their
ROI in terms of partnerships. I'll be circling back with him in a month
(when he's more grounded in his new group) but in the meantime he asked for
some bullet points to share with the team. I'd suggested we provide a
bullet point list of:

differentiators (Glint vs. Indigo)
what we're looking for (big data, content for our partners)
current customers (to show we're additive to their ROI)

Can you help with this?

- J

P.S. I have another contact at LinkedIn I'm getting a call with shortly, so
this should help in framing that up.
