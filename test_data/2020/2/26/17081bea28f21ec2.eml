I'm waiting for a couple introductions to firms that do nothing BUT SOC2
compliance. It'd likely require an expense, a time committment, and some
significant code updates. My suggestion is that we a) work with Bechtel to
get a minimum-required list of documents (ultimately not fully SOC2
compliant but part of that total) in place to allow us to work together, or
b) ask for them to help fund the compliance as part of working together.
Thoughts?
