Hi Josh and David,

I have a call/screenshare set up with Influ2 at 8am tomorrow.

Let me know if you can join.  If not, I'll cover our main subject of
maximizing engagement with our small group of targets.

I think they're pretty eager to take this on if we can get a much bigger
client to sign on with us.  They may even do it for a smaller fee to get
the business.

Thanks,

Arkady

      It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now we're=
 likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need to affec=

      For example, the most likely case study is three different groups of =
10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-60 *tot=
al*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s, and =
working addresses, and could easily send them content that would point them=
 to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect them this=
 project doesn't work.=20

      On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals, the ROI=
 will be substantial.

                   It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retargetin=
g. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and lim=
ited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximize=
 the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. The=
 spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                  But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no guar=
antee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a smal=
l number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minimi=
ze the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impres=
sions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

         Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with my D=

                  The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not gua=

 DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the str=

            IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at =
a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with several t=
housand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific enou=
gh to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that co=

         That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (commercial b=
uilding) will be very difficult, thats why we typically to Lat Long and Day=
 parting to reach a certain "audience" at a certain location but not necess=
arily particular people.&nbsp; Again, it's not tested on specific people us=
ing DSP's and I'm not sure if it will 100% as effective and trackable as In=
flu2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting pla=
tform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brands in the US=
 doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to move to the=
 US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a secret=
 marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on the=
 open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individuals =
you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their en=
gagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as follo=
ws but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability of =
reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your pool t=
he more you can reach:&nbsp;

               <div>
                I'm very interested in partnering with them for future proj=

US.&nbsp; &nbsp;For this project, I'd like to be involved with them directl=

            They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking fo=
r, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 im=
pressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the cours=
e of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is thei=
r confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove it=
?

         Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So if it'=
s 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more scale=
 at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage.&nbs=
p; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Can you=
 get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the list of =
100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                               <br>- We can get the target to click on a li=
nk
                               <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, eit=
her for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                               <br>
                               <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd l=
ike to see evidence of:
                               <br>
                               <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within a=
 two week timespan
                               <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie af=
ter a certain period of time
                               <br>- any additional tracking data on the ta=
rget
                               <br>
                               <br>This would likely be deployed in the US =
or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was fo=
r $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a cli=
ent to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end=
 please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cost=
 savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                               <br>
                               <br>Thanks so much!
