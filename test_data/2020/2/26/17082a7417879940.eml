             It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands no=
w we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need t=

             For example, the most likely case study is three different gro=
ups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-=
60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'=
s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would poi=
nt them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect th=
em this project doesn't work.=20

             On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals, =
the ROI will be substantial.

                          It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard ret=
argeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions =
and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to m=
aximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 C=
PM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                   What is a $200 CPM, and how would that result in spendin=

                Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the =
DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP s=
ide to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's no=
t proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're p=

                         But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is =
no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with=
 a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to=
 minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10)=
 impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                   What are average listening costs? If the ROI on getting =
the right impressions in front of the right people is high enough, listenin=
g costs may be negligible.&nbsp;

                Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have wi=
th my DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can lev=
erage extra account management as needed as long as there's some decent spe=
nd happening on the DSP at least $3K per campaign per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                         The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's =
not guaranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a b=
randing DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to =
the strategy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the busi=
ness we're targeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&n=

                   IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain pl=
ace at a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with se=
veral thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specif=
ic enough to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is =

                That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (comme=

                         I've been in touch with the founder of an interest=
ing platform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brands in=
 the US doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to move=
 to the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a=
 secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads=
 on the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the indiv=
iduals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score t=
heir engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is a=
s follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probabil=
ity of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your=
 pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                   They certainly sound like they're selling what we're loo=
king for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 1=
0-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over th=
e course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what =
is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they p=
rove it?

                Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So=
 if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need mor=
e scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percenta=
ge.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; =
Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the l=
ist of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                      Arkady,
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was s=
toked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some a=
nswers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                      <br>
                                      <br>- We provide a name, address (lik=
ely an office), email address, and phone
                                      <br>- We can get the target to click =
on a link
                                      <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to u=
se, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Once the cookie has been dropped,=
 we'd like to see evidence of:
                                      <br>
                                      <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions w=
ithin a two week timespan
                                      <br>- ability to self destruct the co=
okie after a certain period of time
                                      <br>- any additional tracking data on=
 the target
                                      <br>
                                      <br>This would likely be deployed in =
the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP=
 was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking fo=
r a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To t=
hat end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potenti=
al cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Thanks so much!
                                      <br>Josh
