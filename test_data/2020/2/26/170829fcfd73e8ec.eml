           It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now =
we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need to =
affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

           For example, the most likely case study is three different group=
s of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-60=
 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s,=
 and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would point=
 them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect them=
 this project doesn't work.=20

           <br>

          <div>
           On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals, th=
e ROI will be substantial.

                        It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retar=
geting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions an=
d limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to max=
imize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM=
. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

              Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DS=
P side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP sid=
e to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not =
proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're pro=
ven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&nbsp=

                       But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no=
 guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a=
 small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to m=
inimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) i=
mpressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

              Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with=
 my DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can lever=
age extra account management as needed as long as there's some decent spend=
 happening on the DSP at least $3K per campaign per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                       The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's no=
t guaranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a bra=
nding DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to th=
e strategy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the busine=

                 IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain plac=
e at a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with seve=
ral thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific=
 enough to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is th=

              That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (commerc=

o the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a s=
ecret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads o=
n the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individ=
uals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score the=
ir engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as =
follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probabilit=
y of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your p=

                 They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looki=

15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the =

              Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So i=
f it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more =
scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage=
.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Ca=
n you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the lis=
t of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                    <br>
                                    <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was sto=
ked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some ans=
wers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>- We provide a name, address (likel=
y an office), email address, and phone
                                    <br>- We can get the target to click on=
 a link
                                    <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use=
, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, w=
e'd like to see evidence of:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions wit=
hin a two week timespan
                                    <br>- ability to self destruct the cook=
ie after a certain period of time
                                    <br>- any additional tracking data on t=
he target
                                    <br>
                                    <br>This would likely be deployed in th=
e US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP w=
as for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for =
a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To tha=
t end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential=
 cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Thanks so much!
