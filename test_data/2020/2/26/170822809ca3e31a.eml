Chris,

Wanted to review what our talk description (
https://schedule.sxsw.com/2020/events/PP98902) promises to the folks
attending:

1. nation states
2. control to corporations
3. we can have a hand in how we're controlled
4. what we've learned about engineering culture change in corporations
5. practical tools you can use to
mitigate the damage
proactively design for transparent impact aligned with values

So far we have #1 (slides 2-8), #2 (slides 9-14), and #3 (slides 16-23 or
so). But we really need:

4. what we've learned about engineering culture change in corporations
(right now only mention identity, embed, and that something is possible.)

and

5. practical tools you can use. There are placeholder slides right now for:
"mitigate the damage" and "proactively design for transparent impact
aligned with values" but neither are fleshed out.


We need more examples for #3, 4, and 5. Specifically:

3. we can have a hand in how we're controlled

This is where we showcase Indigo and how awesome it is

4. what we've learned about engineering culture change in corporations

This is where we illustrate the barriers to entry to competitors

5. practical tools you can use to

This is where we create openings for partners and clients who want to work
with us.

Any ideas of stories, anecdotes, and specific examples?

best,
Josh
