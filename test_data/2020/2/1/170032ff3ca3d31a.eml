     <div>Hey Josh,<br /><br />Since these reauthorization settings are=
 <strong>determined completely by Capital One and their security protoco=
ls, we can't estimate if or when they'll change them</strong> to allow f=
or easier access to your data. I know that's not the answer you were loo=
king for, but I want to be clear so that you can make the best choice fo=
r your budgeting situation.<br /><br />If these frequent reauthorization=
s are too burdensome and you decide to end your subscription, I complete=
ly understand. But if you'd like to try out some of our <a href=3D"https=
://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/32-adding-transactions">alternate tra=
nsaction entry methods</a> that will help you automate your accounts whi=
le relying less on CapOne's connectivity, I wanted to share my budgeting=
 workflow in case it would be helpful for you:<br /><ol><li>I've created=
 <a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/165-scheduled-transac=
tions"><strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong></a> for recurring or pred=
ictable transactions like my paycheck, rent, utilities, insurances, subs=
criptions like Netflix, etc. I set the date and frequency of the transac=
tion once and YNAB automatically enters them at those intervals for me.<=
/li><li>I use our <strong>mobile app</strong> to record spending while I=
'm out. This one's always been hard to remember for me, so I keep myself=
 disciplined by entering a transaction as soon as a cashier hands me the=
 receipt, before I put it in my wallet.</li><li><a href=3D"http://docs.y=
ouneedabudget.com/article/173-file-based-import"><strong>File-Based Impo=
rting</strong></a> fills in any gaps where I might've missed a transacti=
on during the week.</li><li>I <strong><a href=3D"https://www.youneedabud=
get.com/video-courses/using-your-ynab-budget/lesson-3/unit-3/#course-pla=
yer">reconcile my accounts</a> </strong>at least once a week, which ensu=
res that their balances are 100% accurate and that no missing, incorrect=
, duplicate, or uncleared transactions have slipped through the cracks i=
n the last few days.</li></ol><br />That routine keeps me in my budget a=
bout <strong>5 minutes a day</strong> between my Capital One and USAA ac=
counts, <em>maybe</em> 10 minutes if I'm reconciling all four individual=
 accounts at once. With this method of active-entry, your budget will be=
 <em>more</em> up to date than if you rely solely on Capital One to impo=
rt your transactions, and will lead to heightened awareness and prioriti=
zation over your spending &amp; saving. It's worked well for me, so I ho=
pe you'll give it a shot if you'd like to keep using YNAB and the YNAB M=
ethod. <br /><br />Let me know if you have any additional questions! <br=

 there won't be any new transactions to import when you check your budge=
t Sunday morning, you don't need to reauthorize the connection that time=

ny announcements when they put these protocols in place, so I'm not very=
 hopeful that they'll announce when they might change again. As a custom=
er I wish they'd give us the option to control our <em>own</em> account=

n if import isn't currently available. This is also why we don't alter t=
he cost for folks whose banks aren't supported at all.<br /><br />I hope=
 you can understand where we're coming from there. <span>Since I can see=
 you've been communicating with us about Capital One for <em>awhile</em>=
, I've added on a free month to your subscription as a more tangible apo=
logy. I know it doesn't replace a completely smooth Direct Import experi=
ence, but I hope it helps a little. You're now set until <strong>June 21=
, 2020.</strong><br /><br />And as Kait mentioned before, if YNAB is no=
 longer the best budgeting option for you, we'd be happy to cancel your=
 subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br /><br />Let me know what=
 you think and if you have any questions on this, I'm happy to go over i=
t more with you. :)</span><br /></div><br>=0A        <br>--<br><table ce=
