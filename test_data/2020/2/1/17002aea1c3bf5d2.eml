Sorry, just realised I had not done this - but now I have. You should have
an invitation to apply which is linked to my internal referral. Seems the
point of getting you to suggest jobs is so I can steer you in the right
direction, you will have to select them (or others) when you apply.

I would not necessarily worry too much about the exact area, you can talk
through that with your recruiter when it gets to that - and do let me know
if you need any help with that, coz I can also talk to the recruiter!
