Chris,

A few things (and yes, I know I owe you a ton of email responses separate
from this!):

1) Peppercomm

The meeting today went well; they have a "purpose stress test" in which
they take the results of another agency's purpose analysis and do a bunch
of surveying to see if the customer can actually execute on that purpose.
They're interested in Indigo as a way to extend that and measure purpose
alignment ongoing.

One takeaway was that they liked that the qualitative data created a
feedback loop that automatically improved alignment, but they asked
specifically for case studies (this could be as simple as one paragraph of
outcomes per customer) and pricing. I gave the usual response that we were
specifically interested in purpose as a driver, so may be willing to
accommodate slightly on this. I'll loop back with my friend who got us the
invite and see where pricing might land best - can you pull together some
updated case studies, focused on outcomes? For context, they're currently
working with a client that's forcing them to use Towers Watson, and hate it.

2) Big Spaceship

I have a meeting next week; they may want to whitelabel Indigo for
innovation tracking/inculcation. I've been thinking for a while that we
need a brand revamp - do you think it's worth suggesting an exchange to
them? I.e., use it for free (i.e. keep all the profit) for 6 months in
exchange for the marketing collatoral?

3) Nikole

Spoke again with my friend on the west coast who has been doing L&D at
AirBnB. She's building our her own consultancy focused on offsites, but had
a TON of language about the platform that we just don't own yet. Stuff
around performance management (absolutely not us), where/how HR leaders are
more willing to work with CEO's on culture development, and how and when to
differentiate the platform. Out of everyone I've spoken to she's been the
most on-point for understanding what we do relative to the competition
along with how our clients may/may not respond to it.

We've known each other a long time, and there may be a chance for her to
whitelabel the platform just for herself in exchange for helping us develop
our marketing material and language to distinguish ourselves. She was very
clear that the space we're in is glutted with shitty competitors - I think
we've managed to miss a lot of that because we're coming in at a more
senior level, but suspect it may be a big part of why/how we're not
closing: because as Indigo goes down the vetting pipeline folks who have
seen dozens of similar things don't notice the difference and write it off.

Alternately, it also might be worth hiring her for a brief consult on how
to articulate our value prop (she's trained as an exec coach so I'm pretty
sure we'd get value from a short interview or two)

Thoughts?
- J
