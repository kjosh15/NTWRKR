Re-reviewed your edits and really liked the content (notsomuch the visuals,
TBH.) I'm really keen to find some specific examples that we can highlight
as stories to illustrate our main points - it seems like new shit keeps
popping up that does this for us, but if you could focus on how/what you
think best illustrates this on the Indigo side that'd be super helpful as
you've done most of the direct client engagement. Any thoughts?

All best,
Josh
