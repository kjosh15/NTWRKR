Hey Vikram! Hope you're doing well. Who should I pursue to get a "
discovery.com" link to Smart China and Game Vision? I need an "official"
link for Wikipedia.

Feel free to point me at whoever is best, and do update me on your latest
and greatest - always happy to help if I can! Most of my work these days is
on retainer to senior executives for large multinationals, which keeps me
busy with all the latest tech. Loads of fun.

All best,
Josh
