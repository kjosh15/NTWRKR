Apologies for the delay on this; my first thought was to wait and see what
(if anything) came from my friend at Transformative Institute - they're in
the process of creating content and need a framework to do it in. But given
that Rivel's legal agreement with us is about to end I suppose there's no
harm in getting the ball rolling there if they're willing. My only concern
is that they'll see their efforts as being entirely proprietary - just so
you know my thinking in advance, if they want to keep their content private
that's ok, but measuring the impact of content (and improving our system's
ability to do so more effectively) has to stay ours. Yes?
