Hello Josh, SXSW is almost here! I wanted to take a moment to bring a few
things to your attention.

1. Just a reminder that here is the link to your session line:
https://schedule.sxsw.com/2020/events/PP98902. Please make sure that the
title and description REALLY look the way you want. While we can't really
change the title since information has been pulled for on site signage, you
can still tweak the description. Also, if there are anyone speakers that
still need to add (or change out) a headshot or bio, this is the time to do
it. Reminder that headshots and bio updates are done by the speaker
through SXSW
Social <https://social.sxsw.com/>.

2. When you have a moment, please log back into your Session Production
Guide, and go to the TECHNICAL tab. There will find updated information
regarding the stage and A/V set up as well as exact location of your green
room.

3. Also, if you are considering video recording your session, you will need
to go through the SXSW Content Capture department to organize this.
Deadline to request the ability to bring a videographer with you is *Friday,
February 14*. More information on this can also be found on the TECHNICAL
tab of the Session Production Guide.

4. Lastly, in an effort to reduce waste during the conference, SXSW will
not have name placards for speakers this year. I encourage you to create a
digital slide of the speaker(s) on your session, to be shown and the
beginning and end (or for the duration if you do not intend to have a
presentation). SXSW is providing a template for you to use. This is
completely optional, but just in case you wanted a guideline, feel free to
use this.

Thanks so much, and let me know if you have any additional questions.

Conference Speaker Assistant
