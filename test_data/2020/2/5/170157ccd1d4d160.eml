More photos (and similar to the one by the plant) are available here:

Unfortunately almost all of my work is for corporate audiences who don't
let me share content - most of the time I'm presenting custom research and
content they'd rather not share. :/

8-11th October in Belgium sounds good to me - I'm free. Let me know what
else I can do to help!
