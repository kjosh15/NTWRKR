Here's what I came away from our meeting with:

1. Josh to introduce David and Ayesha
2. David to introduce Josh to Nick for us to meet and make a deck for Cardi
B
3. David to introduce Josh to Arcadi Freedman to get an estimate of pilot
for Microtargeting
4. David to introduce Josh and Jeremy in March to see about him taking the
reigns on any effort with Ayesha/Cardi B/Biden.

At this point you're not able to participate in any of these activities,
but are happy to be an advisor to any/all of them and have tapped
(Nick/Arcadi/Jeremy) as talent to fill your role.

Let me know if I've missed anything. Looking forward!

- J
