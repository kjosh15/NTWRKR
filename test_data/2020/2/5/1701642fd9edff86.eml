Many thanks, Ken!! I've attached my presskit so you can get an idea, and
you're of course welcome to check out www.josh.is for the long-standing
site I've been using (the new one is currently under construction.) If you
get any speaking gigs hit me up for a template to use - there are a lot of
gotchas I recommend you avoid!!

All best,
Josh
