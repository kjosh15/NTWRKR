Hot damn, this guy is amazing! Yes, please do introduce:

"We've developed a platform to create statistical models of human behavior
that are peer-to-peer created and designed to assist individuals in
understanding how and where to focus their efforts to be more successful
within their organization. Much more than a 360 review, we're aiming at
changing how work is done by supporting *everyone* in determining what
their company means and how it should act."

Let me know if he's interested, and thanks again!

All best,
Josh
