I would be happy to chat. I may not be of immediate or obvious assistance a=

Happy new year!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m writing as one of my new year&#39;s resolutions is to work more wit=
h people I admire, and not at all with assholes. The latter is pretty strai=
ghtforward to implement, with the pleasant side effect that I have more tim=
e for the former...<br>
<br>
I wanted to set a time for a short call in the coming weeks to see how/if w=
e can help each other this year. I&#39;m spending increasing time coaching =
high value talent on innovation strategy and new tech, doing direct advisin=
g on same to both startups and executive boards, and of course have a few f=
un projects running on the side (a psychometrics SaaS platform measuring cu=
lture, an IoT Wellness lab, and an AI for networking project among others!)=
<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have a half hour to talk and tell me what you&#39;re bui=
lding in 2019!<br>
<br>
All best wishes,<br>
Josh<br>
