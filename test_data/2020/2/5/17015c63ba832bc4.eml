Caught up with Steve today, became clear that he has a different perspective
to me on IndigoMetrics - would be good to discuss:

 

*	His view is that Indigo is not about behaviour change
*	What we are doing is measuring soft skills / behaviours. Over time
companies will incorporate these metrics into their incentive structures.
*	Because these metrics are in their incentive structures employees
will start to focus on them and change the behaviours


*	Without thinking about it and mostly due to impatience I have
increasingly started to think about Indigo's goal as behaviour change
*	On the basis that there isn't any point highlighting a training /
skills improvement need if you don't also provide a pathway to improve that
skill
*	And that you can't include our metrics in an incentive structure
unless you are also providing an individual with a pathway to improve those
metrics
*	And companies are not going to create these pathways other than by
hiring experts, which we know to only effective in relation to less than 20%
of individuals 

 

So on that basis he doesn't see much link with the targeted digital /
sub-conscious behaviour change project we have been discussing and he thinks
that we should do that away from Indigo in order to keep Indigo clean from
an ethics perspective in order to not scare off corporate customers.

 

Think I agree with him in that it makes sense to keep Indigo clean - and to
try and do the targeted digital stuff under a different banner - apart from
maybe a few well controlled projects such as the Exxon safety pitch.

 

I'm going to draft a different presentation for him to push to JLL based on
the above approach.

 

C
