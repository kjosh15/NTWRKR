I don't know what your needs are, but in developing a technology strategy
for a design firm here in NYC it became clear that there is plenty of room
to connect senior leaders with a design consultancy that can actually
deliver working technology. My background includes a strong network of such
leaders, as well as a decent media platform, and I'm curious if a firm like
yours would be a good fit for developing business relationships and playing
a role in creating solid, insightful solutions for clients.

Let me know if that helps and/or if I can clarify further!
