Perfect! If you can end my subscription in a way that keeps my account so I
have the option to resubscribe in the future and gain access back to my
budget data that would be great. A prorated refund would also be helpful -
that way I can check back in later to see if this issue is fixed.

Many thanks,
Josh

                <div>Hey Josh,<br><br>Since these reauthorization settings =
are <strong>determined completely by Capital One and their security protoco=
ls, we can&#39;t estimate if or when they&#39;ll change them</strong> to al=
low for easier access to your data. I know that&#39;s not the answer you we=
re looking for, but I want to be clear so that you can make the best choice=
 for your budgeting situation.<br><br>If these frequent reauthorizations ar=
e too burdensome and you decide to end your subscription, I completely unde=
rstand. But if you&#39;d like to try out some of our <a href=3D"https://doc=
s.youneedabudget.com/article/32-adding-transactions" target=3D"_blank">alte=
rnate transaction entry methods</a> that will help you automate your accoun=
ts while relying less on CapOne&#39;s connectivity, I wanted to share my bu=
dgeting workflow in case it would be helpful for you:<br><ol><li>I&#39;ve c=
reated <a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/165-scheduled-tran=
sactions" target=3D"_blank"><strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong></a> for=
 recurring or predictable transactions like my paycheck, rent, utilities, i=
nsurances, subscriptions like Netflix, etc. I set the date and frequency of=
 the transaction once and YNAB automatically enters them at those intervals=
 for me.</li><li>I use our <strong>mobile app</strong> to record spending w=
hile I&#39;m out. This one&#39;s always been hard to remember for me, so I =
keep myself disciplined by entering a transaction as soon as a cashier hand=
s me the receipt, before I put it in my wallet.</li><li><a href=3D"http://d=
ocs.youneedabudget.com/article/173-file-based-import" target=3D"_blank"><st=
rong>File-Based Importing</strong></a> fills in any gaps where I might&#39;=
ve missed a transaction during the week.</li><li>I <strong><a href=3D"https=
://www.youneedabudget.com/video-courses/using-your-ynab-budget/lesson-3/uni=
t-3/#course-player" target=3D"_blank">reconcile my accounts</a> </strong>at=
 least once a week, which ensures that their balances are 100% accurate and=
 that no missing, incorrect, duplicate, or uncleared transactions have slip=
ped through the cracks in the last few days.</li></ol><br>That routine keep=
s me in my budget about <strong>5 minutes a day</strong> between my Capital=
 One and USAA accounts, <em>maybe</em> 10 minutes if I&#39;m reconciling al=
l four individual accounts at once. With this method of active-entry, your =
budget will be <em>more</em> up to date than if you rely solely on Capital =
One to import your transactions, and will lead to heightened awareness and =
prioritization over your spending &amp; saving. It&#39;s worked well for me=
, so I hope you&#39;ll give it a shot if you&#39;d like to keep using YNAB =
and the YNAB Method. <br><br>Let me know if you have any additional questio=
