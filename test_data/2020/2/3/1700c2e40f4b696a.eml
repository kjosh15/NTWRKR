Ellie,

Pleasure speaking with you earlier - as ever, you cut through any ambiguity
and proposed immediate, useful next actions: brilliant. To that end, please
find my CV and presskit attached, and here is a short summary of what I'm
looking for:

---

For the past seven years I've been consulting to senior executives on
technology and innovation strategy (both on retainer and via special
projects), but now that my kids are both going to school full time I'm keen
to capitalize on the assets I've built and work with a smart team to create
real impact.

I'm looking for either A) a consultancy touching numerous technology /
innovation projects (I've worked with IDEO in the past, for example), or B)
a major corporation that can make real progress around AI/Big Data,
HealthTech / MedTech, or their own New/Emerging tech portfolio.

That said, I need to keep some of my time focused on my retainer work
(having a couple hundred Fortune 400-level executives calling you every
time they have a technology question is a very unique window!) as well as
advising my human behavior quantification and development startup
(IndigoMetrics.com), and leveraging my media profile (6-12 speaking events
per year at places like SXSW, TED, Davos, etc., three books and three TV
series over the last few years, etc. etc.).

---

Let me know what your internal contacts on the US side make of me, and in
the meantime I'll work on the update to my site and LinkedIn profile. Be in
touch!

Many thanks,
Josh
