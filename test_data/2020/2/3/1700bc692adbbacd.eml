 reauthorization settings are <strong>determined completely by Capital O=
ne and their security protocols, we can't estimate if or when they'll ch=
ange them</strong> to allow for easier access to your data. I know that'=
s not the answer you were looking for, but I want to be clear so that yo=
u can make the best choice for your budgeting situation.<br /><br />If t=
hese frequent reauthorizations are too burdensome and you decide to end=
 your subscription, I completely understand. But if you'd like to try ou=
t some of our <a href=3D"https://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/32-addi=
ng-transactions">alternate transaction entry methods</a> that will help=
 you automate your accounts while relying less on CapOne's connectivity,=
 I wanted to share my budgeting workflow in case it would be helpful for=
 you:<br /><ol><li>I've created <a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.co=
m/article/165-scheduled-transactions"><strong>Scheduled Transactions</st=
rong></a> for recurring or predictable transactions like my paycheck, re=
nt, utilities, insurances, subscriptions like Netflix, etc. I set the da=
te and frequency of the transaction once and YNAB automatically enters t=
hem at those intervals for me.</li><li>I use our <strong>mobile app</str=
ong> to record spending while I'm out. This one's always been hard to re=
member for me, so I keep myself disciplined by entering a transaction as=
 soon as a cashier hands me the receipt, before I put it in my wallet.</=
li><li><a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/173-file-based-=
import"><strong>File-Based Importing</strong></a> fills in any gaps wher=
e I might've missed a transaction during the week.</li><li>I <strong><a=
 href=3D"https://www.youneedabudget.com/video-courses/using-your-ynab-bu=
dget/lesson-3/unit-3/#course-player">reconcile my accounts</a> </strong>=
at least once a week, which ensures that their balances are 100% accurat=
e and that no missing, incorrect, duplicate, or uncleared transactions h=
ave slipped through the cracks in the last few days.</li></ol><br />That=
 routine keeps me in my budget about <strong>5 minutes a day</strong> be=
tween my Capital One and USAA accounts, <em>maybe</em> 10 minutes if I'm=
 reconciling all four individual accounts at once. With this method of a=
ctive-entry, your budget will be <em>more</em> up to date than if you re=
ly solely on Capital One to import your transactions, and will lead to h=
eightened awareness and prioritization over your spending &amp; saving.=
 It's worked well for me, so I hope you'll give it a shot if you'd like=
 to keep using YNAB and the YNAB Method. <br /><br />Let me know if you=
 have any additional questions! <br /></div><br>=0A        <br>--<br><ta=

h we did =F0=9F=98=85) <strong>it's expected that they'll prompt you to=

nts</a> on Saturday night and know there won't be any new transactions t=
o import when you check your budget Sunday morning, you don't need to re=
authorize the connection that time. <br /><br />As for when this might c=
hange...Capital One didn't share any announcements when they put these p=
rotocols in place, so I'm not very hopeful that they'll announce when th=
ey might change again. As a customer I wish they'd give us the option to=
 control our <em>own</em> account security settings, but after digging i=
