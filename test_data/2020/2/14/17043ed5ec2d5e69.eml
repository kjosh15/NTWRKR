An old contact who's developed an SaaS for supply chain solution had some
extensive intelligence community experience; given our conversations with
my friend Rachel I pushed for her feedback, with the below as a result.
Food for thought!

Re: the government deployment, there is no way on God=E2=80=99s green earth=
 that
the product will be approved for use on anything except government
infrastructure, which for this customer means C2S, the classified AWS
cloud. C2S has, to put it mildly, some quirks. But a relatively simple
system shouldn=E2=80=99t run into technical limitations on core services.

To get this done, you=E2=80=99ll need a pro services partner that is alread=
y
on-site and cleared to deploy software. You=E2=80=99ll need some basic soft=
ware
assurance running continuously (i.e. live state knowledge on codebase
vulnerabilities), which Ion Channel can provide. You could also benefit
from deployment into a C2S emulator, which Sequoia Combine runs, so that
when you deploy the system into a copy of C2S you can see the little places
where it breaks (mostly because it=E2=80=99s calling out to the Internet, w=
hich
isn=E2=80=99t possible on C2S) - that saves time and cost, because it elimi=
nates
(most of) the telephone game of tickets about why something=E2=80=99s not w=
orking
on a network you don=E2=80=99t have access to. All of this can (and should)=
 be
priced into your proposal.

Nothing that touches agency personnel, anonymized or not, will ever run on
commercial SaaS. Given that, your folks need to do cost-benefit on whether
it=E2=80=99s worth winning this opportunity. I can make the intro to the de=
ployment
experts, if you still want to go forward.

Thanks for this! I can already think of a few people to pass this to. Can
you follow up with an email contextualizing this for small, medium, and
large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and some with the
former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is a new target
for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).


The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterprise with a
large supplier network - is third party risk management: How do I get a
basic level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise,
particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a
continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green today=
 might
be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app that your web age=
ncy
developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some venture-backed
startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about security).

How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliverables (and their
updates) developed outside your boundary?

How do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so that suppliers are
on the hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabilities emerge?

How does this become a tractable process for procurement and vendor
management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber forensics that they=
=E2=80=99re not
staffed to take on?

This is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and
meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as
known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance policies.

An example:

1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services app development or vendor
product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Governance criteria are
enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibited components lists -
if you have certain Python libraries in your product (containing malware,
per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell that product to JP Morg=
an Chase
- it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procurement. One of the big banks requires an =
SBOM for
full pricing - any product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if
it gets procured at all.

2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to whatever
the supplier is doing for assurance.

3) If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical
vulnerability), that change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - security
SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has to push an update
that remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stamp with third party
certification that the supplier has met the provision or not, in which case
there might be remedies.



Does this make sense?



JC



Separately, any thinking you may have on how to propose a workable
deployment with gov't would be hugely appreciated.

Sincerely,
Josh
