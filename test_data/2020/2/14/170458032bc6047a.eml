I've been getting feedback that I need CEO in my resume *somewhere* to
continue some of the conversations I'm having around new gigs and potential
board seats. I think we'd both agree that hat is firmly on your head at the
moment, but was wondering how you felt about my putting it down for myself
for the first year or two of Indigo's existance. Yes, it's just a resume
buff, but I don't wan't to do anything you're not comfortable with.
Thoughts?
