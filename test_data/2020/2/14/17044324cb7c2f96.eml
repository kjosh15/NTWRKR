Site (www.josh.is) is probably the best bet, although I've attached my
presskit in case it proves useful. For a bio:

"Josh Klein started hacking and cracking in middle school, worked on the
first e-commerce engine, the US Telco infrastructure, and one of the first
distributed medical analytics systems. He's spoken at TED, Davos, SXSW, and
in front of audiences worldwide, as well as published three books and
hosted three tv series on technology innovation. Now he spends most of his
time consulting to senior level executives on technology and innovation
strategy."

As for World 50, they're a private organization for C-Suite Executives to
connect and collaborate across industry or sector. Most of their members
(IMHO) are from major companies (Fortune 400 or above.)

Let me know what else I can tell you - really really appreciate it!

        Dawn,
        <br>
        <br>Thanks again for meeting yesterday. I'm enormously grateful for=
 the time and attention and can't overstate how much I appreciate your pers=
pective. You've definitely got a uniquely valuable view of the NY Tech Scen=
e!!
        <br>
        <br>I'll bring you up in my next call w/ World 50, but wanted to ga=
uge your interest in working with senior leaders to tour them around differ=
ent aspects of the NYC tech Ecosystem. Is this something that you're keen t=
o monetize, is it a nice bonus from a networking perspective, or is it more=
 of a favor to me?
        <br>
        <br>Secondly, you'd mentioned a couple people I was curious about:
        <br>
        <br>1. Catherine at Bloomberg. You'd suggested she has a ton of inf=
o about smart cities (they issue reports). If it may be useful for her to c=
ollaborate with my executive contacts I'd love to connect with her.
        <br>
        <br>2. Matt at Grand Central Tech sounds like a super interesting c=
ontact, both on the psychometrics side and the Commercial Real Estate (micr=
otargeting) approach. Do you think he'd be willing to connect?
        <br>
        <br>I'll check out Flatiron Health and First Round's healthcare wor=
k in the meantime. I'm curious to see what comes next, and as ever please d=
o let me know if I can ever be of help. As you suggested, I'm here for you!=
