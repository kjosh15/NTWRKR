Steven,

Spoke to Megan and was hoping for a quick fix, but no luck (as per the most
recent thread I cc'd you on). We'll see what they suggest next. In the
meantime, some notes:

Registration - You don't need this as Packages page ought to auto guide
them to register

Schedule - Pick-a-spot should show up after you pick a date on the schedule
iframe

Instructors List - Best they can do is include a link from the bottom of
each instructor's profile to a page like this:
https://www.fitmetrix.io/WebPortal/InstructorDetail/1a72bd3e-2d44-ea11-aa59-d942907bbf75?InstructorID=388291&locationID=15416&includenonreservable=1

Will keep pushing on making the existing inserts look good; let me know
what else you need on the above pieces beforehand.

- J
