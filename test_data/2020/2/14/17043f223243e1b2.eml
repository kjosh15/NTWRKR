Victor,

Pleasure meeting with you yesterday - it was good to speak with someone
else in the process of figuring out a new transition!

Two requests:

1. Can you send me a one-liner on the kinds of introductions or
opportunities I could keep my ears open about for you? Our conversation was
brief, and I want to make sure I'm watching for the right things.

2. If possible, I'd still really like to connect with your friend at Fjord.
I think there's real potential to do interesting things at Accenture, but
need to connect at the right level. Let me know how I can support this!

Many thanks - let's stay in touch!

- J
