Cool =E2=80=93 thanks =E2=80=93 I have fixed the top one =E2=80=93 just =

I have added the others to the =E2=80=9Cpotential spend=E2=80=9D list =
=E2=80=93 which is actually quite short at the moment.

I don=E2=80=99t have anything planned for March software changes yet =

passing them over for you to dismiss was better than something being =
missed.
