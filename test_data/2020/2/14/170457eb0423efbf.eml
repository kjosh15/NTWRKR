Parastou,

So good to catch up!! Very glad you're out there in the world; it's so
exciting to hear about the meaningful work you're doing around Yoga! I'm
particularly stoked to share the images you sent me with my son - he's
super visual and I think he'll really love them.

Separately, you'd suggested you could introduce me to Bill Hughes and
Nathan King at Accenture. Here's a short bio:

"Josh Klein has worked with roughly half of the Fortune 200, focused on
technology innovation strategy. His last three books and three tv series
have all focused on this same topic, and his talks have been heard at
venues like TED, Davos, and SXSW as well as at private events around the
world. For more information, please see www.josh.is."

If there's anything else I can do to facilitate just ask - I really
appreciate the intro!!

Finally, as I understand it you're looking for Product Strategy and UX
Designer opportunities - you called it UX Strategy, which I think is just
brilliant. Let me know if you want an intro to Big Spaceship, or if there's
anything else I can help with!!

All best wishes and stay in touch,
Josh
