Thanks for this! I can already think of a few people to pass this to. Can
you follow up with an email contextualizing this for small, medium, and
large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and some with the
former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is a new target
for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).

Separately, any thinking you may have on how to propose a workable
deployment with gov't would be hugely appreciated.

Sincerely,
Josh
