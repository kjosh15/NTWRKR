Arkady,

Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked to hear your questions and am
excited to see if we can all get some answers. Here's the use case we want
to try to prove:

- We provide a name, address (likely an office), email address, and phone
- We can get the target to click on a link
- We can provide a dummy URL to use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward
or private page via a log-in

Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd like to see evidence of:

- >10 legitimate impressions within a two week timespan
- ability to self destruct the cookie after a certain period of time
- any additional tracking data on the target

This would likely be deployed in the US or UK. Again, if we're able to
prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was for $1-2k to demonstrate
feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a client to partner with
where we could scale quickly and privately. To that end please do keep an
eye out for larger business implications, potential cost savings, benefits
of scale, etc.

Thanks so much!
Josh
