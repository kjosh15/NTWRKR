Hope all is well with you too! What are you up to these days?? I've been
dabbling in microtargeting (to understand how high-value individuals are
likely to be targeted) and considering next moves - now that the kids are
both going to school full time I'm itching to dig into something
significant. Any ideas?

We didn't end up doing the RV trip this summer; we're looking to go with my
brother-in-law and his family, which adds to the logistics as they're based
in Iceland. Right now it's looking like a 2021 plan. ;-)

I haven't about the summit yet. If you get confirmation will you let me
know?
