twgr%5Eauthor>
at company <https://www.company.co/about-us/>. maybe you should send me a
very brief recent bio...? or should i just link to your site here
<http://www.josh.is/writing/>? you tell me... also brief something on world
50? or maybe they've already heard of it...? anyway, you let me know...

you're so kind to think of me for working with your world 50 senior people
- sure! would love to! both from networking standpoint (always good for me
to know people) and if $ is involved even better... but i'd always do as a
favor for you too, if it helps you...
