This is so super interesting... would be curious to hear more about how you
see us connecting this qualitative data to the statistical models we
already have.

I wouldn=E2=80=99t mind seeing them more frequently too.

I find it awkward to answer this question.

If someone is already a high performer on an action statement and has
always been, I struggle with =E2=80=9Chow have they recently improved?=E2=
=80=9D

It came up Friday. I just passed.

The algorithm should recognize that I have always given that person =E2=80=
=9C4=E2=80=9D on
that action statement.

[Brian, our qualitative feedback to date is attached if you want to review
it=E2=80=A6]



Hi Chris,



I am happy enough for our high performers to get =E2=80=98pat on the back=
=E2=80=99
comments. These are our best people so if this is really just another
mechanism by which the company/their colleagues can show them appreciation
I am ok with that. While it would be better for them to get constructive
criticism so they can continue to improve, I=E2=80=99m not averse to what=
=E2=80=99s been
happening and wouldn=E2=80=99t want to drop it entirely for the high perfor=
mers.
The current language for people with good scores is =E2=80=9CPlease describ=
e how
##FIRSTNAME## has improved their performance in this area recently=E2=80=9D=
 and
definitely seeks to elicit what behaviors are being appreciated. I think
the resulting comments enforce what people think the reviewee is doing
well, e.g., [person] is very busy but is friendly, [person] is detail
oriented. I think the language of suggestion #2 below might reduce the pat
on the back comments and we=E2=80=99ll just get fewer overall. Maybe someth=
ing like
=E2=80=9CPlease describe how ##FIRSTNAME## has improved their performance i=
n this
area recently, and/or make a suggestion regarding how they can improve
further.=E2=80=9D



Also the feedback is tied to an action statement but on the attached report
we only see the value, so it=E2=80=99s a little hard to know what people ar=
e
commenting on =E2=80=93 it would be better to have the action statements on=
 this
report instead of the value. What do you think?

Theresa, Brian,

We have been looking at the algo that drives the qualitative feedback on
the platform and we=E2=80=99re wondering if you have a view on the issue be=
low:

The platform currently attempts to generate qualitative upskilling feedback
even for individuals with very high scores =E2=80=93 on the basis that we c=
an all
improve. However the text feedback entered in relation to high performers
often amounts to =E2=80=9CJane is already wonderful, there is no way that s=
he can
improve=E2=80=9D. >70% of text feedback entered for high performers is, in =
our
view, of low value.

As you have a few of these high performers at Rivel I was wondering if you
had a view as to the best way to proceed?:

   - We could simply not seek text feedback for high performers
   - We could change the question asked in relation to high performers to
   =E2=80=9CJohn is already a high performer in this area but if you can th=
ink of a
   way they can improve please enter it below=E2=80=9D (or similar). (Issue=
 with this
   approach is that it leads the feedback).
   - We could leave as is
   - We could try and think up a different way to generate useful feedback
   for the already high performers. Possibly driven by an expert system rat=
her
   than peer feedback.

All thoughts and ideas appreciated!

Chris

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-GB">The platform currently attempts=
 to generate qualitative upskilling feedback even for individuals with very=
 high scores =E2=80=93 on the basis that we can all improve. However the te=
xt feedback entered in relation to high performers
 often amounts to =E2=80=9CJane is already wonderful, there is no way that =
she can improve=E2=80=9D. &gt;70% of text feedback entered for high perform=
ers is, in our view, of low value.<u></u><u></u></span></p>
