Just got a rejection letter on the third opp I applied for; should I just
reapply for a new set of opps? I recognize that I'm not applying for
positions I'm specifically interested in but am eager to get through these
first hoops so we can dig in. Let me know if talking directly to a
recruiter would be more effective, or if you've got another avenue.

Can't stop thinking about the implications of distributed, private
computation - Coral.ai is one thing, but the logical extensions of that
kind of capacity from a cryptographic perspective are super interesting.
I'd love to engage with some of my business leader contacts around how
they'd be able to plan their own roadmaps to take market leading positions
accordingly, and the sorts of partnerships you could build - even with
really early stage capacity - that's just tantallizing!
