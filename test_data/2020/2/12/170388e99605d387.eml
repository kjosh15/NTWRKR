I find it awkward to answer this question.

If someone is already a high performer on an action statement and has =
always been, I struggle with =E2=80=9Chow have they recently =
improved?=E2=80=9D

It came up Friday. I just passed.

The algorithm should recognize that I have always given that person =
=E2=80=9C4=E2=80=9D on that action statement.

[Brian, our qualitative feedback to date is attached if you want to =
review it=E2=80=A6]

Hi Chris,

=20

I am happy enough for our high performers to get =E2=80=98pat on the =
back=E2=80=99 comments. These are our best people so if this is really =
just another mechanism by which the company/their colleagues can show =
them appreciation I am ok with that. While it would be better for them =
to get constructive criticism so they can continue to improve, =
I=E2=80=99m not averse to what=E2=80=99s been happening and =
wouldn=E2=80=99t want to drop it entirely for the high performers. The =
current language for people with good scores is =E2=80=9CPlease describe =
how ##FIRSTNAME## has improved their performance in this area =
recently=E2=80=9D and definitely seeks to elicit what behaviors are =
being appreciated. I think the resulting comments enforce what people =
think the reviewee is doing well, e.g., [person] is very busy but is =
friendly, [person] is detail oriented. I think the language of =
suggestion #2 below might reduce the pat on the back comments and =
we=E2=80=99ll just get fewer overall. Maybe something like =
=E2=80=9CPlease describe how ##FIRSTNAME## has improved their =
performance in this area recently, and/or make a suggestion regarding =
how they can improve further.=E2=80=9D

=20

Also the feedback is tied to an action statement but on the attached =
report we only see the value, so it=E2=80=99s a little hard to know what =
people are commenting on =E2=80=93 it would be better to have the action =
statements on this report instead of the value. What do you think?

Theresa, Brian,

We have been looking at the algo that drives the qualitative feedback on =
the platform and we=E2=80=99re wondering if you have a view on the issue =
below:

The platform currently attempts to generate qualitative upskilling =
feedback even for individuals with very high scores =E2=80=93 on the =
basis that we can all improve. However the text feedback entered in =
relation to high performers often amounts to =E2=80=9CJane is already =
wonderful, there is no way that she can improve=E2=80=9D. >70% of text =
feedback entered for high performers is, in our view, of low value.

As you have a few of these high performers at Rivel I was wondering if =
you had a view as to the best way to proceed?:

*	We could simply not seek text feedback for high performers=20
*	We could change the question asked in relation to high performers to =
=E2=80=9CJohn is already a high performer in this area but if you can =
think of a way they can improve please enter it below=E2=80=9D (or =
similar). (Issue with this approach is that it leads the feedback).
*	We could leave as is
*	We could try and think up a different way to generate useful feedback =
for the already high performers. Possibly driven by an expert system =
rather than peer feedback.

All thoughts and ideas appreciated!

Chris

our best people so if this is really just another mechanism by which the =

can continue to improve, I=E2=80=99m not averse to what=E2=80=99s been =
happening and wouldn=E2=80=99t want to drop it entirely for the high =

=E2=80=9CPlease describe how ##FIRSTNAME## has improved their =
performance in this area recently=E2=80=9D and definitely seeks to =
elicit what behaviors are being appreciated. I think the resulting =
comments enforce what people think the reviewee is doing well, e.g., =
[person] is very busy but is friendly, [person] is detail oriented. I =
think the language of suggestion #2 below might reduce the pat on the =
back comments and we=E2=80=99ll just get fewer overall. Maybe something =
