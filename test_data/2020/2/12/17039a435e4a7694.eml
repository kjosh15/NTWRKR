Greg,

Giving this one last shot; most of the work I've been doing over the last
few years has been advisory around tech and innovation strategy, mainly for
senior level executives. I'd love to have a brief call to see if I could be
additive to the work you're doing in this space. Let me know if you're game=
!

all best,
Josh
