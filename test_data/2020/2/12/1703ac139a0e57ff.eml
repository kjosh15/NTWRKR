I've got the code in place throughout the side (except on the instructor's
page) and an appointment with Megan for a call Friday. I've been pursuing
her via email since our earlier exchange but she's not providing anything
specific I can do - my take is that she doesn't want to examine the site
HTML or their iframe codes and so is punting me a couple days. I'll keep at
it, but for now that's where we are.

Let me know what else I can do to help in the meantime, if anything.
