The call yesterday was very timely as I recently met with a friend of mind
here in NY who is about as on-point for the tech investment and development
scene as anyone is possible to be. She founded NYTechMeetup and has been
working behind the scenes ever since, but is willing to setup a tour of all
the big spaces and players here in NYC if that's of interest to W50
members!

All best,
Josh
