Met with their CEO yesterday; they're looking to create an organizational
transformation capability as they're recognizing that culture is what their
clients are actually buying.

Also of note, did a call with about a dozen CTO/CIOs yesterday and they
universally quoted culture (and more specifically changing culture) as
their biggest challenge atm.
