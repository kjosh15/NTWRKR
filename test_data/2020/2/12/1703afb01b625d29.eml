> Thanks for this! I can already think of a few people to pass this to. =
Can you follow up with an email contextualizing this for small, medium, =
and large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and some with =
the former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is a new =
target for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).

The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterprise with a =
large supplier network - is third party risk management: How do I get a =
basic level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise, =
particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a =
continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green =
today might be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app =
that your web agency developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from =
some venture-backed startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass =
about security).=20

How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliverables (and =
their updates) developed outside your boundary?

How do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so that suppliers =
are on the hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabilities emerge?

How does this become a tractable process for procurement and vendor =
management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber forensics that =
they=E2=80=99re not staffed to take on?=20

This is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and =
meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as =
known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance policies.=20

An example:

1) The supplier deliverable (either pro services app development or =
vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurement. Governance =
criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have prohibited =
components lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your product =
(containing malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to sell =
that product to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to =
procurement. One of the big banks requires an SBOM for full pricing - =
any product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if it gets =
procured at all.

2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to =
whatever the supplier is doing for assurance.

3) If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical =
vulnerability), that change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - =
security SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has to push =
an update that remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stamp with =
third party certification that the supplier has met the provision or =
not, in which case there might be remedies.=20



Does this make sense?
