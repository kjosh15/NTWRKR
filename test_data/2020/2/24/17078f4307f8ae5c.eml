I think you=E2=80=99ve got a good grasp of what we=E2=80=99re trying to do;=
 let us know if
we=E2=80=99ve missed anything and/or what else they might be able to do in =
addition
to the higher hit rate. Again, we=E2=80=99re looking to change the behavior=
 of a
very small, prespecified group of people.

Thanks, Arkady!

                     It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it s=
tands now we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who w=

                     For example, the most likely case study is three diffe=
rent groups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content=
 (so 30-60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, =
phone #'s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that w=
ould point them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly a=
ffect them this project doesn't work.=20

                                  It's kind of doable through a DSP as stan=
dard retargeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impr=
essions and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in or=
der to maximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example =
a $200 CPM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                        Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward=
 on the DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards t=
he DSP side to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since=
 it's not proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since t=
hey're proven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole fu=

                                 But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. T=
here is no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to w=
ork with a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filt=
ering to minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 ou=
t of 10) impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                           What are average listening costs? If the ROI on =
getting the right impressions in front of the right people is high enough, =
listening costs may be negligible.&nbsp;

                        Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I=
 have with my DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I=
 can leverage extra account management as needed as long as there's some de=

                           IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a ce=
rtain place at a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building=
 with several thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardl=
y specific enough to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create imp=
act. Is that correct?

                        That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystac=
k (commercial building) will be very difficult, thats why we typically to L=
at Long and Day parting to reach a certain "audience" at a certain location=
 but not necessarily particular people.&nbsp; Again, it's not tested on spe=
cific people using DSP's and I'm not sure if it will 100% as effective and =
trackable as Influ2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                 I've been in touch with the founder of an =
interesting platform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few b=
rands in the US doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying=
 to move to the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platfor=
m does a secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Go=
ogle Ads on the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of t=
he individuals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to=
 score their engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pric=
ing is as follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The =
probability of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people=
 in your pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                           They certainly sound like they're selling what w=
e're looking for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge =
to get 10-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals=
 over the course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, =
b) what is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly ca=
n they prove it?

                        Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&=
nbsp; So if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you =
need more scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger =
percentage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them=
.&nbsp; Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus =
on the list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nb=

                                              <br>Pleasure speaking with yo=
u! Was stoked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all ge=
t some answers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                              <br>
                                              <br>- We provide a name, addr=
ess (likely an office), email address, and phone
                                              <br>- We can get the target t=
o click on a link
                                              <br>- We can provide a dummy =
URL to use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log=
-in
                                              <br>
                                              <br>Once the cookie has been =
dropped, we'd like to see evidence of:
                                              <br>
                                              <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impre=
ssions within a two week timespan
                                              <br>- ability to self destruc=
t the cookie after a certain period of time
                                              <br>- any additional tracking=
 data on the target
                                              <br>
                                              <br>This would likely be depl=
oyed in the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (ini=
tial RFP was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're lo=
oking for a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and private=
ly. To that end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications,=
 potential cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                              <br>
                                              <br>Thanks so much!
