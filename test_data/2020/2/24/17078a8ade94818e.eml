The effectiveness will really depend on the creatives that we run and where
we're targeting them.  If the creatives are spot on then obviously the
match rate will be higher.

We can see if there's a way to optimize this with a higher match rate on
the call with them tomorrow.

Please confirm if that time works for you.

Cheers,

Arkady

   The effectiveness will really depend on the creatives that we run and wh=
ere we're targeting them.&nbsp; If the creatives are spot on then obviously=
 the match rate will be higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

           It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now =
we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need to =
affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

           For example, the most likely case study is three different group=
s of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-60=
 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s,=
 and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would point=
 them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect them=
 this project doesn't work.=20

           On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals, th=
e ROI will be substantial.

                        It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retar=
geting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions an=
d limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to max=
imize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM=
. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                 What is a $200 CPM, and how would that result in spending =
less than $1.00 for an entire campaign?

              Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DS=
P side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP sid=
e to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not =
proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're pro=
ven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&nbsp=

                       But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no=
 guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a=
 small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to m=
inimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) i=
mpressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

              Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with=
 my DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can lever=
age extra account management as needed as long as there's some decent spend=
 happening on the DSP at least $3K per campaign per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                       The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's no=
t guaranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a bra=

                 IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain plac=
e at a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with seve=
ral thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific=
 enough to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is th=

              That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (commerc=

ecret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads o=
n the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individ=
uals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score the=
ir engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as =
follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probabilit=
y of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your p=
ool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                 They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looki=

15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the =

              Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So i=
f it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more =
scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage=
.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Ca=
n you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the lis=
t of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                    <br>
                                    <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was sto=
ked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some ans=
wers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>- We provide a name, address (likel=
y an office), email address, and phone
                                    <br>- We can get the target to click on=
 a link
                                    <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use=
, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, w=
e'd like to see evidence of:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions wit=
hin a two week timespan
                                    <br>- ability to self destruct the cook=
ie after a certain period of time
                                    <br>- any additional tracking data on t=
he target
                                    <br>
                                    <br>This would likely be deployed in th=
e US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP w=
as for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for =
a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To tha=
t end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential=
 cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Thanks so much!
