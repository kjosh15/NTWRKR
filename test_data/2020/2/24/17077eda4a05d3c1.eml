Hi Josh,

Please accept my profuse apologies for the delay in getting back to you on
all your great messages over the last few weeks. A few days after we
talked, everything exploded with the terrible job at Claremont. I've been
trying to fight raging wildfires ever since. To mix metaphors, it feels
like I'm not only surrounded by walls of flames, but also buried under an
avalanche, and also drowning in a tsunami.

It actually reminds me of your story about your stress, and how learning
about diabetes completely transformed everything. When we spoke on January
31, I told you how awful my job was, but I probably didn't yet have the
courage to make a move. But this crisis is pushing me to quit, much sooner
than I had imagined. (I was staying in the job mostly due to a sense of
integrity and obligation; I had committed to teach and to run programs
through the end of the summer, but was planning to leave by September 1.
Now it's likely I will leave by the end of next month, commitments be
damned!)

Long story short, I would love love love to have a quick follow-up call. I
am in all-day meetings today and tomorrow in Claremont (perhaps even to
announce my resignation), but then could talk on Wednesday, Thursday, or
Friday. What time might work for you?

Best,
Scott
