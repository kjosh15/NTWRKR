            It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now=
 we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need to=
 affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

            For example, the most likely case study is three different grou=
ps of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-6=
0 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s=
, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would poin=
t them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect the=
m this project doesn't work.=20

            On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals, t=
he ROI will be substantial.

                         It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard reta=
rgeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions a=
nd limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to ma=
ximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CP=
M. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

               Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the D=
SP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP si=
de to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not=
 proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're pr=
oven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&nbs=

                        But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is n=
o guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with =
a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to =
minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) =
impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

               Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have wit=

                        The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's n=

                  IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain pla=

to the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a =
secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads =
on the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the indivi=
duals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score th=
eir engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as=
 follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probabili=
ty of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your =
pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                  They certainly sound like they're selling what we're look=

-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the=

               Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So =
if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more=
 scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentag=

an you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the li=

                                     <br>
                                     <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was st=
oked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some an=
swers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                     <br>
                                     <br>- We provide a name, address (like=
ly an office), email address, and phone
                                     <br>- We can get the target to click o=
n a link
                                     <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to us=
e, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                     <br>
                                     <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, =
we'd like to see evidence of:
                                     <br>
                                     <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions wi=
thin a two week timespan
                                     <br>- ability to self destruct the coo=
kie after a certain period of time
                                     <br>- any additional tracking data on =
the target
                                     <br>
                                     <br>This would likely be deployed in t=
he US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP =
was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for=
 a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To th=
at end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potentia=
l cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                     <br>
                                     <br>Thanks so much!
