Good points, and agreed across the board. Guess we get to figure this =
out quickly as he wants to talk Wednesday. I know you're nominally on =
vacation; did you want to break silence on Monday, and/or did you have =
any further thoughts we could exchange via email?

Just spoke to a contact at LinkedIn; he's going to introduce me to their =
team in business development as well as someone who did a big project =
there around purpose driven organizations. I'm working on how to present =
Indigo as distinct from our competitors, but in the meantime he brought =
up https://www.glintinc.com/ which is worth another look - they've =
really expanded their service offerings, how they describe their impact, =
the portfolio of features, etc. This is what we're competing with, and a =
LOT of it is just language. I think we could update both our decks and =
our site if we wanted to invest in the marketing effort... but am =
equally concerned about what we're losing if we don't. Thoughts?
