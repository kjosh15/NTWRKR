I would be happy to chat. I may not be of immediate or obvious assistance as=
 I quit my job at Generali, for reasons exactly like your resolution. We ret=

I'm writing as one of my new year's resolutions is to work more with people I=
 admire, and not at all with assholes. The latter is pretty straightforward t=

I wanted to set a time for a short call in the coming weeks to see how/if we=
 can help each other this year. I'm spending increasing time coaching high v=

 IoT Wellness lab, and an AI for networking project among others!)<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have a half hour to talk and tell me what you're building=
 in 2019!<br>

All best wishes,<br>
