               It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands =
now we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need=
 to affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

              <div>
               For example, the most likely case study is three different g=
roups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 3=
0-60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone =
#'s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would p=
oint them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect =
them this project doesn't work.=20

               On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individuals=
, the ROI will be substantial.

                            It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard r=
etargeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impression=
s and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to=
 maximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200=
 CPM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                  Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on th=
e DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP=
 side to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's =
not proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're=
 proven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&=

                           But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There i=
s no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work wi=
th a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering =
to minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 1=
0) impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                  Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have =

                           The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it'=

                     IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain =

 a secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google A=

ividuals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score=
 their engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is=
 as follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probab=
ility of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in yo=
ur pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                     They certainly sound like they're selling what we're l=
ooking for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get=
 10-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over =
the course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) wha=
t is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they=
 prove it?

                  Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; =
So if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need m=
ore scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percen=
tage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp=
; Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the=
 list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                        Arkady,
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was=
 stoked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some=
 answers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>- We provide a name, address (l=
ikely an office), email address, and phone
                                        <br>- We can get the target to clic=
k on a link
                                        <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to=
 use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Once the cookie has been droppe=
d, we'd like to see evidence of:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions=
 within a two week timespan
                                        <br>- ability to self destruct the =
cookie after a certain period of time
                                        <br>- any additional tracking data =
on the target
                                        <br>
                                        <br>This would likely be deployed i=
n the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial R=
FP was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking =
for a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To=
 that end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, poten=
tial cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Thanks so much!
                                        <br>Josh
