                   It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it sta=
nds now we're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we =
need to affect with a guarenteed level of impact.=20

                  <div>
                   For example, the most likely case study is three differe=
nt groups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (=
so 30-60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, ph=
one #'s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that wou=
ld point them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly aff=
ect them this project doesn't work.=20

                  <div>
                   On the up side, if we *can* reach those specific individ=
uals, the ROI will be substantial.

                                It's kind of doable through a DSP as standa=
rd retargeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impres=
sions and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in orde=
r to maximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a =
$200 CPM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

n the DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the=
 DSP side to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since i=

                               But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. The=
re is no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to wor=
k with a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filter=
ing to minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out =
of 10) impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

stening costs may be negligible.&nbsp;

                               I've been in touch with the founder of an in=
teresting platform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few bra=
nds in the US doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying t=
o move to the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform =
does a secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Goog=
le Ads on the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the=
 individuals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to s=
core their engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricin=
g is as follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The pr=
obability of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people i=
n your pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                         They certainly sound like they're selling what we'=
re looking for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to=
 get 10-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals o=
ver the course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b)=
 what is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can =
they prove it?

                      Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nb=
sp; So if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you ne=
ed more scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger pe=
rcentage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&=
nbsp; Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on=
 the list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp=

                                            Arkady,
                                            <br>
                                            <br>Pleasure speaking with you!=
 Was stoked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get =
some answers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                            <br>
                                            <br>- We provide a name, addres=
s (likely an office), email address, and phone
                                            <br>- We can get the target to =
click on a link
                                            <br>- We can provide a dummy UR=
L to use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-i=
n
                                            <br>
                                            <br>Once the cookie has been dr=
opped, we'd like to see evidence of:
                                            <br>
                                            <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impress=
ions within a two week timespan
                                            <br>- ability to self destruct =
the cookie after a certain period of time
                                            <br>- any additional tracking d=
ata on the target
                                            <br>
                                            <br>This would likely be deploy=
ed in the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initi=
al RFP was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're look=
ing for a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately=
. To that end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, p=
otential cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>Thanks so much!
