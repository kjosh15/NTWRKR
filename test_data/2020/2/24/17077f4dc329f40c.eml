                 It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stand=

                 For example, the most likely case study is three different=
 groups of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so=
 30-60 *total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phon=
e #'s, and working addresses, and could easily send them content that would=
 point them to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affec=
t them this project doesn't work.=20

                              It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard=
 retargeting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressi=
ons and limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order =
to maximize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $2=
00 CPM. The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

                    Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on =
the DSP side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the D=
SP side to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it'=
s not proven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they'=
re proven with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel=

                             But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There=
 is no guarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work =
with a small number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filterin=
g to minimize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of=
 10) impressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                    That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (c=
ommercial building) will be very difficult, thats why we typically to Lat L=
ong and Day parting to reach a certain "audience" at a certain location but=
 not necessarily particular people.&nbsp; Again, it's not tested on specifi=
c people using DSP's and I'm not sure if it will 100% as effective and trac=
kable as Influ2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                             I've been in touch with the founder of an inte=
resting platform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brand=
s in the US doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to =
move to the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform do=
es a secret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google=
 Ads on the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the i=
ndividuals you need to target and creatives and then they will start to sco=
re their engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing =
is as follows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The prob=
ability of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in =
your pool the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                       They certainly sound like they're selling what we're=
 looking for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to g=
et 10-15 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals ove=
r the course of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) w=
hat is their confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can th=
ey prove it?

                    Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp=
; So if it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need=
 more scale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger perc=
entage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nb=
sp; Can you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on t=
he list of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                          <br>Pleasure speaking with you! W=
as stoked to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get so=
me answers. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                          <br>
                                          <br>- We provide a name, address =
(likely an office), email address, and phone
                                          <br>- We can get the target to cl=
ick on a link
                                          <br>- We can provide a dummy URL =
to use, either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                          <br>
                                          <br>Once the cookie has been drop=
ped, we'd like to see evidence of:
                                          <br>
                                          <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressio=
ns within a two week timespan
                                          <br>- ability to self destruct th=
e cookie after a certain period of time
                                          <br>- any additional tracking dat=
a on the target
                                          <br>
                                          <br>This would likely be deployed=
 in the US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial=
 RFP was for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're lookin=
g for a client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. =
To that end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, pot=
ential cost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                          <br>
                                          <br>Thanks so much!
