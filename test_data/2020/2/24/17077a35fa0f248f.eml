This looks great! Only thing I would change would be to put a (very short)
summary slide echoing the "why it works" slide, but up front (slide 2 or 3
or so). I.e., highlight what we're going to do, why it's unique and
effective, and THEN explain why it's so critical, how it works, etc. etc.
before echoing why it works in more detail.

David?
