Ha!! I always love to hear from Bruce as he thought I was 3ric's brother
for the longest time... Glad to see they have a serious stove.

Induction is not flame, that's true, but holy shit does it give you quick
temp control. Plus if you get the right cookware I've found it has the most
even cooking surface I've ever worked with. Maybe my problem is living with
rental stoves which constantly leak... :/

Keep me posted on the recruiter front - I'm keen to get over the hoop
jumping and into an NDA so we can talk about real work stat!!
