This is hilarious - especially as a United States citizen, and doubly so as
a New Yorker. The ad is great; "cool stuff comes from everywhere and we've
made it our own." Congratulations, and also so what? Am I supposed to be
upset that my famous New York Pizza is originally from Italy? This is just
the history (and success) of the human race - we adapt, recombine, and
advance, together.

Thanks for the update!

best,
Josh

P.S. You cc'd everyone on this list, meaning I now have a mailing list of
people you've worked with. Best case scenario, this exposes all of us to a
lot more spam (spam engines collect lists like this.) Worst case it gives
bad actors people to target. Use bcc! :)
