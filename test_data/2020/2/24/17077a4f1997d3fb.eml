OK, thanks for the update. I think that's too small to be effective, but

         It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now we=
're likely to have a much *smaller* list than 100 people, who we need to af=

         For example, the most likely case study is three different groups =
of 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-60 *=
total*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s, a=
nd working addresses, and could easily send them content that would point t=
hem to a specific website. However, if we can't significantly affect them t=
his project doesn't work.=20

                      It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retarge=
ting. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and =
limited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maxim=
ize the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. =
The spend on each campaign will be below $1.

            Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DSP =
side.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP side =
to try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not pr=
oven.&nbsp; I would put the bulk on the platform Influ2 since they're prove=
n with big clients and have a UI in place to track the whole funnel.&nbsp; =

                     But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no g=
uarantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a s=
mall number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to min=
imize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) imp=
ressions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

                     The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not =
guaranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a brand=

strategy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business=

               IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place =
at a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with severa=

                     I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting =
platform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brands in the=
 US doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to move to =
the US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a sec=
ret marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on =
the open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individua=
ls you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their=
 engagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as fo=
llows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability =
of reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your poo=
l the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                   </div>This is the approximate net cost from them, we cou=

                   I've attached a spreadsheet that illustrates the scale a=

 capabilities deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  <div>
                   I'm very interested in partnering with them for future p=
rojects or potentially being a partner for marketing of their services in t=
he US.&nbsp; &nbsp;For this project, I'd like to be involved with them dire=
ctly so that I can fully understand their capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp; I reco=
rded some sections of their demo to me and can share some screenshots like =
these if it helps.&nbsp;

               They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking=
 for, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15=
 impressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the co=
urse of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is t=
heir confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove=
 it?

            Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So if =
it's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more sc=
ale at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage.&=
nbsp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Can =
you get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the list =
of 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                  Arkady,
                                  <br>
                                  <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoke=
d to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answe=
rs. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                  <br>
                                  <br>- We provide a name, address (likely =
an office), email address, and phone
                                  <br>- We can get the target to click on a=
 link
                                  <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, =
either for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                  <br>
                                  <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'=
d like to see evidence of:
                                  <br>
                                  <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions withi=
n a two week timespan
                                  <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie=
 after a certain period of time
                                  <br>- any additional tracking data on the=
 target
                                  <br>
                                  <br>This would likely be deployed in the =
US or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was=
 for $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a =
client to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that =
end please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential c=
ost savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>Thanks so much!
                                  <br>Josh
