Josh,

I=E2=80=99ve forwarded your questions and concerns to Influ2 to see if we c=
an make
this work.  Their initial response was that the match rate is about 50-60%,
so 50-60 out of 100 will see their ads. If you provide the list and
creatives, it will take 2-3 days to launch and up to a month to reach
everybody (depending on how active their media consumption is).

I don=E2=80=99t think we can get a 100% match rate on any platform or strat=
egy.

Arkady

       It sounds as thought this may not be possible; as it stands now we'r=

       For example, the most likely case study is three different groups of=
 10-20 people who would need to be exposed to similar content (so 30-60 *to=
tal*.) We will know in advance their names, email addresses, phone #'s, and=
 working addresses, and could easily send them content that would point the=

                    It's kind of doable through a DSP as standard retargeti=
ng. The only difference is that due to a small amount of impressions and li=
mited number of people the CPM should be extremely high in order to maximiz=
e the probability of showing the ad. I would set for example a $200 CPM. Th=
e spend on each campaign will be below $1.

          Honestly, I'm not sure it would be straight forward on the DSP si=
de.&nbsp; I would allocate a small budget say $1000 towards the DSP side to=
 try this methodolgy&nbsp;and see what the results are, since it's not prov=

                   But still it's a &nbsp;probability game. There is no gua=
rantee the person will see the ad as DSP's are not built to work with a sma=
ll number of impressions. For instance, we would use all filtering to minim=
ize the listening costs. So we listen to only 1 of 5 (or 1 out of 10) impre=
ssions.&nbsp; It decreases the probability.&nbsp;

          Listening is really a benefit of the relationship I have with my =
DSP, I'm not sure what the cost per "listening" is LOL, but I can leverage =
extra account management as needed as long as there's some decent spend hap=

                   The takeaway, we can try it with my DSP, but it's not gu=
aranteed and the CPM will be high.&nbsp; Alternatively we can add a brandin=
g DSP campaign with Lat long or zip code and behavioral targeting to the st=
rategy below.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would cover the territory for the business w=
e're targeting and the below strategy would target the individuals.&nbsp;

             IIR, using lat/long we can target people at a certain place at=
 a certain time, but if that happens to be an office building with several =
thousand people over the course of a month or more it's hardly specific eno=
ugh to be useful, and would probably cost a lot to create impact. Is that c=
orrect?

          That's correct.&nbsp; Finding a needle in a haystack (commercial =
building) will be very difficult, thats why we typically to Lat Long and Da=
y parting to reach a certain "audience" at a certain location but not neces=
sarily particular people.&nbsp; Again, it's not tested on specific people u=
sing DSP's and I'm not sure if it will 100% as effective and trackable as I=
nflu2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                   I've been in touch with the founder of an interesting pl=
atform from Ukraine called Influ2 that is working wih a few brands in the U=
S doing person based targeting.&nbsp; Their founder is trying to move to th=
e US to set up his business here.&nbsp; He claims the platform does a secre=
t marketing mix of campaigns across Facebook, Linkedin and Google Ads on th=
e open web.&nbsp; They will need the names and or emails of the individuals=
 you need to target and creatives and then they will start to score their e=
ngagement with the ads and the individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricing is as foll=
ows but based on a larger list of say 1000+ names.&nbsp; The probability of=
 reaching everyone is not exact and obviously the more people in your pool =
the more you can reach:&nbsp;

                  </div>
                 </div>This is the approximate net cost from them, we could=
 obviously gross out any price to the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                 I've attached a spreadsheet that illustrates the scale and=

                <div>
                 I'm very interested in partnering with them for future pro=
jects or potentially being a partner for marketing of their services in the=
 US.&nbsp; &nbsp;For this project, I'd like to be involved with them direct=
ly so that I can fully understand their capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp; I record=
ed some sections of their demo to me and can share some screenshots like th=
ese if it helps.&nbsp;

             They certainly sound like they're selling what we're looking f=
or, but it's not clear to me what they would actually charge to get 10-15 i=
mpressions in front of less than 100 prespecified individuals over the cour=
se of a month. That's our use case: a) what would that cost, b) what is the=
ir confidence on being able to deliver, and c) how quickly can they prove i=
t?

          Technically the cost is 2-3$ per person per month.&nbsp; So if it=
's 100 people it's about $300.&nbsp; He did mention that you need more scal=
e at atleast&nbsp;1-2000 people for it would affect a larger percentage.&nb=
sp; &nbsp;So out of 100 people, we may not affect all of them.&nbsp; Can yo=
u get a bigger list?&nbsp; If not, I can see if we can focus on the list of=
 100 and ask to make it work as a proof of concept.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                Arkady,
                                <br>
                                <br>Pleasure speaking with you! Was stoked =
to hear your questions and am excited to see if we can all get some answers=
. Here's the use case we want to try to prove:
                                <br>
                                <br>- We provide a name, address (likely an=
 office), email address, and phone
                                <br>- We can get the target to click on a l=
ink
                                <br>- We can provide a dummy URL to use, ei=
ther for cookie drop + auto-forward or private page via a log-in
                                <br>
                                <br>Once the cookie has been dropped, we'd =
like to see evidence of:
                                <br>
                                <br>- &gt;10 legitimate impressions within =
a two week timespan
                                <br>- ability to self destruct the cookie a=
fter a certain period of time
                                <br>- any additional tracking data on the t=
arget
                                <br>
                                <br>This would likely be deployed in the US=
 or UK. Again, if we're able to prove this works cheaply (initial RFP was f=
or $1-2k to demonstrate feasibility) and efficiently we're looking for a cl=
ient to partner with where we could scale quickly and privately. To that en=
d please do keep an eye out for larger business implications, potential cos=
t savings, benefits of scale, etc.
                                <br>
                                <br>Thanks so much!
