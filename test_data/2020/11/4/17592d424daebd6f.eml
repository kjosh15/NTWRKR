Marco,

So good to hear from you! I'd be curious to hear your thinking on
IndigoMetrics, and also recently pitched a TV series using GPT-3 chat to
engage ardent believers on both sides of key debate issues that you might
find entertaining. Want to set up a time to briefly chat and compare notes?
My calendar is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest a time that
works GMT (I'm currently in Iceland, and, if the US Election goes the wrong
way, will be looking to stay in Europe - another topic to touch on!)

Looking forward to it,
Josh


P.S., your website has a grammatical error: "including
NewYorkTimesbestseller." Hope you don't mind my pedantry!

automatically scans the Internet for terrorist purpose, can analyze content

similar focus. One related to child protection and fight against child

providing law enforcement with some AI capabilities.
