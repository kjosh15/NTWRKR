Excellent!! I LOVE the TSK name - that's just genius. Let me know what
comes of your conversations on both projects; I'm not sure just who, but if
you're looking for outside funding or contacts I'd love to see who I could
find.

All best,
Josh

needed wasn't yet available. Over the years since then, not only has the
tech come to par but exceeded it with other technologies that can be worked
in, and of course Big Data and all such things. That concept is to assist
paraplegics and quadriplegics not only maneuver their equipment and chairs
with greater ease but affordably manipulate their mouse on their computer

provide real-time data of their immediate health and covid or similar to
their doctors or researchers.

series of tests to figure out something with irregularities in my heart
function, I caught on that something was about to occur following a test.
Went to emergency and they took me directly into the hospital where I spent
a week. The doctors said that; had I ignored what was happening and went to
bed, I would have either awoken while having a stroke, woken with a stroke
or not woken at all. Very sobering. What was funny was, I was to have a
teleconferencing regarding the other concept with a venture firm that were
going to help me see other avenues in my presentation of it. But there I
laid in a hospital bed, not only picking the specialists brains for my own
health but to better understand to better address how to have others avert
such a catastrophe.

stress test on a treadmill in the morning that kicked in my near stroke in

go home". My heart was fine according to the hospital specialists, however,
the branches into my lungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.

When I get home I'll shoot it your way. I'm also going to intro you via
email to the friend in workplace culture. Another friend (regarding indigo
AI) is a very senior executive with a very large hospitality chain,, from a
workplace tool it would be very helpful in my meagre grasp, but thinking
about it from a realtime guest experience would be insanely helpful IMO.

original email (welcome to the future...) and he'll then ask for an intro.
You'll understand later why I'm a bit protective of this friend,,, he's
super nice too, very easy to talk with.

mediate health and covid or similar to their doctors or researchers.<br>&gt=
; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The second concept has real-world background; this past=
 July, after a series of tests to figure out something with irregularities =
in my heart function, I caught on that something was about to occur followi=
ng a test. Went to emergency and they took me directly into the hospital wh=
ere I spent a week. The doctors said that; had I ignored what was happening=
 and went to bed, I would have either awoken while having a stroke, woken w=
ith a stroke or not woken at all. Very sobering. What was funny was, I was =
to have a teleconferencing regarding the other concept with a venture firm =
that were going to help me see other avenues in my presentation of it. But =
there I laid in a hospital bed, not only picking the specialists brains for=
 my own health but to better understand to better address how to have other=
s avert such a catastrophe.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The reason for my nea=
r stroke; all the tests that were being performed regarded my heart, which =
tests kept coming back as very healthy. It was a stress test on a treadmill=
 in the morning that kicked in my near stroke in the afternoon. The doctor =
at that clinic said &quot;your heart is fine, you can go home&quot;. My hea=
rt was fine according to the hospital specialists, however, the branches in=
to my lungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; =
&gt; And had the cardiologists and pulmonary specialists not let me know wh=
y this happened, I wouldn&#39;t have set out to create this concept. It was=
 so shocking (not post-covid related anything) that I replied in half words=
 with head shakes; Excessive Driving.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; My job at t=
hat time was setting up a western office for a larger eastern Canadian comp=
any and involved at least 1500+ KM&#39;s a week to service and acquaint wit=
h customers.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Depending on body type and we hear o=
f this common thrombosis occurrence on frequent flyers, frequent driving cr=
eates a myriad of major health issues. Stepping on the gas, stopping at a r=
ed light and repeating the cycles within a day, plus distance, sitting, cre=
ates compression. Some people get numb leg, some get heart palpitations,,, =
which, like me, were brushed off to coffee intake over the workday and comm=
on work stress.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; That concept is fairly straightfo=
rward, but I see something other in it than ones health; it can provide tru=
e big-data on what automobiles are worse for long distances. This could ser=
ve companies creating fleets, or auto-manufacturers redesigning car/truck s=
eats, researchers better understand compression thrombosis,, it could, if w=
orked with your Indigo AI (this just popped into my head) to give other und=
erstandings of &quot;Well Being&quot;.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Josh, last=
 week while we were email tagging, I was being directed by my doctor and an=
other specialist to go to labs for more blood-work and other unpleasant tes=
ts. Because of covid, labs are backed up and it was like a scene from a bad=
 treasure hunt movie, trying to get same day tests, fasting for one only no=
t to get a test and then trying to figure out another moment to fast again,=
 yet eat. All&#39;s good now before the next series of follow up work. That=
 was last week, it was comical.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I have some morni=
ng things to take care of but my afternoon is free, as well as Tuesday and =
Wednesday all day.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.o=
