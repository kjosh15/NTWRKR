Meet is fine - zoom is just default as it's the most popular option atm.

Currently we're in Iceland on a little farm a half hour outside of the
second-biggest town (which has 20k people in it). It's... remote. Really
strange moving from NYC to here and feeling like it's fundamentally the
same b/c I'm a parent and have worked virtually for decades. Is causing all
kinds of reconsideration on where/how/what we want from our lifestyle going
forward. Then again, that could have something to do with the US election
atm.

Talk soon,
Josh
