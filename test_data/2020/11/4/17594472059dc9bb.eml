I never thought that we would still see strange times like this in our
adult lives... I guess I've watched too many movies where things always
turn out smooth after a dark period... hopefully this is the dark period.

I've been framing houses and basically working 8-12 hours a day six days a
week... frustratingly/strangely but also kind of interesting... most of the
workers and other trades that I have been around are all Ukranian, Polish
or Russian born, and in their minds, the US elections don't mean much and
the "virus" is just a flu and people aren't dying lol... I almost threw a
guy off a roof because he was coughing and very sick at work, I found him
wiping his nose with his hand and then using my personal tools when I was
on lunch not thinking anything of it.... I have asthma and so does Vicki so
we've been diligent and careful with safety... that was a tense day... but
he wouldn't go home until I told the General contractor that myself and the
other framers would leave, not come back and I would call the health board
and shut the house down.... which sucks because I know the guy that was
sick just needs to make money but he was shaking everyone's hand and
coughing all over people and just being careless.

How are you kids doing in all of this?
