Hey Josh,

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Initially I wasn=E2=80=99t sure if =
this was a general reach out to a group of people.  Then I realized that =
perhaps this was meant for another David.

We never officially met, I was suppose to house sit for you this past =
summer but then decided to stay in Vermont.  We were connected through =
Weena.

Let me know if I=E2=80=99m misunderstanding something and there is a =
conversation wanting to be had.

Hope this finds you well in beautiful Iceland.

best
david


Almost as color defines vision itself, race shapes the cultural eye - =
what we do and do not notice, the reach of empathy and the alignment of =
response.  - Taylor Branch
