According to Wikipedia, the second biggest is K=C3=B3pavogur with30k people=
. But
I suspect you mean Akureyri. I'm curious because we just had to cancel our
planned trip to Argentina and we've been musing about what we're going to
do when the madness reduces....

As you know, I've lived on a farm for 10 years now - and I wouldn't go back
to living in London. Currently getting a workshop built so I can indulge in
more hobbies. :-)

So far all I have is foundations. :-)

https://p3d.in/KoKm0/shadeless

On hobbies: we have a couple of young friends staying with us who are
mostly working on a house we bought nearby (they both lost their jobs due
to covid) - they both have degrees in "making" and so we've been doing
various fun things together - next up is milling the pattern for a plaque
Rossy (https://inplicodesign.com/) has been commissioned to make - and then
we're going to cast it in bronze. Also planned, a hybrid wood/pewter table.

And I'm learning bass and piano - kinda wish I'd done that a long time ago.
