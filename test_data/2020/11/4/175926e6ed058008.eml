Thank you very much! Your thinking seems sound, although we're in the
process of soliciting strategic investors (and potential buyers) so
academic discussions would have to come off the back of that. Either we'll
get funding, in which case the academic study could be done in conjunction
with building the company, or we'll sell it, in which case I may be able to
do the study as part of the integration. (Or neither, in which case an
academic study might be the only reasonable remaining option!) Either way,
the money is likely to lead the academics - not sure how/if that fits into
a university mindset, even with the "new reality" of education post-Covid.
Do you have any thoughts on the likely impact of that orientation?

Similarly, what are your thoughts about the role of physical proximity for
this sort of research? I.e., my work has been 100% remote for a decade or
so now, and that is expected to become more common going forward. Do you
think most universities in the EU would be likely to want to have their
researchers physically nearby to do this research?

Many, many thanks - I really appreciate your assistance in thinking this
through!!
- J
