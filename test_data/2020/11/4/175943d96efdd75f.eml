Carne,

Thanks again for the call earlier. As ever, I left it feeling heartened
that there are good people out there in the world working to make it better=
.

You'd asked for an example of the outreach emails I send - see below. If
you're keen I have an entire writeup on the virtualized networking strategy
here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0=
-BG_0/edit>.
It's an unfortunate view into my own private rabbit hole, so be warned (and
forgiving!)

In the meantime I'd love to talk to your Amsterdam contact - his agency may
be a fit for the kind of work I'm looking for - and if you're game I may
circle back to connect with your friend in Berlin.

Let me know how/if I can ever be of help, and all best wishes in the
meanwhile!

- J
