We're here now! Came for summer break and didn't leave. Depending on
the election we may not come back. Strange times...

Glad to hear you're keeping busy; what is your work filled with these days?
And kudos to you for focusing on physical and mental health - now is
definitely the time to double down there!!!

All best,
Josh
