Mark,

Just spoke with Molly; sounds like she's got a lot on her plate! But also
so much potential; exciting to hear her role and remit has been officially
created within GSM. She's going to talk to Laura and we'll see if there's
room for me to lend a hand - many thanks for the intro!!

Separately, I just finished helping advise on a pitch for a TV series using
GPT-3 to engage with protagonists of divisive issues and isolate winning
semantic arguments. You'd love this stuff - have you played with their API
at all?? Generalized AI (or the indistinguishable appearance thereof) is
getting close...

All best wishes and thanks again,
Josh

There are the beginnings of similar groups forming in Automotive and
Energy. If Corning wanted to participate or anchor a Manufacturing, the
Department of Commerce would certainly welcome that.
