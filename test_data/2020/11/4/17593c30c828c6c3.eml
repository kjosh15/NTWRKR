1. Corporate web site video: think we need to overhaul this in light of the
Google Analytics approach. For example, we could just life directly from
the new about page:

"What gets measured gets managed" has been the driving principle for
business for decades, and yet most organizations have almost no measurable
insight into their highest value asset - their culture.

Then COVID-19 happened, and the value of workplace culture suddenly became
paramount. No other element drives such sweeping, massive impact across
organizations - or represents such significant risk.

Much as Google Analytics prompted the digital marketing revolution by
unlocking insights that could drive business initiatives at new scale and
speed, IndigoMetrics is creating the new world of Workplace Culture
Analytics.

Longitudinal data company-wide lets you steer your company in real-time,
avoiding risk and launching, measuring, and optimizing campaigns to improve
alignment, realize D&I, and provide upskilling support where, when, and
however it works best.

And that's just the beginning. IndigoMetrics lets your employees evaluate
the peers they work with most closely, aggregating valuable feedback to
help everyone know where they're doing their best work, and where they need
to improve. Then it rolls that up into the metrics you need most to steer
your company culture towards improvement, no matter what the market
conditions.

- So How does it work?
- the platform uses an algorithmically driven peer to peer review process
to ask your employees to give each other feedback on the specific actions,
behaviours and values that are important to your organisation
- Every week each employee answers 6 questions about 5 of their peers, on
average the whole process takes less than 3 minutes
- the questions and reviewees iterate algorithmically over time to allow us
to build up a multi-dimensional quantified assessment of each individual=E2=
=80=99s
behaviours in a time efficient manner
- importantly the behaviours measured are specific to your organisation and
can be dynamically changed as your internal goals or your external
environment changes
 and our process is specifically designed to address the bias commonly
associated with peer review systems
- Employees receive continuous, consistent feedback around the quality of
their behaviours and soft skills
- Managers receive a team driven assessment of each of their member=E2=80=
=99s soft
skills, putting them in a position to help each team member develop within
a framework set by your organisation
- Leaders receive consistent, timely data quantifying the quality of
relevant soft skills across their entire organisation =E2=80=93 helping the=
m make
cultural decisions informed by data and metrics
IndigoMetrics can help you and your organisation in many ways =E2=80=93 for=
 more
information please keep an eye out for the other videos on our website that
deal with specific use cases:
  -      Data that tilts the world in favour of Diversity and Inclusion
  -      Culture Management and Training effectiveness
 -        Pulse 360, build trust in your organisation
Digital culture management, the future of work
IndigoMetrics - the language of your company, by your company.

2. D+I Focus video: this makes me really twitchy. Seems like there is a TON
of room for error here. Are you ok if I give a shot at rewriting this with
more of a "we empower your D&I efforts" than "we solve for this by focusing
on soft skills" angle?

3. Culture change and training effectiveness: Love this, but think it's
missing:
- Provides data/insight all the way from specific individual action
statements to corporate trend lines.
- Has feedback loops baked in to improve alignment automatically and at
scale
- Can effortlessly incorporate any existing surveying efforts
- Automatically multivariate tests your culture campaigns, L&D, and
internal comms to give you feedback on what works where with who (WHAT KIND
OF REPORTS DO WE PROVIDE TO THIS END?)

4. Pulse 360, bringing feedback and review data to the future of work: I
think that if we have to explain why 360 reviews suck we're not talking to
the right people.

5. Managing corporate culture in a world of autonomous work: Yes, BUT would
say distributed not autonomous work. Autonomous employees are scary.
Distributed workforces are the future. Agree with the generally talented
point but think that we also need to focus on conduct risk, talent churn /
retention, and hiring (attracting top talent) as big issues here.

6. New participant video: Love this except for the last paragraph, which
sounds apologetic, and also think that it could benefit from a team
approach - i.e., this is info about you from the people you work with, and
vice versa, to create a framework within which you can all address the soft
skill areas that make you the best team you can be. We all want to know how
we can improve, but random criticism isn't helpful, and anonymous ranting
is just that. Indigometrics provides an alternative; clear, incisive you
alone can use to chart your own career improvement as you go, informed by
the people who know you best!

OVERALL: This is great stuff!! That said, I wouldn't explain how it works
in each video, because we explain it on our homepage, we provide access to
our sandbox to try it, and we'll walk anyone through it in person when
they're qualified as leads.

best,
Josh

P.S. I love that there's a category for "spare Josh text." I have become a
literal word machine.
