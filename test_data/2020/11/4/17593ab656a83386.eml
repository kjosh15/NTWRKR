While on a run I kept thinking about the Google Analytics analogy and was
wondering if a potential new feature set is a group of icons associated
with specific, differentiating metrics such as:

- Speed: the rate of change, either up or down, for each value
- Velocity: the rate of change, either up or down, for each value
- Delta: the difference between a value and its next largest grouping
(i.e., individual by group, group by division, division by company)
- Participation rate
- Survey fill speed
- Time on survey
- Device used
- Average
- Cost per value (associated with costs for whatever campaign is designed
to move it)
- Campaign type
- Clickthrough rate per upskilling link
- Correlation between upskilling links and rate of improvement

Each of these would be sortable by individual/group/divison and by survey
interval/by month/overall (noting this latter would naturally go flat over
time). So just with the above list we've already got a significant set of
data - it's just a matter of presenting this in a different way.

*>> Have you played with Airtables?*

If you look at Google Analytics' list of metrics you can see they've built
a really mature ecosystem designed expressly to support organizations in
maximizing their conversions (whether that be sales or signups or views or
whatever.) If we take the same tack, we'd want to focus not on
*conversions* but *improvement*, where improvement means greater alignment
to values. Correct? If that' so, what are the main metrics we'd want to
provide?

I keep coming back to David Wilson's HR person - she has a clear framework
she wants to use with well-researched values. What metrics do we need to
give her to support whatever actions she wants to take to increase
alignment with those values?

Here's an overview of its metrics, by Google (and a great way of framing
our own!):

Here's a complete list of GA's metrics:

Here's those same, explained:

n-google-analytics/

Here's an interactive way to explore GA's metrics:

   - https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/dimensions-metrics-explorer/

It feels like we already have almost all of this data; designing a
dashboard that more closely resembles GA's early dashboards might help us
shift our value proposition, even if it's an early prototype just to show
to investors! Thoughts?

best,
Josh

P.S. Are we using GA on our survey pages?? Because WTF we should totally be
doing this to optimize our results towards greater stickiness and
completion rates!! Let me know how we can get this in place - I'd like to
start digging into that data as we move forward with our pitches!
