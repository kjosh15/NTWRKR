Glad to hear you're alive and well out there! My speaking career went the
way of your cake commissions - as you note, experience with uncertainty and
anxiety are key skills these days...

We came to Iceland for a summer holiday (my wife is from here) and haven't
left. We're not on a farm in the countryside living the fully rural life
(well, fully rural inasmuch as a fast internet connection and no actual
rural responsibilities can be.) Waiting to see what comes from the election
to see if we're ever coming back to the USA. Very very very weird times
indeed.

Thanks for the connection to your college friend; let me know how/if I can
ever return the favor!!

All best wishes,
Josh

We're pretty used to uncertainty & anxiety; bike rides and rock-climbing
help.
