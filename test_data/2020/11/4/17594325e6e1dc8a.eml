Hey dude!

Not much to report in my life lol.... thankfully I've been able to work
through 80% of the shut downs.... Indoor/live venue Comedy performances
have all stopped in Toronto so I've pretty much been focusing on making and
saving as much money as I can (while I can).... and have basically been
shut off from anyone outside of family.

I decided to take the down time that I have to do some personal physical
and mental health work (just basically working out a lot, journaling and I
guess you could say meditating in a way)

The only real project I've been working on is myself lol

Have you been in Iceland since the spring?
