Putting up the new site here <http://indigometrics.com/TEMP/V2/>. We need
bios for both of us, but have otherwise stuffed it full of content wherever
Harry left Lorem Ipsums (which was all over the place). Please take a look
and let me know what you see/suggest - I'm just trying to be quick about it=
!

All best,
Josh
