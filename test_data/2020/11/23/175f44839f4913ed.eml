Awesome opportunity.

I keep coming back to whether we could/should measure just D+I =E2=80=93 =
rather than D+I as a central  part of organisations=E2=80=99 values.

I worry that when the review request comes in it will say =E2=80=93 =
=E2=80=9CNow complete your Indigometrics D+I survey where you assess =
your peers=E2=80=99 actions for their level of D+I adherence=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=93 I don=E2=80=99t think it works?

Maybe its just semantics =E2=80=93 we could call it a =
=E2=80=9CRespect=E2=80=9D solution for example.

I am also struggling a bit with a single definition of D+I, as a basic =
example, should we ask:

=20

*	Chris treats everyone the same no matter their station in life
*	Chris treats others how he would like to be treated himself

=20

Or

=20

*	Chris treats everyone how they would like to be treated

=20

I think D+I will be defined differently at different organisations?

So here's a thing.

Just got off the phone with World 50's D&I group leads. The D&I group =
now has 378 members, mostly D&I heads of the equivalent. They've asked =
me to talk to the member advisory board head about taking a role there, =
and also requested that I work with them directly to address some of =
their big challenges.

Those challenges are almost entirely technical. Members are hugely =
interested in data; privacy, access, bias, etc. and they want actionable =
insights on what to do about it from within companies that range from =
mid-size to the biggest.=20

The team has two main goals they want to achieve, technically. The first =
is a collaboration platform to divide the group up into cohorts =
attacking specific D&I challenges, so that whatever is learned can be =
brought back to everyone. The second is some kind of measurement so that =
everyone who participates can compare notes on where they stand with =
regards to D&I and measure what's working and how.

World 50 is trying to decide whether it should build its own solution or =
work with a partner. You mentioned the other day that you had a =
framework you could drop in for measuring D&I values: what if we offered =
that framework to W50 members exclusively for a year in exchange for =
development costs?=20

They expect to have 500 members by Q2 2021. That would be a HUGE client =
list and access to organizations from the inside, driven by one of the =
most high-profile issues those companies face today.=20

Hell, we could get BSS to run the marketing, UX, and UI issues and =
charge W50 to bootstrap the cloud conversion we'd need to meet the =
scaling costs.=20

There's challenges here; they've got Vivienne Ming giving a talk on Dec =
3 about a framework she's building to detect and measure bias (so maybe =
we could collaborate?), and W50 has been notoriously cheap/hesitant to =
buy tech solutions. But if we can make it cheap and easy for companies =
to enter an org chart and get some basic, useful metrics on bias... I =
think we could blow this out of the water.

=20

Let me know what you think - the D&I group heads have asked me to get =
back to them any time with any ideas and I'd love to follow up.

=20

how.<br><br>World 50 is trying to decide whether it should build its own =
solution or work with a partner. You mentioned the other day that you =
had a framework you could drop in for measuring D&amp;I values: what if =
we offered that framework to W50 members exclusively for a year in =
exchange for development costs? <br><br>They expect to have 500 members =
by Q2 2021. That would be a HUGE client list and access to organizations =
from the inside, driven by one of the most high-profile issues those =
companies face today. <br><br>Hell, we could get BSS to run the =
marketing, UX, and UI issues and charge W50 to bootstrap the cloud =
conversion we'd need to meet the scaling costs. <br><br>There's =
challenges here; they've got Vivienne Ming giving a talk on Dec 3 about =
a framework she's building to detect and measure bias (so maybe we could =
collaborate?), and W50 has been notoriously cheap/hesitant to buy tech =
solutions. But if we can make it cheap and easy for companies to enter =
an org chart and get some basic, useful metrics on bias... I think we =
could blow this out of the water.<o:p></o:p></p><div><p =
