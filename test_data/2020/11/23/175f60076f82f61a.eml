I worked with them a bunch a decade ago; they're keen to see if they can
use our platform to help push their content offerings:

GetAbstract.com

Most interesting is the feedback that they need a way to validate the
impact of their content, and also need to offer a new product in order to
stay competitive. Ideal!
