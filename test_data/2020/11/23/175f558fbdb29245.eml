Hey Stephanie! I hope you're doing well, all things considered. The
interesting times continue...

I had a question about how to wrap up taxes for 2020. I'm pretty sure we've
made less than the $103k maximum for foreign residency (above which you
have to pay the US regardless of where you live.) Given that, we have two
choices:

1) We can file taxes in Iceland on what we DID make and via the double
taxation treaty write off the US taxes. If we do this, can you manage that
paperwork? (www.greenbacktaxservices.com has an estimate form which lists
the exact forms needed.)

2) We can claim no earnings to Iceland, file as normal in NYC, and then
switch to fully Icelandic in 2021. This would save us taxes (as the rates
are higher in Iceland) and may be cleaner overall, but I'm not sure what/if
there are risks.

Can you let us know about #1, and if you have any view on #2?

Much obliged and all best wishes,
Josh
