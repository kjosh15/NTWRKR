Agreed with this on all fronts, and also think it's not what customers want
to hear.

I.e., yes it's probably more effective to embed D&I values with other soft
skills and measure them over time. OTOH, everyone wants to make a
measurable impact on D&I *today*. Taking an agnostic view with our data
doesn't feel like it's going to cut it in that respect.

The "we can measure, but you have to test and improve, iteratively" answer
is a more legitimate one but feels harder to sell.

Not much to add to that beyond what we discussed this morning; let me know
if the action statements fall readily into categories and we'll see if W50
wants to connect us w/ Vivian (or just use what we have!)
