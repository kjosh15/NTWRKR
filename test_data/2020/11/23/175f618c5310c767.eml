Khatdija, Bria, it was an absolute pleasure speaking with you last week.
I've been buzzing all weekend as I think I may have an answer to at least
one of your big technical challenges.

As I recall, one of the issues you're trying to solve is how to benchmark
where companies are in their I&D journey so that all the various efforts in
the space can compare efficacy and build from mutual learnings. One of the
problems with this is that apples-to-apples comparisons can lead to
competition instead of growth, but that without metrics it's hard to
validate actual results.

I've spent much of the weekend confirming that the platform I've been
working on, IndigoMetrics, can produce metrics based on the *relative
improvement* in a set of I&D values, instead of absolute measurements.

This means that each company could internally measure themselves against a
common core of I&D value measurements to help drive their various efforts,
and then share a *measure of improvement *to talk about progress with their
peers. I.e., companies that produce great results can demonstrate how much
they've advanced (compared to themselves!) in a way that celebrates what
works and how, without shaming or exposing anyone.

What's more, the platform is designed to scale via cloud extremely
efficiently, such that you could with a little effort make it available for
very low cost (or potentially for free?) on a predesigned set of metrics to
all of your members. Because the platform is designed to be whitelabeled,
this could be a purely W50 service to support all your members in solving
the D&I challenge.

Obviously there's a lot of big questions, but I think there's something
here. Is it worth a followup conversation?

Entirely separately, I did a little poking around the collaboration
software space and there's a TON of options. Happy to talk through your
needs and goals here to see if I can be of further help in specing out how
to support smaller cohorts within the larger D&I group.

Looking forward,
Josh
