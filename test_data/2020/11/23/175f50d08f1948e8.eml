Looks like jejacks0n@gmail.com published his results to the group, which
is... cool, right? We open sourced it, and he ran with it. As designed.

That he wants to pass the fork to our GitHub repo is super kind; do you
want to take possession?

And let me know when you're up to connect - it's crazy times, man!!

All best,
Josh
