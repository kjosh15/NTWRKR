Thanks, Jeremy!! Let me know if anyone picks up on these changes; if
something surfaces as really popular we can look at rolling it onto the
website. In the meantime keep us posted on how this design works in your
experiments.

Now I'm off to get some Scigrip #3  and shelf liner to mess with...

All best,

</div><div>Modular concepts, where various subassemblies are intended to be=
 capable of being swapped out. This comes down to four primary subassembly =
divisions:</div><div><br></div><div>- The housing subassembly - the primary=
 box that everything fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid subassembly - the s=
liding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit switches, and coin magazine<=
/div><div>- The basket subassembly - the face plate and basket that slots o=
nto the housing subassembly</div><div>- The electronics subassembly - weath=
er resistant box for the the Arduino</div><div><br></div><div>These subasse=
mblies are separated into their component concepts so they can be replaced =
or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and basket subassemblies ar=
en=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subassembly. They inter=
lock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pins, and can be rem=
oved fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue them in place, you ab=
solutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replaced to allow smaller=
/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance, I=E2=80=99m go=
ing to be replacing colors and swapping between my two box placements perio=
dically to see if different colors (or transparency) perform differently. T=
his aspect of the design removes the need to have any access panels.</div><=
div><br></div><div>Other parts of the design have similar interlocking conc=
epts. This is notable in the assembly steps of the basket, as pieces are sl=
otted in from the back of the face plate. The basket ribs are then slid int=
o position and things are bolted together, which creates a cohesive and sta=
ble subassembly that can then be glued more easily with minimal effort in h=
olding / getting things aligned properly. I may post a couple photos/videos=
 of this on my final build, because the order of operations matters a bit h=
ere.</div><div><br></div><div>Better weathering potential. Drainage holes h=
ave been added to the corners of the bottom panel that allow moisture to dr=
ain (regardless of level / lean orientation). The electronics subassembly a=
llows better whatever level of weatherizing you feel is needed. I personall=
y have only built the box and then rubber banded one of the panels in place=
, so I can still easily access the electronics, but since the subassembly i=
s designed to keep a gap between the inner walls of the housing subassembly=
 it means less water will be touching the surfaces that the electronics are=
 mounted to.</div><div><br></div><div>The basket volume has increased by so=
me ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, but the basket dept=
h has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding lid has 1cm more tr=
avel, and is a little more than 2cm wider.=C2=A0 That, and other design twe=
aks to the basket increase the volume for food, and reduce the area that sc=
raps or other material can accidentally fall it into the coin delivery area=
s. This may have an impact on accidental coin activations, but that&#39;s s=
omething I plan on running an experiment on -- in this version I actually j=
ust wanted to increase volume and will run some tests on different aspects =
of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout and placement of parts is opti=
mized to get everything onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=E2=80=9D x 15.=
1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color parts, and the transparent parts can be doubled=
 up on a single sheet of the same dimensions. This allows ordering two colo=
r sheets and a single (doubled up design) transparent sheet. So two crowbox=
es, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I know some laser cutters won=E2=80=99t be=
 able to accommodate that size, but I optimized for what was immediately at=
 hand during the pandemic, and that was the capabilities of Ponoko.</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>Transparent part usage was reduced in the housing subasse=
mbly, which means the housing is fully opaque when using an opaque acrylic =
(no transparent parts come through from the back to the front except for th=
e lid). The logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/light or movement =
could unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one side of the housi=
ng to the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom panel has some holes f=
or drainage, and also a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D of slots that =
sensors or subhousings can utilize in future revisions or iterations. For i=
nstance, the coin sensor uses this interface, as does the electronics subas=
sembly, and each can be mirrored to use the right or left side depending on=
 build or deployment concerns. A similar concept is available on the bottom=
 of the rails (to hang things from), but that=E2=80=99s not being utilized =
in these designs.</div><div><br></div><div>The coin magazine has more capac=
ity, and is designed to allow more flexibility in movement (in that it=E2=
=80=99s not glued to the lid), which makes jamming less likely (potentially=
 even when using non U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now slots into posi=
tion, so placement doesn&#39;t require measuring and gluing. It&#39;s held =
in position between the lid and the perch platform using a piece of styrene=
 without needing to glue it in place.</div><div><br></div><div>There=E2=80=
=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs, but you=E2=80=
=99re welcome to hot glue the subassemblies together since it=E2=80=99s fai=
rly trivial to remove and might minimize rattling and other noise. I=E2=80=
=99ve also used <a href=3D"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AS9NAS" target=3D"=
_blank">shelf liner</a> to reduce noise from dropping coins.</div><div><br>=
</div><div>Anyway, since I don=E2=80=99t have a better place to document th=
ese things, you get this nerdy novella here. Hope these designs are useful,=
 and that you=E2=80=99re all staying well and healthy.</div><div><br></div>=

>Hi! I&#39;ve been working on building a crowbox and my brain has totally l=
atched onto this as something I&#39;d like to chip in some of my free time =
this winter on. Thanks so much for all of your efforts everybody, Josh espe=
cially. It&#39;s been really fun to start working on building one, and that=
&#39;s very much attributed to your massive efforts and all of the material=
 that&#39;s been put together so far.<div><br></div><div>I remember your te=
d talk from way back and have always loved the idea. After some googling I =
ended up on your project. I was just going to hack together some things fro=
m a now defunct automatic dog feeder I have sitting around, but this is so =
much better!<div><br></div><div>@Josh, what are your thoughts on creating a=
 repo or two on github or gitlab? One for the code, and one for the shape f=
iles and pdf print templates etc? I&#39;d consider forking the shape files =
and making some proposed modifications to them -- I&#39;ve got a lot of ide=
as floating around -- not really &quot;waterproofing it&quot;, but minimizi=
ng water damage potential and making it more weather resistant (I&#39;m in =
Colorado so get to do real world testing, haha).</div><div><br></div><div>H=
ere are some of the ideas I&#39;ve formed so far and will bring as proposal=
s if we had things up on github or gitlab. I know full well that a lot of t=
hese things may necessitate re-recording some of the really amazing videos =
at some time in the future, but I&#39;ve got a couple solutions about how s=
ome division in the housing will make it easier to version things, includin=
g generating new videos in the future.</div><div><ol><li>Add drainage on ba=
se panel (drainage holes in all four corners, and small grid of drainage ho=
pes near the coin sensor assembly / coin entrance)</li><li>Move power suppl=
y hole to the bottom</li><li>Make the front/basket subassembly replaceable =
using 3m nuts/bolts/washers=C2=A0(this would allow for minor versions -- v2=
.0 -&gt; v2.1 could be only adjustments to the the basket subassembly, or c=
hanges to improve the base subassembly independently, or testing different =
material / color options)</li><li>Switch to metric for everything (I see in=
ches in some places, and even as an American I don&#39;t want to anymore, h=
aha)</li><li>Migrate to using a single limit switch in the back of the mach=
ine by the perch hook (is there a redundancy reason for the two limit switc=
hes that I&#39;m missing maybe?)</li><li>Remove the perch hook and include =
it into the shape of the perch platform</li><li>Find and utilize a standard=
 adapter measurement for the base reinforcing ring / bolt holes in base pan=
el (for this I mean something like=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.globalindust=
rial.com/g/plumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-flanges" rel=3D"nofo=
llow" target=3D"_blank">https://www.globalindustrial.com/g/plumbing/fitting=
s/brass-fittings/brass-face-flanges</a> -- are there international options =
for this kind of thing as well, or some other standard?)</li><li>Add more h=
ex nut shapes that can be glued on the inside (in the Final Assembly - Step=
 2 video, a couple nuts are hot glued to the inside, but we should provide =
pieces like the included hex wrenches that can be glued in places with the =
washer/bolt -- this would also be part of idea 3)</li><li>Provide water res=
istant housing alternative to the sled (I&#39;d also like for this to bette=
r fit on the shelves / slide in out / potentially be oriented vertically on=
 the rear panel instead of horizontally and removing the front sled shelf)<=
/li><li>Remove the need for the soldering iron and related steps (I don&#39=
;t think we need to solder to the limit switch(es) or the alligator clips, =
crimping things should be enough for solid contact, even in weathering cond=
itions, right?)</li></ol>Here&#39;s a couple questions for you Josh. How co=
ncerned are we in terms of cost associated with the housing build? I don&#3=
9;t plan on making it super expensive or anything, but it may be worth havi=
ng some priorities for which things I can/we optimize towards?<br><div><br>=
</div><div>Like, build quality/durability, simplicity of build, simplicity =
in ordering, cost of build, flexibility in versioning / color options (I wa=
nt to do this purely so I can test different colors), flexibility in option=
s (for instance, the housing alternative to the sled), etc.</div></div><div=
><br></div><div>Thanks again! It&#39;s been really enjoyable to work on the=
 crowbox so far, and if I can, I&#39;d be happy to help out in other ways t=
oo. I&#39;m a software engineer, and am interested in discussing the code /=
 hardware as well -- including a raspberry pi implementation, but that&#39;=
s an entirely different topic and one I haven&#39;t dived into fully yet.</=
