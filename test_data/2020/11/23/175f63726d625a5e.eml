Thanks again for the call(s) recently; it's been hugely helpful to be able
to talk this stuff over with someone I trust and who can ask good
questions.

Wanted to follow up about the potential conversation with your friend at
Apex about potential M&A. You also mentioned you have some friends at some
consultancies who might have useful feedback. Any help is appreciated!

All best,
Josh
