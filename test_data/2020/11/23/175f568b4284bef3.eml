Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the next couple weeks; I'm=
 curious to hear what you're working on and to see if I can help!

All best,
Josh

Below are a few of my =

behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!

impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
