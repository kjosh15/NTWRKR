I started compiling my notes on contacts for VC, and have a couple dozen
individuals and a couple dozen companies, along with 271 1st degree
connections with folks who identify as being a "VC". Rather than send you a
grab bag I'm going to trawl through my LinkedIn contacts to see where I
have a strong personal connection and start there - unless you have a
better idea?
