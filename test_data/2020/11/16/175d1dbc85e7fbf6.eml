Hannes recommended I talk to you; I've co-developed a SaaS platform (
www.IndigoMetrics.com) for statistically modeling engagement and alignment
to core values within corporations and we thought you may have an interest
in analyzing the data and/or using the platform. Are you available to
briefly discuss? At present I'm based in Akureyri, but for the time being
we must use zoom!
