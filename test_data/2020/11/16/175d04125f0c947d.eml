Good to connect today; I really appreciate your honesty about the
experience of being there now - it's a strange, strange world for everyone
and knowing a little about how life is in NYC helps with the grief of my
own family out here in snowy Iceland!

As I said I wrote up what I got from our call so you can correct me if I
misunderstood anything - and to prompt us both to think about how we can
support the process! Let me know if I missed anything or can provide
anything further.

1. You're going to pack up the things on the "Ship now" list along with
anything from the "Ship when finished" list that you aren't using by the
end of November.

2. When you decide about if you want to stay in the apartment we can
formulate an email to the landlord together before the end of the month.

3. If you don't plan to stay, we can together make a list of stuff to sell.
If you do plan to stay, let us know what you'd like to keep that isn't on
our lists and we can figure out selling it to you directly.

As ever, huge blessings on you and your family. You're doing amazing things
as a father in an incredibly hard time!!!

All best wishes,
Josh
