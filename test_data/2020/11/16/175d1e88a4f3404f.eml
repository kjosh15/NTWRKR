Hey Josh - to be honest, I haven't updated my CV for a long time, but my
LinkedIn profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/earldossantos/> is the
closest to up to date. Over the past year, I've helped build a network of
hundreds of celebrities & influencers who have been doing waves of organic
posts and paid ads. We raised over $5 million for state parties and
downballot candidates, who otherwise wouldn't get funding. Before working
on political projects starting in 2018, I have served in growth & product
roles at successful startups.

Hope that gives the necessary background, but let me know if you need more
info.

Thanks,

Earl
