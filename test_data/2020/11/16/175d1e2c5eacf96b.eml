We're as safe from crashes as I know how to make us. Plenty of server space
and everything is up to date.

As a best practice you want backups off-site in case something happens to
the server, which might only happen once in ten years, but it only takes
once. I've got us set up with two layers: one on-site daily service-wide
snapshot managed through our main control panel, and then each site has its
own daily off-site backup, except for krav-maga.nyc which doesn't change
much so it's just weekly. We keep three rolling backups of each in case we
don't notice something right away.

Those backups are all pushing to my own Google Drive account right now, but
I'm happy to have that rerouted to someone else's. FitHit and Krav-Maga.nyc
were pushing to Dropbox but the connection is notoriously unreliable so I
suggest sticking with Google Drive which hasn't let me down yet.

I'll CC Josh here so he's in the loop, and make sure he has admin
credentials for all three sites and the Plesk control panel.
