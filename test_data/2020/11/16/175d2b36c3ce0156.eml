Sorry to hear the numbers are so bad there - but good news about Lydia!

The got cases down from 100/day to 3 yesterday in a couple weeks. Note that
hadn=E2=80=99t been requiring (or even recommending) masks until then, but =
still -
compliance has been enormous since. So feeling good about being here.

Quantum black look like they have terrific marketing, but it=E2=80=99s not =
at all
clear what they actually do. Apparently that didn=E2=80=99t prevent them fr=
om
getting acquired, which I find alternately encouraging and concerning - wtf
don=E2=80=99t I know about them that made their deal go through??

Any word back from new lab?
