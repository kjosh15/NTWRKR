All of the above, but on the back of a SaaS platform. I love SaaS b/c it's
eas(ier) to get funding, growth paths are readily determinable through
testing, it's easy to explain, and if there's growth key roles are easily
filled (i.e., "do sales for this SaaS platform").

I'd say it's twofold:

1. Since COVID networking is now fully virtualized.
2. Everyone is a freelancer now.

Given the above, we've combined all the best in class tools for managing an
individual network and optimising it for collaboration and outcomes.

More of an anti-scheme. Just like I quit using folders for email (and now
use search) I'd suggest storing them in as accessible a data store as
possible. I don't have a good one, so am running my current media campaign
to self-sort. For example, I'm speaking to the head of UNICEF today, on
accident, but if it turns out she's too important or unpleasant then I'll
have to find a way to re-ingratiate myself later. In the meantime, there's
potential immediate value, and I'll know if it's worth moving her up a rung
in my contact circles.

Absolutely, esp. because this allows for multivariate testing. Thoughts?
