Thanks, Julie. Answers inline below:

Q: Do you have a company that ships to Iceland?
A: Not yet. We're in communication with the one you suggested, but they
need a weight estimate to quote us.

Q: Where will we be bringing things?
A: As above.

Q: How much is left?
A: Not sure; the gentleman taking care of the place is supposed to have all
our stuff packed by the end of the month but he's... behind. I can get you
a better estimate as we get closer, but it's likely that it'll be boxes,
plus a table, plus some random stuff he hasn't figured out yet (including a
couple delicate items like a glass statuette.)

Q: What date do you need?
A: Dec 15th seemed like a good date to me - it's not XMas holiday yet so
there's still time for our stuff to transit before the holiday. Let me know
if you think that's folly!

Q: What furniture is coming?
A: The only thing we're considering is a wooden table, about 6" long and 4"
wide. Legs are removable. Will that be a big problem for shipping in your
experience? I.e., would that fit easily on a pallet, or would it expand the
size/costs of what we're shipping?

Let me know what else I can tell you so you can make an estimate. Is the
traffic still heavy for folks moving out of Jackson Heights?

Many, many thanks,
Josh
