Seattle winters are rough - my advice is to get some full spectrum bulbs!

In terms of your Zoom series, if I have any connections on LinkedIn I'm
more than happy to reach out for you. Neither Max nor Nik is a direct
connect, unfortunately, but let me know if there's anyone else I can help
with!

Many thanks for all the help,
Josh
