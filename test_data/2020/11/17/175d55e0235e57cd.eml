Do you have any sense for the price elasticity of contractors vs. hires?
Korn Ferry wanted to pitch me at $500k/yr for a FT role three levels below
the CHRO. Now I'm being asked to contract directly to her for 1-2
days/week.

In my experience contractors make more hourly, but given the pandemic,
working remote, etc. etc. I have no idea what rate I should pitch at. I'm
planning to offer 1 day/week (day rate vs. hourly) but could really use a
second opinion at where to come in at - i.e., I don't want to leave money
on the table, but I also want high confidence in securing the role. Any
thoughts?

Very much obliged,
Josh
