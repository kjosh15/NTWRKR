Since the pandemic began everyone has been building their networks in a =
newly virtualized world, but most of it has turned out to be spam. You and =
I have connected in the past; I wanted to invite you to reconnect to see if=
 we could help each other in the future.

Below are a few of my current =
projects; let me know if any strike your interest, or just hit me with an =
update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,
Josh


###

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.=
com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for autonomously managing =
behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
