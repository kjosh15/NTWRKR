&gt; This is bonkers!! It&#39;s such a fantastic deep dive into the topic, =
and I *love* how it stitches together all kinds of different scientific imp=
lications and history for each element. Super, super fun. I know it&#39;s n=
ot the right demographic, but the Storybots
 series for kids keeps coming to mind - just the energy, excitement, and li=
ght touch on many different aspects of scientific topics. Very cool.
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; =C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#39;d be very curious how you&#39;d rewrite this for Netflix; you me=
ntioned they were tough to integrate with at first, but thereafter were ver=
y supportive. I&#39;d be curious if they&#39;d be game to dig into this as =
an opener for a larger-scoped set of series around
 fundamental scientific topics. Elements is ideal as it&#39;s so... element=
al. But You could expand this to cover core concepts of any field; physics,=
 or law, or disease... it&#39;s essentially taking a categorical approach t=
hat underwrites human history and using
 it as a lens to explore how humans have shaped their world. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; =C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; A bit cart before the horse, I know, but the idea is so catchy, and ha=
s so much scope it&#39;s hard to ignore. I&#39;m imagining that the style i=
s going to set the tone in a big way here.
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; =C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Let me know if a followup call makes sense - I&#39;m excited to dig in=
to this! <br>
