Going well, thanks! Getting used to Seattle winter and still learning the
ins and outs of Amazon billing.

Otherwise organizing a Zoom series with founders in tech from the Former
USSR. If you happen to have a contact for Max Levchin (Affirm), Nik
Storonsky (Revolut) or other interesting founders with roots in the Former
USSR, please do let me know! :)

Best,
Val
