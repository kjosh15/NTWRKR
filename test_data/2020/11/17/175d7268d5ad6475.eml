Chris,

Just had a great conversation with a friend of mine who knows everyone in
the NY Tech scene. We talked over our raise strategy and she was *very*
concerned about the approach. Essentially she felt like we were
undervaluing with the UK raise ($1mm was "angel investing, if that") which
sent the wrong message to US VCs. Then, if they passed, they'd expect to
see us take that funding instead of delaying to go to strategic investors.

Her take was that we should go straight to Strategic Investors and ask for
funding. If that results in M&A, ok, and if not, we can go to UK angel
funding to get staff and some more size before returning to the US in a
year for VC or to try again for M&A directly.

Separately, she pointed out that in the US you MUST include D&I as a major
part of it (she also felt that Future of Work was a big part of the pitch
here) whereas in the EU that's not nearly as big.

Let's discuss - her arguments made a lot of sense to me.

- J
