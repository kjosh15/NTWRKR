There are a few places for rent - or rather, that aren't occupied. We're
now part of the community such that we could ask the owners and they'd rent
it out. We managed to find a 12-room farmhouse with its own water/power
supply, wood burning stove, and a barn full of firewood for <$1k/month
including utilities (of which fiber internet is one). After NYC it feels
almost criminal.

What *is* your work situation these days? Curious what you're up to! On my
end I've managed to co-found a SaaS platform to model human behavior and
create feedback loops to autonomously alter it within organizations. We
just signed our second large multinational and I'm suddenly left wondering
if I've accidentally created an algorithmic Goebbels or the answer to
endemic organizational divisiveness...

Let me know if you're up for a short call to catch up. I've discovered that
the space and time here has put a premium on stimulating conversations (vs.
NYC where I pined endlessly for peace and quiet...)!

All best,
Josh
