I think you=E2=80=99re right. I also think that from an investment standpoi=
nt the
fact that Lane 4 is going to prove/disprove our ability to change behavior
at scale is the =E2=80=9Cbig bet=E2=80=9D of indigometrics - I.e., if it wo=
rks and we have
proof we can suddenly vault into that TrustPilot position. From that
perspective Indigo is a big bet, and one that could pay off really big.

IMO that=E2=80=99s the sort of huge roll of the dice investors secretly lov=
e, and
which they pay big for - as opposed to modest growth early on in an HR
company=E2=80=99s development.

If that=E2=80=99s the case, we actually need to show how there is nothing n=
ow
extant that shifts human behavior, and that we have strong evidence we can.
Do we have that?
