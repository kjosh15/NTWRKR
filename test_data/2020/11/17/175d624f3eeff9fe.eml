Do you have any sense for the price elasticity of contractors vs. hires in
the US? Korn Ferry wanted to pitch me at $500k/yr for a FT role three
levels below the CHRO. Now I'm being asked to contract directly to her for
1-2 days/week.

In my experience contractors make more hourly, but given the pandemic,
working remotely (team is in Boston, I'm in Iceland), etc. etc. I have no
idea what rate to pitch at. I'm planning to offer 1 day/week (day rate vs.
hourly) but could really use a second opinion. Any thoughts?

Very much obliged!!
Josh
