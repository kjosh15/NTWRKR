To whom it may concern,

Craig Meade, Executive Producer at NHNZ and Senior Firefighter, suggested
we contact you. Our platform uses regular brief (3 minute) surveys to
create a statistical model of organizational culture, and then employs an
expert system to autonomously align all the participants around those
values.

We see you already have a code of behavior on your webpage, and given your
results you've obviously got discipline through the organization. But given
that you've recently integrated all the forest and metropolitan fire
fighting it seems likely that the two groups have somewhat different
cultures that need to be made one.

If you're interested, we'd love to speak to you briefly about the platform
and if there's room to collaborate. We've worked with public institutions
before (we're currently working with the London police force, for example)
and are very keen to work with organizations like yours that may be looking
to achieve more cultural cohesion and alignment around values.

More information is available at www.indigometrics.com; let me know if
you're available for a brief call!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
