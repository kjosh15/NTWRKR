*Hello 2/3 remote students & families!*

This week will be dedicated to family conferences. We will have regular
literacy classes tomorrow morning and then asynchronous work will replace
remote literacy classes until this Friday. I will *NOT* hold afternoon
meeting tomorrow. *WEDNESDAY* we have off for veterans day. I am including
asynchronous work for the week in this email for students who want to begin
right away and they will also be posted to seesaw. They are meant to
replace remote literacy class time this week.

Finally I am including links to some of the songs we have been singing
during "*shared reading*" time. Sing them together and enjoy!

*asynchronous remote literacy assignments:*



*Reading: *Please continue to fill out a new reading log every week. You
should be reading for at least 20 minutes each night.*

screen!)agents of change: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCa-XVkz1Uc

1. Click on the link below to listen and read along with "*Grace for
President"*.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc0sBBc6YZU
2. Take both "Grace for President" quizzes. Take them several times to
improve your score each time!

quiz two -
https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/56c9f6ee9bd08fa2037878f1/g2u5w1-grace-for-president

*Choose at least one of the following activities:**(You may complete one or
all three)*
3. Compare the election in the book "*Grace for President*" to our own
presidential election we just witnessed. Were there any similarities
between the fictionalized story and our nation's presidential race?
4. Draw a picture, write or record on video how you are feeling about the
outcome of our election. There is no right or wrong answer.
5. If you were being sworn in as president of our country this week, what
are the first three things you would tackle? What is important to you? What
do you care about. What needs to be changed?

*Writing: *
By now everyone should have a beginning, middle and end mapped out for
their fairytale. Some of you are working on drafting and editing and some
are still filling out the graphic organizer. Make sure that you take these
few days away from remote classes to work on your story.  Ask an adult or
older sibling for help. If you feel lost please contact Ilan directly at
iweissman@ellabakerschool.org or have a grownup contact me. If you do not
have words down, it's time! If you finished quickly remember my motto,
"when you think you're done you've just begun!" There is always a next
step.
*Some possible next steps:*
a. check  that you have used all of the writing tools on seesaw
(including the editing checklist)
b. add illustrations
c. create a cover page with your name, illustrations and the title
d. write an "all about the author" page at the end(include a picture of you)
e. write a second chapter

The entire 2/3 team is excited to spend time getting to know families in
conferences. Please sign up with your assigned teacher if you have not yet
done so. If you have any questions contact me at
iweissman@ellabakerschool.org or contact my cell directly 347-415-9765.
