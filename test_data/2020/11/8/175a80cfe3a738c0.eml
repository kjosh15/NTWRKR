Hey Josh,

How are you doing? Cool to see IndigoMetrics' pivot.

I'm working at dxw, now (tech for good digital agency). We don't have
anything immediately needing contractors, but if that's what your
interested in, let me know, and I can get you an intro to someone here to
add you to our list for if something does come up?

www.dxw.com

F

PS I have changed my name since we last connected (I think). I'm F now and
my email address has changed.
