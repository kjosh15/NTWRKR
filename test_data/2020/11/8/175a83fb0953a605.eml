### Woodcutter vs west wind ###


ACT ONE

1. One day a woodcutter kissed his wife goodbye and went into the forest to
gather wood.

2. He walked through the fields and was chased out the other side by a hug
ram.

3. He walked over the hill and heard the howl of a wolf. He went running
down the other side!



ACT TWO

1. Finally, the woodcutter got to the bridge to the forest and began across=
.

2. As he crossed the bridge, the west wind teased the back of his neck.
He spun around, and the west wind teased under his ear.
He spun around, and the west wind teased his eyebrows.

3. The woodcutter was so mad he took in a huge gasping breath to yell at
the wind.
As he did, he accidentally sucked in the west wind!!
the west wind hurled and burled in his tummy, and spun and slammed around
inside him.

4. The woodcutter clasped both hands over his mouth and turned to run back
home.


ACT THREE

1. On his way over the hill the wolf stepped out onto the path
the woodcutter hollered in surprise, and
the wolf spun off into the air, out over the forest!

2. On his way through the field the ram turned and ran at him.
the woodcutter screamed in fear, and
the ram spun off into the air, out over the forest!

3. Finally the woodcutter gets home, and calls out to his wife
the wind roared out of his tummy and spun up her skirts!
The woodcutter's wife's face turned bright red and she bonked him on the
head with a rolling pin.



ACT FOUR - VERSION ONE:

1. The woodcutter ran back through the field, over the hill, and to the
bridge.

2. He hacked and spit, coughed and hurled, and the west wind came flying
out and down the river.

3. And that is why, to this day, the west wind is always meek and mild.
