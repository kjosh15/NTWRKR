Below are a few of my =
current projects; let me know if any strike your interest, or just hit me =
with an update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for =
autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if =
you've got staff that are now remote!

; a project to understand how to use=
 physically embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart=
 disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

: as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
