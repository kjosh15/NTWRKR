Josh,

Thank you for contacting Media Temple!

The $19.00 charge you are referring to is probably for a security service on a single domain on account 212181.  Since this ticket is not from within that account, I can't give you more specifics.  However, I do see that you have access to multiple accounts.  You can change between accounts by clicking on the person icon in the top right of your screen. The resulting page will allow you to navigate to other accounts and check the billing information.

Refer to these instructions for navigating your multi account:
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/all/204645510/managing-multiple-media-temple-accounts

Please let me know if there's anything else I can answer for you regarding the information in this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services. Feel free to reply to this support request or call us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you.

Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.
