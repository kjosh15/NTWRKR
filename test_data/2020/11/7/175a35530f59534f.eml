Is it Time for a
Grown-up Gap Year?

[image: ake rest. A field that has rested gives a beautiful crop. ~ Ovid]

In 2020, many college-age kids decided to take a gap year, given that Zoom
classes and social isolation are not exactly the experience sold in the
brochure.

It's traditionally been a perk of the privileged. Or an excuse for those
who didn't quite have their act together immediately after high school.

I definitely could have benefited from taking a year off between high
school and university. But given that I was the first person in my family
to go to college, I didn't even consider it -- I was just grateful my
parents could send me at all.

I did, however, take a gap year at age 51. My family and I took a trip
around the world that changed us all for the better.

Talk about privilege, right?

And yet, midlife gap years are becoming more common. And like me, you might
just come out of one more prosperous than before you left, in more ways
than you can imagine.

Stealth Health

My fitness in 2020 started out super strong, maintained during the early
months of the pandemic, and then fell apart over the summer. I'm back at
it, and if you're looking for inspiration to do the same, perhaps these
four stories will help.

Knee to Know Basis

About a year ago, a Further reader sent me some research that debunked my
belief that running is bad for your knees. This recent NYT article tells
you the same.

Not OK Boomer

This article is disturbingly informative, and may help us better understand
the generation that precedes us. But this is important to understand as
well: The cognitive decline and lower impulse control that makes one
vulnerable to misinformation "generally begin to appear around age 45, but
recent research indicates that they could be appearing even sooner." Work
that brain, people.

This is Your Mission ...

... and you *must* choose to accept it. You must continue to learn to be
cognitively and economically viable. It gets harder as you get older, and
that's why you must make it a priority to not let your age hold you back.

song was written by Leonard Cohen, who died four days after the 2016 US

meaning, but I think you know what it means today. (YouTube) further:
