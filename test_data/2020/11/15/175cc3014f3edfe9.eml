Yes, I certainly can imagine CPT-3 being an incredibly helpful solution =
for Estee Lauder. Though I do feel the uncanny valley seen in that =
avatar would prove to be too much for your average customer.

More broadly, it feels there could be a business opportunity to form a =
company around trying to show companies how they can adopt AI into their =
workflows to save money and grow their businesses.=20

On that and in advance of our chat, it=E2=80=99s worth me dropping a =
little question in your ear.

In addition to C-Side, I=E2=80=99d like to chat about ways CPT-3 might =
be able to use news wires in countries and languages around the world =
and repurpose and reformat that information into an English-facing =
global news website. I=E2=80=99ve begun to wonder what might happen if =
you take humans out of news writing.
