I'm sending this from the past to remind you that if you're finding being a
part of the advisory board too time consuming you're absolutely free to bow
out. Just drop me an email and I'll stop pinging you with updates - no hard
feelings whatsoever. Either way, thanks so much for being a part of this!!

Sincerely,
Josh
