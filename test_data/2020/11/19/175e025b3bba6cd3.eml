Understood. Because of timing and speed, we better push ahead without it =
then. And certainly, we wouldn=E2=80=99t want to cough up the money to =
craft it unless we secured funding.=20

Either way, I think the website alone would be a hit. Opinionated =
political enthusiasts certainly love to argue, so even without the show, =
it might not be a bad idea.

Some great examples there. Thanks for the list, Josh. More soon.
