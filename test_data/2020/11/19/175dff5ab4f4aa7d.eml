My dad is a winemaker (cellarmaster for Chateau San Michelle, founded
Snoqualmie Winery, etc.) so I'd love to join, but being in Iceland I think
you'd have a hell of a time getting it here!

Great to see you how you're diversifying members' experiences - I'm so
impressed with the pivots you've made this year!

December 8 at 7:00 p.m. ET. If you have enjoyed World 50's wine selections
at past World 50 gatherings, Kristie was there making sure we provided a
unique and interesting wine experience. She will be joined by Innovating
50's own Will Papa, SVP, Chief R&D Officer at The Hershey Company, who has
a wine tasting certificate from the Culinary Institute of America in Napa
and serves as a wine judge. We will ship you two bottles of wine: one old
world, one new world, and over the course of an hour Kristie and Will will
walk us through the history of each bottle and put our pallets to the test.
Spouses and family members are welcome to join.
