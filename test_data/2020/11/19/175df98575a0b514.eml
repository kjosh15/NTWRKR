Subject: BSS call

=20

Had a good conversation with Michael just now. Started out the convo =
asking about business and he confessed he was trying to figure out how =
to break out of doing standard ad agency work and really wanting to get =
into the kind of strategic consulting work we'd talked about originally =
around this time last year.=20

When we shifted to Indigo, he was explicitly aware that he was ranked =
very low "because I'm the boss, and that's fine." We talked around how =
BSS was very different than our other clients, but in fact more =
emblematic of the kind of cultures we were looking to support companies =
in building. He was clear that the platform as it stands now "isn't =
right for us" and made some suggestions around making it less stat =
heavy; he had a good quote that "you'll know you're succeeding when you =
can turn off the stats."

We then turned the conversation to where we could go next, and I =
reminded him that we had started the partnership hoping that BSS could =
sell a version of Indigo with their values leading; he really liked =
this, but pointed out that they'd want to make something that was =
proscriptive and possibly less data heavy. As we talked he got more =
excited and started thinking about a psychologist friend who had an =
entire empathy framework that might work really well and could be "BSS =
branded" as a means to get them into the kind of corporate culture =
transformation they really wanted to be doing - something that assesses =
"the ideal things you need to be for success."

I was very bullish on this and was clear that we wanted to partner with =
BSS in leveraging the platform to sell their secret sauce, and that this =
might be a great way to create an ideal diagnostic tool for them to help =
break into that market. He was really excited.=20

And that's where we left it. Overall it feels like a very positive =
direction for BSS to head in that it gives them ownership of their =
version of the platform to sell and brings in a new content framework to =
test. I'll loop back around later this week to see about next steps - =
let me know if you have any feedback in the meantime.
