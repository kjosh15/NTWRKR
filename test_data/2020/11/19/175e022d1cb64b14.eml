I went through the spreadsheet quickly; please take a look and see what we
can do without, and if we want to pull anything else from the list. I made
a note "really?" on things I thought we might want to reconsider.

Once that list is together we can push harder on getting them packed up -
Gustavo is packing now!

xoxo,
Josh
