Saw you on the Brady Bunch Bar at the I50 Summit yesterday and wanted to 
follow up and say hi. No agenda, but if you'd like to compare notes on 
new/emerging tech and what's latest at NatWest I'd be happy to connect for 
a brief call - the serendipitous connections at W50 have always been my 
favorite, and what I miss most in this pandemic. Let me know!

All best,
Josh
