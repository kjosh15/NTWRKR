Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics; an AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs=
 in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing; a project to understand how to use physi=
cally embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart diseas=
e, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20

Professional Services: as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and t=
eams on technology transformation and new innovation / product development.=
