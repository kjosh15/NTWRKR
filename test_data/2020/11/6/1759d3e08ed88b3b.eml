Trevor,

Thanks so much for speaking to us at the World 50 Innovation group
yesterday! You mentioned you're working with Microsoft and that it was like
being Charlie at the Chocolate Factory. The timing was striking as I've
been building a TV series around Microsoft's new artificial intelligence
tech, called GPT-3.

It=E2=80=99s a show that uses GPT-3's artificial intelligence to persuade A=
mericans
to see the other side of divisive issues.

Yesterday you said "comedians place you in a world where things aren't
completely real so you can deal with what is real" and that "the show is a
conversation going on with the audience." That's what the attached is all
about. Let me know if it fits your interest!

All best,
Josh Klein
