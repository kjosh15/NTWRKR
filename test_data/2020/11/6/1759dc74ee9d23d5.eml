*TL;DR: We're seeking funding / acquisition for IndigoMetrics.com. If you
know anyone in the data or HR space (either investment or operators) please
introduce me! Otherwise, should I drop the CGM project? More info below.*

###


1. Contract work

My personal runway is getting pretty thin. We're secure until the end of
spring, but I'm not counting on signing anything over the winter. At
present I'm targeting consultancies and big corporations for contract work.=
*
Do you know anyone who I could help with** digital transformation and
innovation strategy?*

2. CGM Project

I'm very, very keen on this project but believe that best case scenario
would be months of negotiation and discussions before it commenced - and
that I'm hoping to be in the process of selling IndigoMetrics by then. This
leaves me with two biq unknowns *I could use your help in considering:*

a. Is it possible/likely that there will be a long period of very light
effort in getting people situated around the CGM project which might
dovetail nicely with Indigo being sold/funded, or am I smoking crack and
biting off more than I can chew?

b. Will there be as much of an appetite for this project in 9-12 months
("post-Covid") when I may have time to get back to pushing it forward?

c. Are there any options I'm missing?


3) IndigoMetrics

My co-founder and I have decided to seek funding / acquisition for
IndigoMetrics. We recently signed Elsevier (part of RELX) as a customer,
meaning we'll be at two multinationals with ~60k total users by mid-next
year and operating at $.5mm in revenue. That in itself isn't mind-blowing,
but the increase in traffic (four more multinationals in the pipeline), new
branding (see www.indigometrics.com), and increasing interest in the space
(google "hr market growth") puts us in a pretty good spot.

The most salient difference is realizing we have a shot at quickly creating
the reason we built it in the first place - to radically improve the world
of work through data. Being bought by a big incumbent would mean we could
skip ~5 years of business development, staffing, infrastructure, etc. and
focus purely on building out features to have an impact in this space,
potentially leapfrogging the entire world ahead in key areas like D&I and
purpose.

The space is estimated to be worth $6.29bn by 2027 (see here
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hr-analytics-market-size-worth-6-2=
9-billion-by-2027--cagr-14-2-grand-view-research-inc-301060595.html)
and I think we have a good shot at a nice piece of that. Our current plan
is to get soft assurances of funding from VCs in the UK ($1mm on $10mm
valuation), then take that to the US to seek $3mm on $15mm valuation, and
then take that to solicit involvement by strategic investors / potential
acquirers for a buyout at $20-25mm. *Am I overlooking anything, and/or how
would you improve this strategy?*


###


Wishing you and yours all the best in these crazy times - as ever, if I can
be of any help please do let me know!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

*P.S. I didn't hear from you in response to my "Bow out option" for your
role in my advisory board, so am merrily carrying on. Let me know if you
need to revert on that, and otherwise I'll check back Feb 1!*
