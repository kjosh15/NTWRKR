Innovating 50 gathered yesterday for candid dialogue with trusted peers.=
 We hope these highlights continue to spark the insights and perspectives y=
ou need to lead and transform your business in these uncertain times. Pleas=
e feel free to share with your teams, and continue to lean into the power o=
f your community.=20

Jochen Zeitz

Chairman and Chief Executive Offi=
cer, Harley-Davidson

Jochen Zeitz shared with Innovating 50 members th=
e lessons he=E2=80=99s learned by changing organizations today into leaders=
 for tomorrow.

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/-IN50-2H-2020-Jochen-Zi=
etz-mp3/fxrhdx/726796847?h=3DApKy5JNrNS6dqK3e1n0ULGMJM0Pf2HO1Y_10GXefBRU
=

=09Changing course :: As the new CEO of Harley-Davidson, Zeitz was charg=
ed with transforming the legendary brand for the future. While Harley-David=
son=E2=80=99s iconic Easy Rider-influenced brand built a loyal customer bas=
e, many customers are aging and hesitant to see the company evolve. Meanwhi=
le, there=E2=80=99s a large group of potential customers who aren=E2=80=
=99t attracted to the traditional Harley brand, as they have different aspi=
rations from the core customers. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s the dichotomy we n=
eed to address with a specific strategy that still delivers what the core w=
ants but also reaches out with new and exciting products, language and mess=
aging that=E2=80=99s quite different.=E2=80=9D One part of this strategy is=
 the electric motorcycle, which reaches out to new customers by providing =
=E2=80=9Cthe Harley look and feel=E2=80=9D but in a modern, sustainable way=
.

=09Starting from scratch :: Although the road to building the electr=
ic motorcycle could rely on Harley-Davidson=E2=80=99s brand name and legacy=
, said Zeitz, =E2=80=9CEverything else is starting from scratch. So I look =
at this venture as a startup, and we need to structure it that way.=
=E2=80=9D This creates challenges, as different metrics are needed for the =
nascent electric part of the business and the traditional part of the busin=
ess, which is driving revenue. =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t want to cannibali=
ze your traditional business by taking your eye off the ball, but you know =
to compete in electric, you need a completely different mindset, mentality =
and focus.=E2=80=9D The motorcycle industry is behind the auto industry in =
embracing electricity, but the market will move in that direction. =
=E2=80=9CThis is a long-term play. We have to think in decades rather than =
years.=E2=80=9D=20

=09Welcome the criticism :: While some traditionalist=
s in the motorcycle space might denounce the idea of an electric motorcycle=
, Zeitz observed that this criticism comes with the territory of innovation=
. Any truly innovative product=E2=80=94from the first cell phones to the Te=
sla=E2=80=94inevitably faces a host of criticism at first. =E2=80=9CIf you =
want to lead and innovate, from my perspective, the more resistance you get=
, the bigger you are in terms of innovation,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYou=
 just have to keep at it, and do the right things.=E2=80=9D=20

=09Drivin=
g change through business :: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve learned in my career tha=
t business, while it does a lot of good, does a lot of harm, too, from a so=
cial and environmental point of view,=E2=80=9D said Zeitz. But, business ha=
s a huge opportunity to solve the major problems plaguing the world. Zeitz =
co-founded The B Team with Sir Richard Branson to activate the transformati=
ve power of business in solving global problems and to reframe sustainabili=
ty as an opportunity rather than a responsibility. The B Team=E2=80=99s rec=
ent work focuses on promoting an inclusive stakeholder approach, which Zeit=
z is implementing at Harley-Davidson, as he did at Puma. While he acknowled=
ged that large-scale transformation is a long-term process, he said: =
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a realistic optimist. =E2=80=A6 We=E2=80=99re starting=
 to realize what the problems are and starting to find solutions. I remain =
optimistic that we can solve the issues we=E2=80=99re facing.=E2=80=9D=20

Trevor Noah

Comedian and Host, The Daily Show

Trevor No=
ah brought his nuanced perspective to the Summit, as he shared with members=
 how his team has sustained the creative process in voicing complex issues =
to a global audience.=20

efBRU

=09Finding the levity :: As the creators of a comedic news progr=
am, The Daily Show=E2=80=99s team is tasked with the daunting challenge of =
finding moments of levity within often-depressing news stories. =E2=80=
=9CWe call it our =E2=80=98giggle at the funeral.=E2=80=99 We=E2=80=99re no=
t laughing at the dead body, but there=E2=80=99s got to be a moment at the =
funeral where someone makes a joke and then we go, =E2=80=98Oh yeah, we=
=E2=80=99re still celebrating life.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D The team stays focuse=
d on keeping the show=E2=80=99s perspective intact despite all that=
=E2=80=99s happening in the world. =E2=80=9CThat perspective is,=E2=80=
=9D said Noah, =E2=80=9Cthat contrary to popular belief, the world is not e=
nding. And so, until the world ends, we can enjoy being human beings and st=
ill pay attention to everything going on around us.=E2=80=9D

=09Make a=
 new show :: When COVID-19 hit, The Daily Show=E2=80=99s creative team had =
to determine how to produce the program remotely and what it would look lik=
e without a studio audience. Rather than focusing on the absence of his nor=
mal audience, Noah chose to get into the mindset that he was making a new s=
how from his new reality. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve tried t=
o do: work within my reality.=E2=80=9D He even renamed the show The Daily S=
ocial Distancing Show as a reminder: =E2=80=9Cso that I, myself, would alwa=
ys remember that this is a specific thing that I=E2=80=99m doing because li=
fe is not normal.=E2=80=9D A member later echoed Noah=E2=80=99s comments ab=
out leading through this crisis, saying, =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re all making =
new shows, so to speak.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=
=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B

=09Fueled by fire starters :: Asked what inspires h=
is creativity, Noah emphasized the importance of being surrounded by funny,=
 creative people. When he=E2=80=99s feeling uninspired, someone around him =
will inevitably say something that sets off =E2=80=9Can avalanche=E2=80=
=9D of jokes and humor, which reignites the creative spark. =E2=80=9CAll I =
keep trying to do is make sure the group has enough people in it who are fi=
re starters, enough people who aren=E2=80=99t afraid to spark a joke, spark=
 an idea, get something going.=E2=80=9D The team=E2=80=99s witty, intellige=
nt conversations inform the show=E2=80=99s conversational format. =E2=80=
=9CThe show is a conversation that is going on with the audience, so we try=
 to maintain that energy throughout.=E2=80=9D

=09Everybody is your cus=
tomer :: When Noah arrived at The Daily Show, he focused on changing the sh=
ow=E2=80=99s distribution because he realized that people=E2=80=99s viewing=
 habits were gradually shifting. He put the show=E2=80=99s content on all p=
latforms=E2=80=94from Snapchat and TikTok to YouTube and Instagram=E2=80=
=94to meet audiences where they are and to draw in new viewers. He also mad=
e sure the show engaged viewers through the linear TV platform but also sou=
ght to engage people who don=E2=80=99t watch TV at all. =E2=80=9CThat=
=E2=80=99s almost part of your customer base, even if they=E2=80=99re not y=
our customer,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CEverybody can be a customer; they =
just aren=E2=80=99t right now.=E2=80=9D=20

=09The formula for comedy :: =
Comedy has a formula: tragedy plus time, said Noah. =E2=80=9CAs long as you=
 have enough time that separates you enough from the tragedy, no matter how=
 small or big it is, you=E2=80=99ll be able to laugh at it. The issue is ri=
ght now we live in a world where the tragedy is ongoing.=E2=80=9D People do=
n=E2=80=99t know what to laugh at anymore because they have no distance fro=
m the tragic reality. =E2=80=9CThey cannot laugh at the absurdity because t=
he absurd has become the real. That=E2=80=99s a very strange place to be in=
.=E2=80=9D He observed that in more relaxed times, comedy tends to become m=
uch edgier, but in edgier times, comedy has to be =E2=80=9Cmore of a soothi=
ng balm so people can get through their day.=E2=80=9D

=09Empowering th=
rough tech :: Recalling the life-changing day in his childhood when his mot=
her brought home a computer, Noah said, =E2=80=9CI was just learning the co=
mmand prompts, but the world was infinite.=E2=80=9D Having experienced how =
empowering access to technology can be, Noah launched the Trevor Noah Found=
ation in South Africa, which seeks to equip schools to reach their full pot=
ential by providing the resources, equipment and training they need. =
=E2=80=9CSometimes people create technology for what they need, not for wha=
t the people they=E2=80=99re giving it to need,=E2=80=9D he said. Thus, the=
 foundation works with its partner Microsoft to bring tech to each school t=
hrough a human-centered design method that focuses on the school=E2=80=
=99s specific needs. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m trying to get to a place where =
=E2=80=A6 every school is connected, every student is connected and hopeful=
ly everyone has an equal shot at a good education.=E2=80=9D

Jen=
nifer Hyman

Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Rent the Runway
=

Innovating 50 members joined Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman to disse=
ct what innovation means when it=E2=80=99s not a matter of growth but of su=
rvival.

https://go.world50.com/e/159871/ummits-IN50-Jennifer-Hyman-mp3=
/fxrhf2/726796847?h=3DApKy5JNrNS6dqK3e1n0ULGMJM0Pf2HO1Y_10GXefBRU

=09A=
 fashion emergency :: Before COVID-19, Rent the Runway was on a 10-year =
=E2=80=9Crocket-ship growth path,=E2=80=9D building the =E2=80=9Ccloset in =
the cloud=E2=80=9D for its many customers. As the virus disrupted China=
=E2=80=99s fashion supply chains in January, the company quickly sought to =
mitigate inventory shortages. By mid-March, inventory had arrived, but shel=
ter-in-place orders were enacted, decimating Rent the Runway=E2=80=99s dema=
nd. Faced with no revenue and many fixed costs, Hyman had to act swiftly to=
 save the company she founded, slashing costs and making difficult people d=
ecisions. =E2=80=9CIt was a traumatic eight-day experience,=E2=80=9D she sa=
id. =E2=80=9CI had to do everything possible to not only save the business =
but to save the passion and the work of the thousands of people who=
=E2=80=99ve partnered with me over the last decade to build this industry-l=
eading company.=E2=80=9D

=09Alter your view :: In the past, employees =
came to work at the fast-growing company expecting to manage lots of succes=
sful projects and to rise in their roles and responsibilities quickly. When=
 the business changed almost overnight, Hyman had to reframe how employees =
saw their jobs in order to prevent mass attrition and motivate them through=
 the crisis. =E2=80=9CI had to convince people that their jobs were to lear=
n how to connect emotionally with folks on their team, how to inspire peopl=
e around them, how to ruthlessly prioritize what they=E2=80=99re working on=
, how to figure out how to do more with less.=E2=80=9D She championed the i=
dea of resilient leadership and emphasized that every employee is responsib=
le for it.=20

=09Address the existential questions :: Faced with an exis=
tential crisis, Hyman and her team asked themselves two essential questions=
 that guided their strategy during COVID-19 and provided an outlook for a p=
ost-pandemic future:=20

=09=09Will your business still be relevant after=
 COVID-19? The whole world is suffering from the same crisis at the same ti=
me, and this is fundamentally changing our values, how we live and how we w=
ork. =E2=80=9CThese trends are not necessarily going away.=E2=80=9D After p=
ondering the question, Hyman determined that Rent the Runway still had a pl=
ace in a post-COVID-19 world. =E2=80=9CYes, I think creating a sharing econ=
omy in a closet in the cloud is still relevant.=E2=80=9D

=09=09Coming =
out of COVID-19, will your business be more relevant or less relevant than =
it was before? Consider the shifting values and trends during the pandemic,=
 such as sustainability and digital acceleration. On sustainability, she sa=
id, =E2=80=9CMy company is squarely the most sustainable way to get dressed=
.=E2=80=9D Apparel has been one of the slowest industries to embrace digita=
l commerce, but 99% of Rent the Runway=E2=80=99s sales already happen onlin=
e. Seeing these trends, Hyman realized her company was positioned to be eve=
n bigger coming out of the crisis.

=09The next trend :: The fashion in=
dustry=E2=80=99s biggest upcoming trend is the transition toward becoming t=
ruly sustainable. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s part of the thesis we have that t=
he circular economy is going to be an even bigger part of the fashion indus=
try going forward.=E2=80=9D A small but growing part of Rent the Runway=
=E2=80=99s business was selling second-hand clothes, and Hyman decided to e=
xpand the business model and position the company as the platform for the c=
ircular economy in fashion=E2=80=94as the place where =E2=80=9Ca customer c=
an come and decide, with every unit of inventory, whether you want to rent =
it, subscribe to it or purchase it.=E2=80=9D While many companies jettisone=
d ancillary businesses during the pandemic, Rent the Runway did the opposit=
e by =E2=80=9Cwidening the aperture of the value proposition.=E2=80=9D She =
said, =E2=80=9CEven though the short term is going to suck, let=E2=80=99s m=
ake sure that we prioritize to come out of this to more strongly capture a =
much larger opportunity.=E2=80=9D

=09Mapping the mood :: Rent the Runw=
ay=E2=80=99s analytics team refined customer data by geography throughout t=
he pandemic, revealing significant regional differences in customers=
=E2=80=99 outlook. In states like Texas, Georgia and Florida, Rent the Runw=
ay=E2=80=99s business is accelerating, and almost 75% of customers in those=
 markets have returned despite high COVID-19 case numbers. The opposite eff=
ect is happening in states like California and New York. =E2=80=9CEven thou=
gh the rates of COVID are much lower in New York right now than in Georgia,=
=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cthe psychology of the consumer is fundamentall=
y different in New York, and she=E2=80=99s not yet ready to resume her life=
 as normal.=E2=80=9D=20

r example, in 2018, the Bank of England=E2=80=99s chief economist wanted to=
 use Spotify=E2=80=99s data to help predict the next recession. He wanted t=
o understand what was happening in the economy at that very moment, and he =
wanted to look for signals of anxiety in Spotify=E2=80=99s listener data. =
=E2=80=9CAnxiety could have a much bigger impact on how the economy respond=
s to a crisis than last quarter=E2=80=99s manufacturing output data.=
=E2=80=9D

=09Data science needs common sense :: Page warned that data =
strategies must be supplemented by common sense, as data dashboards tend to=
 overlook common-sense observations. When Spotify launched its Discover Wee=
kly playlists, Page worked closely with the data team, but then he met with=
 the customer support team. From that, he learned that customers would call=
 to ask why Frozen songs were appearing on their Discover Weekly playlists,=
 and that the support team would realize these customers had children and w=
ould successfully sell them a family plan. =E2=80=9CThe customization of Di=
scover Weekly =E2=80=A6 was driving the commerce of the family plan,=
=E2=80=9D he said, but the =E2=80=9Ctunnel vision=E2=80=9D of the data scie=
ntists didn=E2=80=99t see this connection. Only by listening to the custome=
r and applying common sense could anyone uncover that opportunity. =
=E2=80=9CA chief data scientist is employed to study data, but you need to =
counterbalance that with the people who produce that data. That=E2=80=99s t=
he link I encourage you to close.=E2=80=9D=20

=09The war for attention :=
: Every platform is fighting a war for users=E2=80=99 attention. =E2=80=
=9CIf Netflix gets me to binge-watch three times 10 episodes of Narcos, whi=
ch I did,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthat=E2=80=99s 30 hours that music doe=
sn=E2=80=99t see, that Facebook or Instagram doesn=E2=80=99t see.=E2=80=
=9D Netflix has won the attention war for 30 hours. Page believes that comp=
anies must start by gaining attention and then move on from there. =
=E2=80=9CIf I win your attention, I can win lots of other things.=E2=80=
=9D While people are paying for and listening to music, music is =E2=80=
=9Cjust wallpaper,=E2=80=9D so Spotify needed a new way to capture users=
=E2=80=99 attention. Listening to a podcast requires paying more attention =
than listening to music does, so Spotify=E2=80=99s move into the podcast bu=
siness is an effort to compete in the attention war. =E2=80=9CMeans to an e=
nd is how I approach iteration. And podcasts were a means to an attention-w=
inning end.=E2=80=9D

=09Seeing like a rock-onomist :: The pandemic has=
 accelerated trends and changed the behaviors of consumers and businesses a=
like. To see around corners, ask the question: When the pandemic ends, how =
might these before and after behaviors coexist? For example, in the music i=
ndustry, during COVID-19, the streaming business has grown, but the live mu=
sic business imploded. Artists have successfully embraced technology to hos=
t livestreamed performances. Live music will come back after COVID-19, but =
livestreaming won=E2=80=99t simply go away. Thus, Page is thinking about ho=
w these will coexist and how they might complement rather than compete with=
 each other. =E2=80=9COften, a traditional business mindset will see things=
 as a threat. But a rock-onomist=E2=80=99s job is to see that as an opportu=
nity.=E2=80=9D

=09Be misunderstood :: While discussing having a long-t=
erm mindset for innovation, Page recalled hearing Jeff Bezos say to =
=E2=80=9Cbe prepared to be misunderstood for generations.=E2=80=9D One of A=
mazon=E2=80=99s earliest acquisitions was IMDb, and the fruits of that are =
just now appearing. If you pause a movie on Amazon Prime Video, you can see=
 the names of the actors in the scene and information about the song playin=
g in the background. =E2=80=9CThat is an example of somebody thinking long =
term to say, =E2=80=98How do you enrich the experience of watching a movie =
on their sofa in a way you can=E2=80=99t do in the cinema?=E2=80=99=
=E2=80=9D Page challenged members, asking: =E2=80=9CWhat would be your =
=E2=80=98IMDb acquisition=E2=80=99=E2=80=94where you really have to think d=
ecades ahead before you see the fruits of it or before you can yield that i=
nvestment back?=E2=80=9D

<ul>
=09<li><strong>Changing course :=
:</strong>&nbsp;As the new CEO of Harley-Davidson, Zeitz was charged with t=
ransforming the legendary brand for the future. While Harley-Davidson=
=E2=80=99s iconic&nbsp;<em>Easy Rider</em>-influenced brand built a loyal c=
ustomer base, many customers are aging and hesitant to see the company evol=
ve. Meanwhile, there=E2=80=99s a large group of potential customers who are=
n=E2=80=99t attracted to the traditional Harley brand, as they have differe=
nt aspirations from the core customers. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s the dichoto=
my we need to address with a specific strategy that still delivers what the=
 core wants but also reaches out with new and exciting products, language a=
nd messaging that=E2=80=99s quite different.=E2=80=9D One part of this stra=
tegy is the electric motorcycle, which reaches out to new customers by prov=
iding =E2=80=9Cthe Harley look and feel=E2=80=9D but in a modern, sustainab=
le way.</li>
=09<li><strong>Starting from scratch ::</strong>&nbsp;Althou=
gh the road to building the electric motorcycle could rely on Harley-Davids=
on=E2=80=99s brand name and legacy, said Zeitz, =E2=80=9CEverything else is=
 starting from scratch. So I look at this venture as a startup, and we need=
 to structure it that way.=E2=80=9D This creates challenges, as different m=
etrics are needed for the nascent electric part of the business and the tra=
ditional part of the business, which is driving revenue. =E2=80=9CYou don=
=E2=80=99t want to cannibalize your traditional business by taking your eye=
 off the ball, but you know to compete in electric, you need a completely d=
ifferent mindset, mentality and focus.=E2=80=9D The motorcycle industry is =
behind the auto industry in embracing electricity, but the market will move=
 in that direction. =E2=80=9CThis is a long-term play. We have to think in =
decades rather than years.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><strong>Welcome the=
 criticism ::&nbsp;</strong>While some traditionalists in the motorcycle sp=
ace might denounce the idea of an electric motorcycle, Zeitz observed that =
this criticism comes with the territory of innovation. Any truly innovative=
 product=E2=80=94from the first cell phones to the Tesla=E2=80=94inevitably=
 faces a host of criticism at first. =E2=80=9CIf you want to lead and innov=
ate, from my perspective, the more resistance you get, the bigger you are i=
n terms of innovation,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYou just have to keep at =
it, and do the right things.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><strong>Driving c=
hange through business ::</strong>&nbsp;=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve learned in my=
 career that business, while it does a lot of good, does a lot of harm, too=
, from a social and environmental point of view,=E2=80=9D said Zeitz. But, =
business has a huge opportunity to solve the major problems plaguing the wo=
rld. Zeitz co-founded The B Team with Sir Richard Branson to activate the t=
ransformative power of business in solving global problems and to reframe s=
ustainability as an opportunity rather than a responsibility. The B Team=
=E2=80=99s recent work focuses on promoting an inclusive stakeholder approa=
ch, which Zeitz is implementing at Harley-Davidson, as he did at Puma. Whil=
e he acknowledged that large-scale transformation is a long-term process, h=
e said: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a realistic optimist. =E2=80=A6 We=E2=80=99re =
starting to realize what the problems are and starting to find solutions. I=
 remain optimistic that we
can solve the issues we=E2=80=99re facing.=

spective is,=E2=80=9D said Noah, =E2=80=9Cthat contrary to popular belief, =
the world is not ending. And so, until the world ends, we can enjoy being h=
uman beings and still pay attention to everything going on around us.=
=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Make a new show ::</strong>&nbsp;When COVID=
-19 hit,&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show</em>=E2=80=99s creative team had to determ=
ine how to produce the program remotely and what it would look like without=
 a studio audience. Rather than focusing on the absence of his normal audie=
nce, Noah chose to get into the mindset that he was making a new show from =
his new reality. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve tried to do: wor=
k within my reality.=E2=80=9D He even renamed the show&nbsp;<em>The Daily S=
ocial Distancing Show</em>&nbsp;as a reminder: =E2=80=9Cso that I, myself, =
would always remember that this is a specific thing that I=E2=80=99m doing =
because life is not normal.=E2=80=9D A member later echoed Noah=E2=80=99s c=
omments about leading through this crisis, saying, =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re a=
ll making new shows, so to speak.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=
=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B</li>
=09<li><strong>Fueled by fire starters :=
:&nbsp;</strong>Asked what inspires his creativity, Noah emphasized the imp=
ortance of being surrounded by funny, creative people. When he=E2=80=99s fe=
eling uninspired, someone around him will inevitably say something that set=
s off =E2=80=9Can avalanche=E2=80=9D of jokes and humor, which reignites th=
e creative spark. =E2=80=9CAll I keep trying to do is make sure the group h=
as enough people in it who are fire starters, enough people who aren=
=E2=80=99t afraid to spark a joke, spark an idea, get something going.=
=E2=80=9D The team=E2=80=99s witty, intelligent conversations inform the sh=
ow=E2=80=99s conversational format. =E2=80=9CThe show is a conversation tha=
t is going on with the audience, so we try to maintain that energy througho=
ut.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Everybody is your customer ::&nbsp;</str=
ong>When Noah arrived at&nbsp;<em>The Daily Show,</em>&nbsp;he focused on c=
hanging the show=E2=80=99s distribution because he realized that people=
=E2=80=99s viewing habits were gradually shifting. He put the show=E2=80=
=99s content on all platforms=E2=80=94from Snapchat and TikTok to YouTube a=
nd Instagram=E2=80=94to meet audiences where they are and to draw in new vi=
ewers. He also made sure the show engaged viewers through the linear TV pla=
tform but also sought to engage people who don=E2=80=99t watch TV at all. =
=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s almost part of your customer base, even if they=
=E2=80=99re not your customer,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CEverybody can be =
a customer; they just aren=E2=80=99t right now.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>
=09<l=
i><strong>The formula for comedy ::&nbsp;</strong>Comedy has a formula: tra=
gedy plus time, said Noah. =E2=80=9CAs long as you have enough time that se=
parates you enough from the tragedy, no matter how small or big it is, you=
=E2=80=99ll be able to laugh at it. The issue is right now we live in a wor=
ld where the tragedy is ongoing.=E2=80=9D People don=E2=80=99t know what to=
 laugh at anymore because they have no distance from the tragic reality. =
=E2=80=9CThey cannot laugh at the absurdity because the absurd has become t=
he real. That=E2=80=99s a very strange place to be in.=E2=80=9D He observed=
 that in more relaxed times, comedy tends to become much edgier, but in edg=
ier times, comedy has to be =E2=80=9Cmore of a soothing balm so people can =
get through their day.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Empowering through te=
ch ::</strong>&nbsp;Recalling the life-changing day in his childhood when h=
is mother brought home a computer, Noah said, =E2=80=9CI was just learning =
the command prompts, but the world was infinite.=E2=80=9D Having experience=
d how empowering access to technology can be, Noah launched the Trevor Noah=
 Foundation in South Africa, which seeks to equip schools to reach their fu=
ll potential by providing the resources, equipment and training they need. =
=E2=80=9CSometimes people create technology for what they need, not for wha=
t the people they=E2=80=99re giving it to need,=E2=80=9D he said. Thus, the=
 foundation works with its partner Microsoft to bring tech to each school t=
hrough a human-centered design method that focuses on the school=E2=80=
=99s specific needs. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m trying to get to a place where =
=E2=80=A6 every school is connected, every student is connected and hopeful=
ly everyone has an equal
shot at a good education.=E2=80=9D</li>

<ul>
=09<li><strong>A fashion emergency ::</strong>=
&nbsp;Before COVID-19, Rent the Runway was on a 10-year =E2=80=9Crocket-shi=
p growth path,=E2=80=9D building the =E2=80=9Ccloset in the cloud=E2=80=
=9D for its many customers. As the virus disrupted China=E2=80=99s fashion =
supply chains in January, the company quickly sought to mitigate inventory =
shortages. By mid-March, inventory had arrived, but shelter-in-place orders=
 were enacted, decimating Rent the Runway=E2=80=99s demand. Faced with no r=
evenue and many fixed costs, Hyman had to act swiftly to save the company s=
he founded, slashing costs and making difficult people decisions. =E2=80=
=9CIt was a traumatic eight-day experience,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI h=
ad to do everything possible to not only save the business but to save the =
passion and the work of the thousands of people who=E2=80=99ve partnered wi=
th me over the last decade to build this industry-leading company.=E2=80=
=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Alter your view ::</strong>&nbsp;In the past, emp=
loyees came to work at the fast-growing company expecting to manage lots of=
 successful projects and to rise in their roles and responsibilities quickl=
y. When the business changed almost overnight, Hyman had to reframe how emp=
loyees saw their jobs in order to prevent mass attrition and motivate them =
through the crisis. =E2=80=9CI had to convince people that their jobs were =
to learn how to connect emotionally with folks on their team, how to inspir=
e people around them, how to ruthlessly prioritize what they=E2=80=99re wor=
king on, how to figure out how to do more with less.=E2=80=9D She champione=
d the idea of resilient leadership and emphasized that every employee is re=
sponsible for it.&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><strong>Address the existential quest=
ions ::&nbsp;</strong>Faced with an existential crisis, Hyman and her team =
asked themselves two essential questions that guided their strategy during =
COVID-19 and provided an outlook for a post-pandemic future:&nbsp;
=09<ol=
>
=09=09<li><strong>Will your business still be relevant after COVID-19?&=
nbsp;</strong>The whole world is suffering from the same crisis at the same=
 time, and this is fundamentally changing our values, how we live and how w=
e work. =E2=80=9CThese trends are not necessarily going away.=E2=80=9D Afte=
r pondering the question, Hyman determined that Rent the Runway still had a=
 place in a post-COVID-19 world. =E2=80=9CYes, I think creating a sharing e=
conomy in a closet in the cloud is still relevant.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09=09<l=
i><strong>Coming out of COVID-19, will your business be more relevant or le=
ss relevant than it was before?&nbsp;</strong>Consider the shifting values =
and trends during the pandemic, such as sustainability and digital accelera=
tion. On sustainability, she said, =E2=80=9CMy company is squarely the most=
 sustainable way to get dressed.=E2=80=9D Apparel has been one of the slowe=
st industries to embrace digital commerce, but 99% of Rent the Runway=
=E2=80=99s sales already happen online. Seeing these trends, Hyman realized=
 her company was positioned to be even bigger coming out of the crisis.</li=
>
=09</ol>
=09</li>
=09<li><strong>The next trend ::&nbsp;</strong>Th=
e fashion industry=E2=80=99s biggest upcoming trend is the transition towar=
d becoming truly sustainable. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s part of the thesis we=
 have that the circular economy is going to be an even bigger part of the f=
ashion industry going forward.=E2=80=9D A small but growing part of Rent th=
e Runway=E2=80=99s business was selling second-hand clothes, and Hyman deci=
ded to expand the business model and position the company as the platform f=
or the circular economy in fashion=E2=80=94as the place where =E2=80=9Ca cu=
stomer can come and decide, with every unit of inventory, whether you want =
to rent it, subscribe to it or purchase it.=E2=80=9D While many companies j=
ettisoned ancillary businesses during the pandemic, Rent the Runway did the=
 opposite by =E2=80=9Cwidening the aperture of the value proposition.=
=E2=80=9D She said, =E2=80=9CEven though the short term is going to suck, l=
et=E2=80=99s make sure that we
prioritize to come out of this to more str=
ongly capture a much larger opportunity.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Map=
ping the mood ::</strong>&nbsp;Rent the Runway=E2=80=99s analytics team ref=
ined customer data by geography throughout the pandemic, revealing signific=
ant regional differences in customers=E2=80=99 outlook. In states like Texa=
s, Georgia and Florida, Rent the Runway=E2=80=99s business is accelerating,=
 and almost 75% of customers in those markets have returned despite high CO=
VID-19 case numbers. The opposite effect is happening in states like Califo=
rnia and New York. =E2=80=9CEven though the rates of COVID are much lower i=
n New York right now than in Georgia,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cthe psych=
ology of the consumer is fundamentally different in New York, and she=
=E2=80=99s not yet ready to resume her life as normal.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>=

=09<=
li><strong>Listen out for signals ::&nbsp;</strong>Be wary about relying to=
o heavily on data when you=E2=80=99re trying to see ahead and detect future=
 risks and opportunities. =E2=80=9CRemember that all data comes from the sa=
me place: the past,=E2=80=9D said Page. Be open to exploring new signals=
=E2=80=94even seemingly unusual ones=E2=80=94in the present that may shed l=
ight on the future. For example, in 2018, the Bank of England=E2=80=99s chi=
ef economist wanted to use Spotify=E2=80=99s data to help predict the next =
recession. He wanted to understand what was happening in the economy at tha=
t very moment, and he wanted to look for signals of anxiety in Spotify=
=E2=80=99s listener data. =E2=80=9CAnxiety could have a much bigger impact =
on how the economy responds to a crisis than last quarter=E2=80=99s manufac=
turing output data.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Data science needs commo=
n sense ::</strong>&nbsp;Page warned that data strategies must be supplemen=
ted by common sense, as data dashboards tend to overlook common-sense obser=
vations. When Spotify launched its Discover Weekly playlists, Page worked c=
losely with the data team, but then he met with the customer support team. =
From that, he learned that customers would call to ask why&nbsp;<em>Frozen<=
/em>&nbsp;songs were appearing on their Discover Weekly playlists, and that=
 the support team would realize these customers had children and would succ=
essfully sell them a family plan. =E2=80=9CThe customization of Discover We=
ekly =E2=80=A6 was driving the commerce of the family plan,=E2=80=9D he sai=
d, but the =E2=80=9Ctunnel vision=E2=80=9D of the data scientists didn=
=E2=80=99t see this connection. Only by listening to the customer and apply=
ing common sense could anyone uncover that opportunity. =E2=80=9CA chief da=
ta
scientist is employed to study data, but you need to counterbalance th=
at with the people who produce that data. That=E2=80=99s the link I encoura=
ge you to close.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</li>
=09<li><strong>The war for attention=
 ::</strong>&nbsp;Every platform is fighting a war for users=E2=80=99 atten=
tion. =E2=80=9CIf Netflix gets me to binge-watch three times 10 episodes of=
&nbsp;<em>Narcos</em>, which I did,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthat=
=E2=80=99s 30 hours that music doesn=E2=80=99t see, that Facebook or Instag=
ram doesn=E2=80=99t see.=E2=80=9D Netflix has won the attention war for 30 =
hours. Page believes that companies must start by gaining attention and the=
n move on from there. =E2=80=9CIf I win your attention, I can win lots of o=
ther things.=E2=80=9D While people are paying for and listening to music, m=
usic is =E2=80=9Cjust wallpaper,=E2=80=9D so Spotify needed a new way to ca=
pture users=E2=80=99 attention. Listening to a podcast requires paying more=
 attention than listening to music does, so Spotify=E2=80=99s move into the=
 podcast business is an effort to compete in the attention war. =E2=80=
=9CMeans to an end is how I approach iteration. And podcasts were a
means=
 to an attention-winning end.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li><strong>Seeing like a =
rock-onomist ::</strong>&nbsp;The pandemic has accelerated trends and chang=
ed the behaviors of consumers and businesses alike. To see around corners, =
ask the question: When the pandemic ends, how might these before and after =
behaviors coexist? For example, in the music industry, during COVID-19, the=
 streaming business has grown, but the live music business imploded. Artist=
s have successfully embraced technology to host livestreamed performances. =
Live music will come back after COVID-19, but livestreaming won=E2=80=99t s=
imply go away. Thus, Page is thinking about how these will coexist and how =
they might complement rather than compete with each other. =E2=80=9COften, =
a traditional business mindset will see things as a threat. But a rock-onom=
ist=E2=80=99s job is to see that as an opportunity.=E2=80=9D</li>
=09<li>=
<strong>Be misunderstood ::&nbsp;</strong>While discussing having a long-te=
rm mindset for innovation, Page recalled hearing Jeff Bezos say to =
=E2=80=9Cbe prepared to be misunderstood for generations.=E2=80=9D One of A=
mazon=E2=80=99s earliest acquisitions was IMDb, and the fruits of that are =
just now appearing. If you pause a movie on Amazon Prime Video, you can see=
 the names of the actors in the scene and information about the song playin=
g in the background. =E2=80=9CThat is an example of somebody thinking long =
term to say, =E2=80=98How do you enrich the experience of watching a movie =
on their sofa in a way you can=E2=80=99t do in the cinema?=E2=80=99=
=E2=80=9D Page challenged members, asking: =E2=80=9CWhat would be your =
=E2=80=98IMDb acquisition=E2=80=99=E2=80=94where you really have to think d=
ecades ahead before you see the fruits of it or before you can yield that i=
nvestment back?=E2=80=9D</li>
