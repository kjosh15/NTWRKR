 At the W50 event last night Don Weinstein of ADP pointedly brought up to a
group of folks that he's looking for low cost digital startups - stuff that
links back to core services but is slightly different. It's called
the "Purple Hippos" project so people know it's not the core brand.

This guy is rude. I don't particularly like him. But if you think they're a
strong potential candidate for funding I can certainly reach out. Thoughts?
