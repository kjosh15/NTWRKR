I think we've avoided the website cost, yes. We'll see if there are strings
attached after I speak with Michael Monday.

As for Steve, I'd like to see him contribute something other than cash. I
know he's a good network, but am not keen to lose more equity for such
small stakes - as you said, let's crank the main raise instead.

In terms of spend, I'm leaning more and more into the GAnalytics analogy
and farther from video. I know, I know! But something we should discuss in
terms of what we present to potential investors. I think that having strong
options and clear tests counts for a lot here, esp. given that we have a
track record of success now.

More Monday,
Josh
