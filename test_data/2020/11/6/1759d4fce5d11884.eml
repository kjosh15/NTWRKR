Saw you on the Brady Bunch Bar at the I50 Summit yesterday and wanted to
follow up and say hi. No agenda, but if you'd like to compare notes on
new/emerging tech and what's latest at Constellation I'd be happy to
connect for a brief call - the serendipitous connections at W50 have always
been my favorite, and what I miss most in this pandemic. Let me know!

All best,
Josh
