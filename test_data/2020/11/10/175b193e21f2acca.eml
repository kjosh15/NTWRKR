Finally got some feedback from a couple different shipping companies, and
they've all said that pricing depends on total # of boxes and estimated
weight. On the plus side, we've learned that the shipping will likely take
between 2-4 weeks, so we should aim for the end of the month to have at
least the "Ship Now" stuff sent so the kids can have their toys and needed
supplies before XMas. Let's talk this through!

Separately, we have a friend in the building who is finally getting repairs
in their apartment done. So I'm guessing the landlord is more amenable to
negotiating now!

Let me know when you're available to chat,
Josh
