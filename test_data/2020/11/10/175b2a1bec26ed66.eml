Good to see you again! Appreciate you making the time - as you noted, no
time for BS calls anymore. Sounds like life is treating you well (all
things considered.) Let me know what the future holds - super keen to see
what you do with the expert advisory board idea / move to Norway / etc.
These are strange times indeed...

Would be curious what Steve makes of it all - we'd love to find a US
partner who could run with our data in providing advisory services to
corporations!!

All best,
Josh
