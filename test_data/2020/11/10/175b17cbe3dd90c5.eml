Thanks, Geoff! Congrats on the move (and the green card), along with the
consulting and real estate practice. We're in Iceland at the moment, but
when/if we return to the tri-state area we'll be looking you up...

In the meantime, I have two things I'd be curious to get your take on:

1. I co-founded IndigoMetrics.com and since Covid we've been seeing
tremendous growth. The reason I ask you about it is your Metrics are
Bullshit rant - this startup is solely founded on metrics, and intends to
use them to improve work for employees and employers alike. I've always
been impressed with your clear thinking on these topics; would you be
interested/available to briefly talk this one over?

2. I'd love to talk to Ben Moskowitz. IndigoMetrics is growing fast, but
we're still self funded. :)

All best,
Josh
