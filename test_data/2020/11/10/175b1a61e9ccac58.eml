Today is packed up, unfortunately, but I can summarize:

The big outcome was that zoom conferences are total shit for networking.
I've got a number of meetings scheduled / being scheduled, but no clear
evidence of appetite (mostly because the topic of outsourcing/expanding
innovation efforts wasn't brought up by the speakers.)

At this point I think we either look to be opportunistic, and if I come
across someone who needs Normative's offering I can make the connection for
a % of the resulting deal, or we can set up an agreement and I start doing
some deliberate outreach/scoping work. Unless you can think of some other
setup? As per our prior conversations, I'd love to work on some of your
product development projects!

Let me know where you're at on the above, and/or if a short call would make
sense. If so, would noon EST Friday or 2pm EST Monday work?
