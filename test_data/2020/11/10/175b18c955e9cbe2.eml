&gt; Moving the tech into other user areas, and not strictly for the disabl=
ed, TSK can incorporate saliva reading tech for various illness and also th=
e technology that reads air quality for those in the sport crowd that might=
 want to use it in their exercise/jogging
 regime and get read outs to their smartphone alerting them to things like =
&quot;the highway route you are jogging is causing a large inhalation of CO=
2 and monoxide&quot; or some such thing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The other application is the gaming world, which would give the user y=
et another &quot;hand&quot; in the game for what they do. I&#39;m not a gam=
er. It could also be used in some capacity for up-screen technologies in a =
military capacity, hands free commands/scoping for
 those with a lot in their hands.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The concept regarding Pulmonary Embolism (P.E) is really no more than =
a foam pad with sensors that goes on your car seat. It&#39;s actually a lot=
 closer to what Orpyx does with Insoles,,, my working name for the product =
is &quot;Ass-sole&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; While picking the brains of the specialists tending my stay in the hos=
pital, which coincidently is a forerunner hospital in all things cardiac, r=
espiratory and pulmonary, they gave me a greater understanding of Electroca=
rdiograms and why they don&#39;t always
 register things. There&#39;s a commercial Google APP for a thumbed unit bu=
t that is too sporadic a usage; the foam pad on the seat would be reading a=
ll blood pressure, temperature changes from both legs independently during =
Stop/Go cycles, swerving, slowing, speeding,
 fidgeting of the driver. Weight shifting across our mid-rift and slumped d=
riving could also be detected in the drive. Being that their are so many bo=
dy types, there is still a general area where our ass and legs lay upon the=
 seat and would be the best area
 for bodily contact.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For fleet vehicles, the pads would be assigned a driver that workday t=
o keep their diagnostic personal; a change user feature could be interfaced=
 via a smartphone if another driver plops down on it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Minor thrombosis from sitting is commonplace but as mentioned, also a =
major cause for a range of pulmonary disorders for frequent flyers and driv=
ers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The pad, would be a first step towards future models to better underst=
and blood flow, pressure, etc... and aside from the health research, would =
assist auto manufacturers address different manner of a car seat. Future mo=
dels could incorporate many pneumatic
 inflated/deflated bladders within it to relieve pressure points and stimul=
ate blood flow, similar to hospital beds now that adjust to stave off bed s=
ores for long term laying.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Josh, the pulmonary pad concept is still very fresh and the more likel=
y of the two of moving forward with Orpyx. TSK, not as likely but I&#39;m s=
till going to pitch it,, I really like concepts that create inclusion and o=
nly later seeing it&#39;s potential for gamers
 or the fit-bit crowd, think I might be able to farm it out further,, so if=
 it fails at Orpyx, I&#39;ll be sending you a &quot;Hello from the future&q=
uot; email.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If you have any questions further, email is sufficing well. My text au=
to-fill/correct is possessed so answering via that manner would be comical =
at best.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi Josh,<br>
&gt; &gt; The company I will be approaching for my two projects is Orpyx. W=
hen I opened your email last week, there were two very glaring reasons why =
I think you should connect with this company; firstly, they have the sensor=
 technology specific to diabetes as that&#39;s
 the core of what they address. Secondly, they are well underway, on the ot=
her side of the fence on all the medical/hospital bureaucracy for lack of b=
etter words. I&#39;ll post their web link below, for you to get a feel for =
them and I can&#39;t express this enough,
 look at their team. Being that your concept is much closer to their core a=
ddress than to mine, you could approach them solo,, I had thought about tag=
 teaming your concept along with mine but then reconsidered this as it tend=
s to muddle focus, nobody really
 likes pot pourri.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll just nutshell my two concepts here as my presentations a=
re in a format specific to Orpyx. Initially, the reason I wanted to reach o=
ut to them regards a concept I had in 2004, had an oral evaluation by James=
 Levine at Watson Labs and was deemed of (at
 that time) that the technology needed wasn&#39;t yet available. Over the y=
ears since then, not only has the tech come to par but exceeded it with oth=
er technologies that can be worked in, and of course Big Data and all such =
things. That concept is to assist paraplegics
 and quadriplegics not only maneuver their equipment and chairs with greate=
r ease but affordably manipulate their mouse on their computer and/or smart=
phone at near par of you or I. Other aspects of that unit would provide rea=
l-time data of their immediate health
 and covid or similar to their doctors or researchers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The second concept has real-world background; this past July, aft=
er a series of tests to figure out something with irregularities in my hear=
t function, I caught on that something was about to occur following a test.=
 Went to emergency and they took me directly
 into the hospital where I spent a week. The doctors said that; had I ignor=
ed what was happening and went to bed, I would have either awoken while hav=
ing a stroke, woken with a stroke or not woken at all. Very sobering. What =
was funny was, I was to have a teleconferencing
 regarding the other concept with a venture firm that were going to help me=
 see other avenues in my presentation of it. But there I laid in a hospital=
 bed, not only picking the specialists brains for my own health but to bett=
er understand to better address
 how to have others avert such a catastrophe.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The reason for my near stroke; all the tests that were being perf=
ormed regarded my heart, which tests kept coming back as very healthy. It w=
as a stress test on a treadmill in the morning that kicked in my near strok=
e in the afternoon. The doctor at that
 clinic said &quot;your heart is fine, you can go home&quot;. My heart was =
fine according to the hospital specialists, however, the branches into my l=
ungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And had the cardiologists and pulmonary specialists not let me kn=
ow why this happened, I wouldn&#39;t have set out to create this concept. I=
t was so shocking (not post-covid related anything) that I replied in half =
words with head shakes; Excessive Driving.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; My job at that time was setting up a western office for a larger =
eastern Canadian company and involved at least 1500+ KM&#39;s a week to ser=
vice and acquaint with customers.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Depending on body type and we hear of this common thrombosis occu=
rrence on frequent flyers, frequent driving creates a myriad of major healt=
h issues. Stepping on the gas, stopping at a red light and repeating the cy=
cles within a day, plus distance, sitting,
 creates compression. Some people get numb leg, some get heart palpitations=
,,, which, like me, were brushed off to coffee intake over the workday and =
common work stress.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That concept is fairly straightforward, but I see something other=
 in it than ones health; it can provide true big-data on what automobiles a=
re worse for long distances. This could serve companies creating fleets, or=
 auto-manufacturers redesigning car/truck
 seats, researchers better understand compression thrombosis,, it could, if=
 worked with your Indigo AI (this just popped into my head) to give other u=
nderstandings of &quot;Well Being&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Josh, last week while we were email tagging, I was being directed=
 by my doctor and another specialist to go to labs for more blood-work and =
other unpleasant tests. Because of covid, labs are backed up and it was lik=
e a scene from a bad treasure hunt movie,
 trying to get same day tests, fasting for one only not to get a test and t=
hen trying to figure out another moment to fast again, yet eat. All&#39;s g=
ood now before the next series of follow up work. That was last week, it wa=
s comical.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I have some morning things to take care of but my afternoon is fr=
ee, as well as Tuesday and Wednesday all day.<br>
