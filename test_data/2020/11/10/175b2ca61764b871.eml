striking as I've been building a TV show based on their GPT-3 technology =
- a show in which an AI independently talks with people about today's =
most divisive issues... and attempts to change their mind.<br =

a world where things aren't completely real so you can deal with what is =
real" and that "the show is a conversation going on with the audience." =
