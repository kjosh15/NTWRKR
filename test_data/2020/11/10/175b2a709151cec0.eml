Wow, Indigometrics looks really cool!  Have you been able to apply your
tool to issues around racial equity?

Ah -- chatbots -- that's actually a direction that we've wanted to look
into; we imagine eventually being a service that you can text.  Right now
we have trygravy.com/hotline set up to field this type of thing, but
eventually we'd love to somehow automate learning and responding.

And yes, talked to Pinto a while back and definitely watching their
progress -- what they're doing is really neat.
