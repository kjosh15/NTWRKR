Karen Rivoire, my contact at IKEA, asked about your research into human
monitoring through space to encourage movement/wellness. I'd explained
about the project we did RFID tagging our family's clothing and monitoring
everything for three months, and explained that you were considering
launching a venture to study how the relationship between spaces and
movement can be personalized/calculated, and that it had occurred to me
that IKEA could really benefit. She asked for a quick doc to send to Space
10 <https://space10.com/>, one of their labs.
