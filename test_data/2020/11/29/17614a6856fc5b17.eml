Chris,

I was working through some NACD material and was reminded that ESG is a
HUGE issue even still for most big companies. It got me thinking that, like
D&I, having a "ESG pack" of values might be of significant value. If we
could offer benchmarking materials like this which a company can use over
time, as needed, I think we could expedite adoption. What's more, if we can
create an autonomous cycling process where new values "drift" into and out
of the total set being assessed we could potentially offer a larger, or
multiple, sets of values.

I.e., if we offered that the customer buy "ESG, D&I, and Innovation" value
sets, and have the platform dynamically rotate these such that over the
course of the year we have a regular and comprehensive view of where the
company rests relative to these issues, I think we'd be able to offer
something irresistible.  No?

- J

 P.S. I was also reminded that the largest nonfinancial metric used for
setting CEO compensation is employee engagement. Makes me think that we may
be hitting a hidden iceberg here.
