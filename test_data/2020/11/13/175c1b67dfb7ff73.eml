Pinging you one last time: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, =
and to see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and =
the view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call!

All best,
Josh

totally outside your interest Click here(http://tracking.josh.=

you in the future!

Below are a few of my =

with an update on what you're working on. Or let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for =
autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if =
you've got staff that are now remote!

; a project to understand how to use=
 physically embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart=
 disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

: as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
