Change =E2=80=9Cemail #=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9C1.1, 1.2, 1.3=E2=80=9D for eac=
h followup
That way can:

1. sort by email # to see total history, or
2. sort by open rates to get best headlines, or
3. sort by clickthrough to get best message body in each sequence. Note it
may to mix up sequence. (Experiment!)

Another idea: change followup times to 5, 7, and then 10 days. I.e., give
more time to followup the longer the sequence goes.

Don=E2=80=99t forget to move back the outreach rate to throttle throughput!=
!

Love,
Josh
