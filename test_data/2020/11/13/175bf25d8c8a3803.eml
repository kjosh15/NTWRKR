Joshua,

I keep putting this off because I know it's a huge painin the butt. 
However, we have to start somewhere,So I thought I'd at least begin a 
dialog.

First, I am sorry to foist this off on you. However, I have been 
thinking about this for years and there are two underlying reasons why 
it makes sense to me: First, should I become incapacitated, your mother 
would have no idea as how to deal with her e-mail when (not if) 
something went awry and, second, should my incapacity continue, you 
would have access to my email and could use it as necessary to find 
people, places, documents, et cetera.

With that left-handed compliment/excuse let me begin to enumerate some 
of the many details we will need to clean up this matter.

We own 3 URLs -

KarenKleinArt.com (I think this is the name - your mother uses so many 
iterations of her name and art that I mix them up if I don't use them 
for some months)

TheKleins.US (there may be a hyphen in here; The-Kleins.US)

AGoodDay.today

The only active URL is your mother's art site. TheKleins.US is under the 
'Artist site. We used to be able to see it as KarenKleinArt.com/TheKleins.US

AGoodDay.today is a Go-Daddy held URL. It is set up so the email goes to 
the 'Artist site and is hosted as imap accounts there.

Your mother doesn't want to continue the 'Artist - too hard for her to 
maintain, so very out-of-date. I offered that if there was a simple 
interface, we might want to have a web site to post family pics & videos 
to. Otherwise, we can drop the 'Artist and 'Klein URLs and keep the 
AGoodDay.today for email only. We talked about eliminating this and 
using a simpler e-mail address. However, when we established it, I kept 
my old e-mail address and did the "This e-mail has been changed..." for 
TWO YEARS! When I dropped the old e-mail; address, I got 'phone calls, 
"Your email doesn't work...". I told your mother that at 79 I don't want 
to spend 5 years trying to get our ageing friends to change our e-mail 
addresses. In addition, I would spend a lot of time, first with all my 
web sites, updating contact/username info and, second, what would seem 
like an even longer time trying to straighten out your mother's sites.

Okay, there's a start. I now have to confirm the actual site names, etc. 
and get that to you. I can provide admin info for HostMySite, e-mail 
access if needed and so on.

Have you any initial thoughts as to how to proceed and where we should 
try to end up?

Love,

DAD
