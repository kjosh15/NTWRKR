Spoke to Carl;


   1. Their demand system is being upgraded right now, which is (possibly)
   why momentum on RFID is slow
   2. He'll reach out to the former CEO of Oakly, now their new head of
   retail in US, about his take on RFID and how to bring it forward from th=
e
   back-end supply chain.
   3. He asked for some slides on case studies of the value of RFID through
   the front of the house


He also wanted to keep in touch about new tech developments more generally.
My take was that he'll do a little outreach but doesn't want to rock the
boat as they have a new head of digital coming in January and he wants to
have all his cards in hand when they do. I'd suggest we get him 4-5 slides
on case studies for RFID that'll arm him / entice him to the full-stack
data chain AD can provide to push on it in the background (possibly through
an alliance with said new head of retail) before then.

Let me know what you think,
Josh
