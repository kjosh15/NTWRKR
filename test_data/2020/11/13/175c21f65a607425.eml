All good reasons and all make sense to me. Here's the How To
<https://mediatemple.net/community/products/all/204405294/how-do-i-transfer=
-my-domain-registration-to-or-from-media-temple>
for bringing a domain name to my current provider. Here's the (easiest)
steps:

0) Generate a list of all your domain names and email accounts.
1) Give me login permissions to your current hosting provider.
2) Backup all your email locally, unless it's currently being hosted by
google or a separate external provider.

Then I'll move everything over. You'll have to upload any email unless
you're storing it locally via POP. No hassle in any of this; as noted your
thinking is sound and I'm happy to keep the domains on my hosting package.

Love,
Josh

<br>
We own 3 URLs -<br>
<br>
KarenKleinArt.com (I think this is the name - your mother uses so many <br>

TheKleins.US (there may be a hyphen in here; The-Kleins.US)<br>

The only active URL is your mother&#39;s art site. TheKleins.US is under th=

&#39;Artist site. We used to be able to see it as KarenKleinArt.com/TheKlei=

<br>
AGoodDay.today is a Go-Daddy held URL. It is set up so the email goes to <b=

<br>
Your mother doesn&#39;t want to continue the &#39;Artist - too hard for her=
 to <br>
