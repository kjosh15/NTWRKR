Hello, and welcome to the group!

It's a good idea to start tossing out some peanuts now so that your local 
corvids will have time to find them, and to hopefully make your location 
one of their regular stops on foraging runs. Since you are still waiting on 
parts, it's a perfect time to get this process started so that you have a 
better chance of having regular corvid visitors by the time you deploy your 
Crowbox. A short article on site preparation can be found 
here: http://thecrowbox.com/wiki/doku.php?id=kit:site_preparation

Here are some answers to your questions:

1) I never actually weighed any of the Crowboxes I built. I estimate the 
weight is under 2kg (probably around 1.5) when loaded with peanuts. In 
other words, not very heavy when it comes to making decisions about 
mounting.

2) Based on all of the testing we have done, corvids seem to prefer an 
elevated location where they can stand in a tree, on a fence, or on the 
roofline of a building near the Crowbox. This gives them a secure and safe 
place to stand and observe the Crowbox as they decide to start interacting 
with it. An article on this topic is available on the Crowbox 
Wiki: http://thecrowbox.com/wiki/doku.php?id=kit:location_selection

3) We've seen plenty of Steller's Jays use our Crowbox prototypes. Our 
primary test location had far more Steller's Jays than Crows and so a large 
number of our visitors were Jays. I'm also aware of a user who has recorded 
Western Scrub Jays using their Crowbox.
