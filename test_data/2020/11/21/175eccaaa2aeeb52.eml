Hey! I posted a while back about working through some design changes that I=
=20
think will work better for colder/harsher climates. I=E2=80=99ve done that,=
 built a=20
couple tests, and have made some revisions to make sure it=E2=80=99s workin=
g well=20
and holds up to the project tenets.

I=E2=80=99ve a final laser cutting on the way that I=E2=80=99ll build and m=
ake any final=20
adjustments from, but I=E2=80=99m considering these as an unofficial =E2=80=
=9Cv3.1=E2=80=9D design=20
(version 3 since they aren=E2=80=99t backwards compatible, and revision 1 b=
ecause=20
I=E2=80=99ve done an alpha and beta build).

I=E2=80=99m not expecting any level of official adoption of these designs, =
but it=E2=80=99s=20
always a nice warm feeling to know that others can benefit from my efforts.

I=E2=80=99ve created a GitHub repo <https://github.com/jejacks0n/crowbox> a=
nd=20
encourage one of the core members to send me a GitHub account so I can=20
transfer this repo to you (I=E2=80=99ll rewrite the initial commits to be y=
ours as=20
well). Since it=E2=80=99s a CC/ShareAlike license, I want to contribute bac=
k, but=20
don=E2=80=99t really know how best to. After transferring it, I=E2=80=99ll =
move my design=20
tweaks to my own fork, and others can do the same if they=E2=80=99re so inc=
lined --=20
or if it's not worth doing, I'll make it clear it's not at all official=20
repo. I know using something like git is maybe a complexity, but if it=E2=
=80=99s an=20
open source project, I tend to think people who *can* contribute will=20
probably understand how to, or would be willing to learn. I also think it=
=20
would be a useful place to migrate the wiki to, but understand if that=E2=
=80=99s=20
not part of the goals.

I=E2=80=99ve really tried to make sure this design is as solid as current, =
with=20
hopefully an improvement here and there -- there's some trade offs for=20
sure. I=E2=80=99ve enjoyed hacking on this, so thanks to everyone who=E2=80=
=99s contributed=20
thus far. =3D)

I added the CRoS source to the repo as well, because I=E2=80=99m planning t=
o add=20
support for the wifi rev2 hardware that I=E2=80=99m using. My goals here ar=
e mostly=20
around event tracking capabilities for when something is triggered (perch=
=20
platform was landed on, coin sensor was triggered, etc.), but I also want=
=20
to be able to have alerting via a web interface/live feed (through a nest=
=20
camera), and to be able to set the mode / restart remotely. "Remember Kids=
=20
the Only Difference Between Screwing Around and Science Is Writing It Down"=
=20
- Adam Savage

I=E2=80=99m also thinking building in some squirrel deterrents, like being =
able to=20
close the lid manually would be useful, and driving a vibrating motor would=
=20
be entertaining, or triggering a loud sound =E2=80=94 via a web interface/a=
pi of=20
course. Purely for fun times there =E2=80=94 haha.

Anyway, let=E2=80=99s talk about what=E2=80=99s in these designs though!

*Learnings:*

I=E2=80=99ve found that using Scigrip #3 is easier and better than #16. It =
requires=20
a syringe needle/bottle, but it=E2=80=99s honestly so much easier and clean=
er --=20
fewer static/string issues, and faster fabrication times. It seems to=20
reduce surface scarring, bonds stronger, isn=E2=80=99t drying on tips all t=
he time,=20
and makes for cleaner looking welds (especially in regards to the=20
transparent parts). Because of this these designs don=E2=80=99t include not=
ches on=20
tabs that slot together, minimizes holes specifically for glue, and instead=
=20
relies on capillary action =E2=80=94 since #3 permeates into the gaps bette=
r.

Check this data sheet=20
<https://www.curbellplastics.com/Research-Solutions/Technical-Resources/Tec=
hnical-Resources/Bonding-Acrylic-with-SCIGRIP-3-4-or-16>=20
for more details. It was also easier to find Scigrip #3 locally, which is=
=20
ultimately how I ended up experimenting and forming this opinion.

*Costs (on Ponoko using 3mm black/transparent acrylic and 0.5mm styrene):*

- Current designs come to ($113.51 + 14.00 - 33.37) an actual checkout=20
price of *$94.12*.
- These designs come to ($97.34 + 14.00 - 13.06) an actual checkout price=
=20
of *$**97.34*.

A difference of +*$3.22. *The difference comes down to an increase in=20
material (primarily from the electronics enclosure), and fewer designs in=
=20
your cart receives less of a discount (?).

*Noteworthy features:*

Modular concepts, where various subassemblies are intended to be capable of=
=20
being swapped out. This comes down to four primary subassembly divisions:

- The housing subassembly - the primary box that everything fits onto/into
- The lid subassembly - the sliding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit=
=20
switches, and coin magazine
- The basket subassembly - the face plate and basket that slots onto the=20
housing subassembly
- The electronics subassembly - weather resistant box for the the Arduino

These subassemblies are separated into their component concepts so they can=
=20
be replaced or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and basket=20
subassemblies aren=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subasse=
mbly.=20
They interlock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pins, and=
=20
can be removed fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue them in=20
place, you absolutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replaced to=
=20
allow smaller/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance, I=
=E2=80=99m going=20
to be replacing colors and swapping between my two box placements=20
periodically to see if different colors (or transparency) perform=20
differently. This aspect of the design removes the need to have any access=
=20
panels.

Other parts of the design have similar interlocking concepts. This is=20
notable in the assembly steps of the basket, as pieces are slotted in from=
=20
the back of the face plate. The basket ribs are then slid into position and=
=20
things are bolted together, which creates a cohesive and stable subassembly=
=20
that can then be glued more easily with minimal effort in holding / getting=
=20
things aligned properly. I may post a couple photos/videos of this on my=20
final build, because the order of operations matters a bit here.

Better weathering potential. Drainage holes have been added to the corners=
=20
of the bottom panel that allow moisture to drain (regardless of level /=20
lean orientation). The electronics subassembly allows better whatever level=
=20
of weatherizing you feel is needed. I personally have only built the box=20
and then rubber banded one of the panels in place, so I can still easily=20
access the electronics, but since the subassembly is designed to keep a gap=
=20
between the inner walls of the housing subassembly it means less water will=
=20
be touching the surfaces that the electronics are mounted to.

The basket volume has increased by some ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do th=
e hard=20
math here, but the basket depth has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm),=
=20
the sliding lid has 1cm more travel, and is a little more than 2cm wider. =
=20
That, and other design tweaks to the basket increase the volume for food,=
=20
and reduce the area that scraps or other material can accidentally fall it=
=20
into the coin delivery areas. This may have an impact on accidental coin=20
activations, but that's something I plan on running an experiment on -- in=
=20
this version I actually just wanted to increase volume and will run some=20
tests on different aspects of this.

The layout and placement of parts is optimized to get everything onto a=20
single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=E2=80=9D x 15.1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color par=
ts, and the=20
transparent parts can be doubled up on a single sheet of the same=20
dimensions. This allows ordering two color sheets and a single (doubled up=
=20
design) transparent sheet. So two crowboxes, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I=
=20
know some laser cutters won=E2=80=99t be able to accommodate that size, but=
 I=20
optimized for what was immediately at hand during the pandemic, and that=20
was the capabilities of Ponoko.

Transparent part usage was reduced in the housing subassembly, which means=
=20
the housing is fully opaque when using an opaque acrylic (no transparent=20
parts come through from the back to the front except for the lid). The=20
logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/light or movement could=20
unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one side of the housing to=
=20
the other.

The bottom panel has some holes for drainage, and also a mirrored=20
=E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D of slots that sensors or subhousings can utiliz=
e in future=20
revisions or iterations. For instance, the coin sensor uses this interface,=
=20
as does the electronics subassembly, and each can be mirrored to use the=20
right or left side depending on build or deployment concerns. A similar=20
concept is available on the bottom of the rails (to hang things from), but=
=20
that=E2=80=99s not being utilized in these designs.

The coin magazine has more capacity, and is designed to allow more=20
flexibility in movement (in that it=E2=80=99s not glued to the lid), which =
makes=20
jamming less likely (potentially even when using non U.S. quarter sized=20
coins). It also now slots into position, so placement doesn't require=20
measuring and gluing. It's held in position between the lid and the perch=
=20
platform using a piece of styrene without needing to glue it in place.

There=E2=80=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs, but=
 you=E2=80=99re=20

<div>Hey! I posted a while back about working through some design changes t=
hat I think will work better for colder/harsher climates. I=E2=80=99ve done=
 that, built a couple tests, and have made some revisions to make sure it=
=E2=80=99s working well and holds up to the project tenets.</div><div><br><=

 as an unofficial =E2=80=9Cv3.1=E2=80=9D design (version 3 since they aren=
=E2=80=99t backwards compatible, and revision 1 because I=E2=80=99ve done a=
n alpha and beta build).</div><div><br></div><div>I=E2=80=99m not expecting=
 any level of official adoption of these designs, but it=E2=80=99s always a=
 nice warm feeling to know that others can benefit from my efforts.</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>I=E2=80=99ve created a <a href=3D"https://github.com/jeja=
cks0n/crowbox">GitHub repo</a> and encourage one of the core members to sen=
d me a GitHub account so I can transfer this repo to you (I=E2=80=99ll rewr=
ite the initial commits to be yours as well). Since it=E2=80=99s a CC/Share=
Alike license, I want to contribute back, but don=E2=80=99t really know how=
 best to. After transferring it, I=E2=80=99ll move my design tweaks to my o=
wn fork, and others can do the same if they=E2=80=99re so inclined -- or if=
 it's not worth doing, I'll make it clear it's not at all official repo. I =
know using something like git is maybe a complexity, but if it=E2=80=99s an=
 open source project, I tend to think people who <i>can</i>&nbsp;contribute=
 will probably understand how to, or would be willing to learn. I also thin=
k it would be a useful place to migrate the wiki to, but understand if that=
=E2=80=99s not part of the goals.</div><div><br></div><div>I=E2=80=99ve rea=
lly tried to make sure this design is as solid as current, with hopefully a=
n improvement here and there -- there's some trade offs for sure. I=E2=80=
=99ve enjoyed hacking on this, so thanks to everyone who=E2=80=99s contribu=
ted thus far. =3D)</div><div><br></div><div>I added the CRoS source to the =
repo as well, because I=E2=80=99m planning to add support for the wifi rev2=
 hardware that I=E2=80=99m using. My goals here are mostly around event tra=
cking capabilities for when something is triggered (perch platform was land=
ed on, coin sensor was triggered, etc.), but I also want to be able to have=
 alerting via a web interface/live feed (through a nest camera), and to be =
able to set the mode / restart remotely. "Remember Kids the Only Difference=
 Between Screwing Around and Science Is Writing It Down" - Adam Savage</div=
><div><br></div><div>I=E2=80=99m also thinking building in some squirrel de=
terrents, like being able to close the lid manually would be useful, and dr=
iving a vibrating motor would be entertaining, or triggering a loud sound =
=E2=80=94 via a web interface/api of course. Purely for fun times there =E2=

 faster fabrication times. It seems to reduce surface scarring, bonds stron=
ger, isn=E2=80=99t drying on tips all the time, and makes for cleaner looki=
ng welds (especially in regards to the transparent parts). Because of this =
these designs don=E2=80=99t include notches on tabs that slot together, min=
imizes holes specifically for glue, and instead relies on capillary action =
=E2=80=94 since #3 permeates into the gaps better.</div><div><br></div><div=

</div><div><br></div><div>Modular concepts, where various subassemblies are=
 intended to be capable of being swapped out. This comes down to four prima=
ry subassembly divisions:</div><div><br></div><div>- The housing subassembl=
y - the primary box that everything fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid suba=
ssembly - the sliding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit switches, and=
 coin magazine</div><div>- The basket subassembly - the face plate and bask=
et that slots onto the housing subassembly</div><div>- The electronics suba=
ssembly - weather resistant box for the the Arduino</div><div><br></div><di=
v>These subassemblies are separated into their component concepts so they c=
an be replaced or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and basket s=
ubassemblies aren=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subassem=
bly. They interlock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pins,=
 and can be removed fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue them i=
n place, you absolutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replaced t=
o allow smaller/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance,=
 I=E2=80=99m going to be replacing colors and swapping between my two box p=
lacements periodically to see if different colors (or transparency) perform=
 differently. This aspect of the design removes the need to have any access=
 panels.</div><div><br></div><div>Other parts of the design have similar in=
terlocking concepts. This is notable in the assembly steps of the basket, a=
s pieces are slotted in from the back of the face plate. The basket ribs ar=
e then slid into position and things are bolted together, which creates a c=
ohesive and stable subassembly that can then be glued more easily with mini=
mal effort in holding / getting things aligned properly. I may post a coupl=
e photos/videos of this on my final build, because the order of operations =
matters a bit here.</div><div><br></div><div>Better weathering potential. D=
rainage holes have been added to the corners of the bottom panel that allow=
 moisture to drain (regardless of level / lean orientation). The electronic=
s subassembly allows better whatever level of weatherizing you feel is need=
ed. I personally have only built the box and then rubber banded one of the =
panels in place, so I can still easily access the electronics, but since th=
e subassembly is designed to keep a gap between the inner walls of the hous=
ing subassembly it means less water will be touching the surfaces that the =
electronics are mounted to.</div><div><br></div><div>The basket volume has =
increased by some ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, but =
the basket depth has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding lid =
has 1cm more travel, and is a little more than 2cm wider.&nbsp; That, and o=
ther design tweaks to the basket increase the volume for food, and reduce t=
he area that scraps or other material can accidentally fall it into the coi=
n delivery areas. This may have an impact on accidental coin activations, b=
ut that's something I plan on running an experiment on -- in this version I=
 actually just wanted to increase volume and will run some tests on differe=
nt aspects of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout and placement of pa=
rts is optimized to get everything onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=E2=
=80=9D x 15.1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color parts, and the transparent parts ca=
n be doubled up on a single sheet of the same dimensions. This allows order=
ing two color sheets and a single (doubled up design) transparent sheet. So=
 two crowboxes, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I know some laser cutters won=
=E2=80=99t be able to accommodate that size, but I optimized for what was i=
mmediately at hand during the pandemic, and that was the capabilities of Po=
noko.</div><div><br></div><div>Transparent part usage was reduced in the ho=
using subassembly, which means the housing is fully opaque when using an op=
aque acrylic (no transparent parts come through from the back to the front =
except for the lid). The logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/light=
 or movement could unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one side=
 of the housing to the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom panel has=
 some holes for drainage, and also a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D o=
f slots that sensors or subhousings can utilize in future revisions or iter=
ations. For instance, the coin sensor uses this interface, as does the elec=
tronics subassembly, and each can be mirrored to use the right or left side=
 depending on build or deployment concerns. A similar concept is available =
on the bottom of the rails (to hang things from), but that=E2=80=99s not be=
ing utilized in these designs.</div><div><br></div><div>The coin magazine h=
as more capacity, and is designed to allow more flexibility in movement (in=
 that it=E2=80=99s not glued to the lid), which makes jamming less likely (=
potentially even when using non U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now slot=
s into position, so placement doesn't require measuring and gluing. It's he=
ld in position between the lid and the perch platform using a piece of styr=
ene without needing to glue it in place.</div><div><br></div><div>There=E2=
=80=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs, but you=E2=
=80=99re welcome to hot glue the subassemblies together since it=E2=80=99s =
fairly trivial to remove and might minimize rattling and other noise. I=E2=
=80=99ve also used <a href=3D"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AS9NAS">shelf l=
iner</a> to reduce noise from dropping coins.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyw=

city of build, simplicity in ordering, cost of build, flexibility in versio=
ning / color options (I want to do this purely so I can test different colo=
rs), flexibility in options (for instance, the housing alternative to the s=
led), etc.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again! It&#39;s been reall=
y enjoyable to work on the crowbox so far, and if I can, I&#39;d be happy t=
o help out in other ways too. I&#39;m a software engineer, and am intereste=
d in discussing the code / hardware as well -- including a raspberry pi imp=
lementation, but that&#39;s an entirely different topic and one I haven&#39=
;t dived into fully yet.</div>
