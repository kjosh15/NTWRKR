Chris,

Really liked your suggestions for the first sequence. Agree with your
deletes but would suggest we could scrap the whole urchin software piece
from "Rewind" at 0:48 to 1:32. Instead, we can move 2:50 to refer to Google
Analytics and then add the slide about building a whole new marketplace. -
that's stronger at the end in any case. Finally, wouldn't put the Google
Analytics + IndigoMetrics logos together unless we're pitching specifically
to Alphabet. :)

Also would add:

2:18 include longitudinal graph showing upward growth
2:23 show building being built, from scaffolding to frame to full building
2:29 showing RL handshake in background doesn't fit with graphics used
throughout rest of video
2:31 need to show large corporations full of employees fading in -
something to demonstrate huge growth of users
2:41 show servers being built, stacked, and filling data centers or
something similar
2:47 should show new feature buttons appearing on a website - or fill out
our dashboard with new buttons

Agreed? Finally, I'd suggest that we send over this
<https://school.mangoanimate.com/5-best-animated-explainer-video-examples-2=
020/>
as
examples of the kind of animations we're looking for. Note there is no text
in any of these videos.
