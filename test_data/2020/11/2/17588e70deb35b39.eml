Great, thanks! How does next week look for you? My co-founder and I are
finally aligned in looking for a strategic acquirer for IndigoMetrics; we
signed another major client last week (33k employees) and so have enough
sales growth (and the market for HR services is hot enough) that we think
it makes sense. Long story, but could really use your insight from the
corporate acquisitions side of things.

Hope you're doing well despite all the recent lockdowns - here's hoping
things will settle enough for some travel by the holidays!!!

All best,
Josh
