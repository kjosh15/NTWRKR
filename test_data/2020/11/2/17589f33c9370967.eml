Jas,

Thanks again for the call earlier today; I really appreciate your
insights!! I wanted to follow up to offer whatever support I could to
facilitate the outreach you'd suggested to Peter Schwartz, Cheryl Contee,
and Anasa Troutman. To that end I've attached our basic overview deck,
noting that nothing quite clarifies the platform like a walk through the
sandbox. :)

I'll continue to think through how the platform could be used to evaluate
internal systems or measure experiences, and look forward to talking to you
and Jed about consulting. I've managed to try a lot of things that really
don't work, and have a few ideas on building platforms and networks, so if
I can be of any help to you both I'm absolutely game!! Let me know when
works well for you.

Gratefully,
Josh
