Hi Josh,

Thanks for reaching out.  Good to see you are working on some cool =
projects for our virtualized world. =20

=20

Wanted to update you on what I have been up to since the quarantine hit. =


=20

Up until March, I had been working with META on a slew of =
experiences/events but like most people in the industry, everything I =
was working on was cancelled or put on an indefinite hold.  As a way to =
stay connected and bring a little levity to a group of friends spread =
across the country, I created a trivia game based around all the things =
we are into.  That one game turned into a weekly game, with more people =
joining each week, which then led to me creating games for different =
groups of people and other friends also looking for a little bit of fun =
and connection.  I began charging people to play at that point, 1/2 of =
which I donate to local charities in NYC, and go full steam with =
developing it out, even building my own custom mobile buzzer system.  =
Since that point, word of mouth has spread organically and I've been =
able to do a lot of games for organizations looking to engage their WFH =
staff and clients in a fun, customized and engaging way, which I feel my =
game does.  This week for example I'm doing 2 games for Yelp and one for =
Snap and have already completed games for Verizon, Instagram, Spotify, =
Plex, RCA Records just to name a few.  I'm also using the games to raise =
money for local NYC charities. =20

=20

Considering that a lot of virtual event offerings are very passive =
one-way communications that do not always keep their audiences focused, =
I feel like my game really builds that interpersonal connection between =
players that everyone is in need of during this time.  I also customize =
games around each group playing, allowing it to be a more personalized =
experience and furthering engagement of participants. =20

=20

Here is a little deck =
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WABf2hSub1kxDmKa6J7tnQxVayhPXkC8=
akSbi1SbNRc/edit?usp=3Dsharing>  I am working on for the game and a one =
sheet attached.  Over the next few months I plan to further build out =
the game play and elements while also working with some partners =
interested in developing similar offerings for their own platforms or =
digital initiatives.  The next phase will be building out the gameboard =
to integrate my branding and create more of a dynamic viewing =
experience, complete with sights and sounds.  I am actually looking for =
partners to work with on this and curious if that would be something you =
would be interested in working on.  I plan to also raise a small sum of =
money from some interested investors to get this all completed. =20

=20

Let me know if interested in getting on a call to learn more or if I can =
send you any additional info on my plans for growth. =20

=20

Thanks in advance and hope all is well with you.
