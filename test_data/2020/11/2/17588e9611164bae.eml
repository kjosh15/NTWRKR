A few weeks ago I sold a product I had created and run with my =
cofounder.

We had been working on it since 2016 and it was profitable (making =
thousands a month and costing less than a thousand a year in expenses). =
Over the years, we had amassed over a thousand customers.

But when the right buyer came along, who offered the right price, we =
decided to sell it. How come?=20

(This is obviously my own point of view, since I don't want to speak for =
my cofounder.)

The main reason I wanted to sell is that there's a huge difference =
between being a starter and being an operator. A starter has the vision =
to create a product or business from nothing, and build it out. The =
skillset here is mostly creativity, vision and assuming at least some =
risk. An operator, on the other hand, has the ability to run an existing =
thing on a daily basis. The skill set required is mostly process =
optimization, support, and steering.

I think I fall more in the starter than operator camp, especially when a =
product requires more on the operation side than starting side. The =
product we sold is a plugin that lives within WordPress. Which is both =
good and bad. Good because lots of folks use WordPress, especially for =
online courses. Bad because WordPress, if not managed well, can become a =
jumbled mess of insanity. And so, while selling our plugin, we quickly =
realized that 90% of support was helping people fix their WordPress =
setup (even though it had nothing to do with our product) and ensuring =
it played nicely with literally thousands of other plugins, all of which =
could be coded with a blatant disregard for conventions.

This isn't a slight to WordPress. I think any ecosystem where =
third-parties create things can end up a jumbled mess. But, because of =
this reality, we were averaging one support ticket/thread for every =
couple sales, which amounts to a ton of time spent on support. Too much =
time for two people. For a little comparison, we average less than one =
support ticket/thread per 15-20 customers for my Fathom Analytics =
<https://usefathom.com/>  product (stand-alone SaaS app), and those =
tickets don't typically require debugging an entire website or group of =
plugins. Actually, more than half our support tickets are either =
business development questions or feature requests (both are easy to =
deal with).

A tiny company (or "company of one" if you'd like) isn't set up to =
handle that scale of support. Support scaled so close to revenue =
increases. Whereas a larger company, like the one we sold the product =
to, has a dedicated support team and has baked into their company =
infrastructure a way to deal with large volumes of support for large =
volumes of sales. They excel at being an operator company. This is why =
we sold to them - obviously we get a payout, but moreso, we only wanted =
to sell to a company who could on day-one take over support and =
eventually make support even better than we could.

All of this is to say, it's been a good lesson for me to think about the =
maintenance cost of success. The product did well in terms of revenue, =
but the cost of that revenue was waking up every day and clearing out a =
support inbox. Yes, we could have hired to solve for this, but then  I'd =
have to manage other people (something I'm not interested in). It =
reminds me of a podcast episode =
<https://ofone.co/how-to-build-a-business-you-accidentally-hate/>  I =
recorded with my friend Margo about "how to build a company you =
accidentally hate". The key point in the episode being: there=E2=80=99s =
a difference between the business you could run and the business you =
should run.

In learning the lesson above, Jack and I have been very intentional with =
how we build Fathom. We constantly consider how any new feature will =
impact support. We ask ourselves daily, do the decisions we make lead us =
to loving or potentially not loving the operational side of the =
business? We want to continue building a business we should run.

I didn't hate the product or customers, but I did grow to feel stressed =
out about the constant deluge of support required to keep it running. =
And not just "oh, I can answer this support question in 10 seconds" but =
"oh, I need full access and an hour or two of mucking about to solve =
this problem". There are people who excel at those sorts of tasks, and I =
now know I'm not one of them.

So while I'll miss working with my cofounder, the awesome customers we =
had, and building out the idea, I won't miss operating the company long =
term. It wasn=E2=80=99t bad work, it was just work I don=E2=80=99t feel =
suited for individually. And I'm so pleased that we found a buyer who's =
more than capable of being an operator and therefore able to keep the =
product going far into the future.

product or business from nothing, and build it out. The skillset here is =
mostly creativity, vision and assuming at least some risk. An operator, =
on the other hand, has the ability to run an existing thing on a daily =
basis. The skill set required is mostly process optimization, support, =

fall more in the starter than operator camp, especially when a product =
requires more on the operation side than starting side. The product we =
sold is a plugin that lives within WordPress. Which is both good and =
bad. Good because lots of folks use WordPress, especially for online =
courses. Bad because WordPress, if not managed well, can become a =
jumbled mess of insanity. And so, while selling our plugin, we quickly =
realized that 90% of support was helping people fix their WordPress =
setup (even though it had nothing to do with our product) and ensuring =
it played nicely with literally thousands of other plugins, all of which =
could be coded with a blatant disregard for =
conventions.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p =

a slight to WordPress. I think any ecosystem where third-parties create =
things can end up a jumbled mess. But, because of this reality, we were =
averaging one support ticket/thread for every couple sales, which =
amounts to a ton of time spent on support. Too much time for two people. =
For a little comparison, we average less than one support ticket/thread =
per 15-20 customers for my <a href=3D"https://usefathom.com/" =
target=3D"_blank">Fathom Analytics</a> product (stand-alone SaaS app), =
and those tickets don't typically require debugging an entire website or =
group of plugins. Actually, more than half our support tickets are =
either business development questions or feature requests (both are easy =
to deal with).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p =

company (or &quot;company of one&quot; if you'd like) isn't set up to =
handle that scale of support. Support scaled so close to revenue =
increases. Whereas a larger company, like the one we sold the product =
to, has a dedicated support team and has baked into their company =
infrastructure a way to deal with large volumes of support for large =
volumes of sales. They excel at being an operator company. This is why =
we sold to them - obviously we get a payout, but moreso, we only wanted =
to sell to a company who could on day-one take over support and =
eventually make support even better than we =
could.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p =

this is to say, it's been a good lesson for me to think about the =

business? We want to continue building a business we should =
