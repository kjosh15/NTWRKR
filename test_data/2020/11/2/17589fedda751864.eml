Hit me! Sounds ideal. Mostly I've been working on this
<http://www.indigometrics.com> company, building a pitch for this
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=3Dsharing>
project, and doing this <http://josh.is> kind of consulting. So, the usual
mixed bag. ;)

Looking forward to that trailer!
