Hi Jay, glad to hear the box came together and things seem to be rolling.

As for adjusting the perch for weight, you can experiment with the
different sets of hooks on the back of the Crowbox to create more or less
tension in the rubber band that is used to tune the activation weight for
the perch. During the prototyping phase I experimented with multiple rubber
bands and also with tying a knot into one rubber band to shorten it in
order to create more tension. Both methods worked well.

I can't remember if I put it in the videos, but if you stack five US
quarters and tape them together with a little strip of masking tape, this
makes a very handy weight that is almost precisely one ounce. Obviously you
can make multiples of these to test different weights and get the behavior
you want.

Josh is the person who developed the idea of the Crowbox. I had some
knowledge of electronics and I had the fabrication tools I'd need to do
rapid iterations on prototypes (mainly, a laser cutter) so I emailed Josh
asking if there was a way to get involved. It was the nature and science
aspects of the experiment that drew me.  Anyway, it just so happens that
when I emailed Josh he was already thinking of ways to solve problems with
the first Crowbox kit, which was quite complicated to build and operate and
gave users a lot of trouble. So we worked together to redesign it for a
simpler assembly (particularly the electronics) and I was able to do a lot
of testing and observation at home because at the time I lived in a place
with lots of Crows and Stellers Jays.

-Steve

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Jay, glad to hear the box came together and things seem=
 to be rolling.<div><br></div><div>As for adjusting the perch for weight, y=
ou can experiment with the different sets of hooks on the back of the Crowb=
ox to create more or less tension in the rubber band that is used to tune t=
he activation weight for the perch. During the prototyping phase I experime=
nted with multiple rubber bands and also with tying a knot into one rubber =
band to shorten it in order to create more tension. Both methods worked wel=
l.</div><div><br></div><div>I can&#39;t remember if I put it in the videos,=
 but if you stack five US quarters and tape them together with a little str=
ip of masking tape, this makes a very handy weight that is almost precisely=
 one ounce. Obviously you can make multiples of these to test different wei=
ghts and get the behavior you want.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Josh is =
the person who developed the idea of the Crowbox. I had some knowledge of e=
lectronics and I had the fabrication tools I&#39;d need to do rapid iterati=
ons on prototypes (mainly, a laser cutter) so I emailed Josh asking if ther=
e was a way to get involved. It was the nature and science aspects of the e=
xperiment that drew me.=C2=A0 Anyway, it just so happens that when I emaile=
d Josh he was already thinking of ways to solve problems with the first Cro=
wbox kit, which was quite complicated to build and operate and gave users a=
 lot of trouble. So we worked together to redesign it for a simpler assembl=
y (particularly the electronics) and I was able to do a lot of testing and =
observation at home because at the time I lived in a place with lots of Cro=
ws and Stellers Jays.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div><=

disable this button and try running your Crowbox again. Just unplug the Cro=

 In your build these wires are blue and green, it doesn&#39;t matter which =

d the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a =
couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are =
of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some =
of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the bo=
ard, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorma=

style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">Second- Did you make any changes at all to the =
CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left=

8in">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power supply issue so we should chec=
k a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, or rule it out and look=
 for another cause. I know of two builds which had power supply issues and =
both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be easi=
ly explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t really be able to dire=
ct the servo to do. At least, not in the order you described.</p></div><div=
><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p=
 class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">First, a fact about servo =
operation: When the servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount=
 of current. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with t=
he power supply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Ardu=
ino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox r=
eboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then ste=
p-close it. This could explain why your lid behaves the way it does.</p></d=

<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">Here are three prob=
lems I&#39;d like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=3D"=
MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"Mso=
Normal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">1) If you are running your electronics =
tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via USB, you still =
need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull about 500=
mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enough to run the boa=
rd and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div><div><p cl=
ass=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=
=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">2) Make sure the power supply yo=
u are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA=
 to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can b=
rown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any ad=
ditional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend=
 a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of available=
 current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">3) =
If you are already using a power supply, and the power supply is rated for =
2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the=
 two power supply-related problems I know of, one person was using a very w=
eak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power su=
pply that was faulty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p=

oject for a while. Josh has been asking me to help troubleshoot your proble=
m and I&#39;m now finally in a position to spend some time working with you=
 to get these problems ironed out.=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorma=

" style=3D"margin-left:225.6pt">Here&#39;s the one part that will be annoyi=
ng for you, because I know you&#39;ve already done this- Josh sends me a lo=
t of support requests and I deal with as many as I can. But this means I do=
n&#39;t know exactly what your situation is. So if you could explain your p=
roblem and/or point me to some existing posts in the Crowbox group so that =
I can catch up and devise a troubleshooting strategy, that would be very he=
lpful. If I recall correctly, you have a problem we haven&#39;t seen before=
 so our off-the-shelf solutions won&#39;t help you.</p></div><div><p class=

phone, or video chat if needed. For now, please email some details on your =
problem.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:225.6pt"=
