Indeed. It's a big part of what I like about the strategic acquisition; if
we could just focus on the analytics and impact side (i.e., service testing

hose tickets don&#39;t typically require debugging an entire website or gro=

pany (or &quot;company of one&quot; if you&#39;d like) isn&#39;t set up to =
handle that scale of support. Support scaled so close to revenue increases.=
 Whereas a larger company, like the one we sold the product to, has a dedic=
ated support team and has baked into their company infrastructure a way to =
deal with large volumes of support for large volumes of sales. They excel a=
t being an operator company. This is why we sold to them - obviously we get=
 a payout, but moreso, we only wanted to sell to a company who could on day=
