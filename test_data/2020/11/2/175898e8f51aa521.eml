Mike,

Really excited for the upcoming Summit - you've got a great lineup, and I'm 
really curious to see how the group responds to doing it virtually at this 
point in the pandemic!

I was going to reach out to some of my stronger contacts in the group to 
set a "catch up call" around the time of the summit. This made me realize 
that what I'll miss most is the unexpected chats that happen throughout. 

To that end, what do you think about my reaching out to a larger subset of 
I50 (i.e., the folks I've heard expressing interest in new things on past 
calls) about having a short, casual "coffee catch up" around the time of 
the summit? I'm suggesting a 30m chat about the most interesting challenges 
of the last seven months and to share whatever resources or insights we 
might have to help each other. 

I wanted to clear this all with you before sending out messages on the W50 
app, but I'm excited about the possibility. It's been a hell of a year, and 
this community more than most is swimming in the brave new reality of new 
tech and opportunity. Now is the time to deepen those connections. Let me 
know!

All best,
Josh
