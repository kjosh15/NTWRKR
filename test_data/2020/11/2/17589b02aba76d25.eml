Wanted to followup to see if there was reason to reconnect. I'm curious to =
hear what you're up to and to see if we can't innovate on something world =
changing together!!

All best,
Josh

Below are a few of my current projects; let me know if any strike =
your interest, or just hit me with an update on what you're working on. Or =
let's set up a time to chat!

All best wishes,

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in =
employees. Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

; a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce =
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid=
!)

: as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on =
technology transformation and new innovation / product development.
