Mike,

I was about to reach out to some of our friends in the I50 group about
setting up brief chats to reconnect around the time of the summit, and
realized I missed the serendipitous connections the most. I figured I'd ask
you first; what do you think about offering to connect to some of the newer
members just to compare notes on the big new innovations they're seeing
this far into the pandemic? I thought it could add to the community feel
and help open up the group conversation.

Hope you're thriving out there in this crazy new world!
- Josh
