Hi Josh (& Hulda),

=20

So sorry to have taken so long to respond =E2=80=93 not like I=E2=80=99m =
uber busy at the moment lol!!!

=20

I wondered if you were still in Iceland as, when I spoke to your dad to =
say that my US flight/trip had been cancelled back in August, he said =
you were there for the foreseeable future=E2=80=A6  Will it be your =
forever home now, or just during this absolutely Crap time??!!

=20

I=E2=80=99ve been volunteering at the local Hospice Shop for two days a =
week, rather than just one afternoon, since I was allowed to go back =
there in August (too old to go back in June, as I=E2=80=99m over 70 and =
it was against government advice, hence the shop had no insurance cover =
for us =E2=80=98old fossils=E2=80=99!!!!)..=20

=20

It=E2=80=99s been my solace, being on my own =E2=80=93 and now =
we=E2=80=99re going back into complete lockdown again, from this coming =
Thursday supposedly for just a month, but everyone thinks it=E2=80=99ll =
be a lot longer, perhaps even next year.

=20

My best and closest friend, Carla, who lives two mins walk away, went, =
in August, to join her partner Chris, who lives in Guernsey (one of the =
channel islands) and is a high class jeweller.  I don=E2=80=99t know =
when she=E2=80=99ll be back, certainly not until well into next year; =
the island has no lockdown, masks or social distancing, as =
they=E2=80=99ve been able to keep the virus at bay..  Normally Chris =
comes over a few times a year, especially Christmas, and Carla goes to =
stay each summer =E2=80=93 May to September.

=20

This hasn=E2=80=99t bothered me before, because (since losing Bernie =
=E2=80=93 10 years in February!) my way to keep from feeling sorry for =
my loss has been by being ultra-busy with work, Harley club meets and =
Rallies, other clubs and events, US and other trips and, of =
course=E2=80=A6 as many rock concerts as I can fit in lol!!  Was really =
looking forward to Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd and others, this =
year=E2=80=A6

=20

With no family, I=E2=80=99m going to find this coming lockdown =
especially hard living alone, as I won=E2=80=99t even see my neighbours =
in the garden, it being much colder with winter approaching..  =
They=E2=80=99re a lovely young couple, and we got to know each other =
really well this summer; they=E2=80=99re coming with me next April =
(fingers crossed) to see Bryan Adams at the Royal Albert Hall=E2=80=A6.

=20

Well, that=E2=80=99s me up to speed =E2=80=93 have done pretty much =
Nothing since March (when I was supposed to go to Italy; then France in =
May).  I should have just landed back in the UK TODAY(!) after driving =
11,000 miles in 68 days=E2=80=A6  I just hope I=E2=80=99m up to doing =
this trip when we=E2=80=99re eventually (fingers crossed!!) through this =
horrendous period..

=20

Well, have wittered on long enough =E2=80=93 you probably stopped =
reading after the first two paragraphs lol!!

=20

Hope everything is well with you, Hulda, the boys and your extended =
family.

=20

Much love, Eve xxx

=20

PS =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99m on Facebook (Eve Hilditch) if you want to FB =
video chat, or WhatsApp=E2=80=A6  I=E2=80=99m afraid I don=E2=80=99t =
have an iPhone to Facetime.

Just following up: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, and to =
see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the =
view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call =
