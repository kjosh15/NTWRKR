Amen! Yes, next week will be telling. In many ways.

I'll call bullshit on the "old storyteller" line. The internet sees all!

Things are good. Based in Iceland, getting to know the TV/Film community
here in case that is of use to you. Looking ahead to post-pandemic (WTF
that means) and thinking there's going to be a real need for stepchange
advances in "old storytelling." Curious to hear where/what/how you think
the medium could do to leapfrog ahead. Any ideas?
