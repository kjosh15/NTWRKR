Thanks again for the intro - by the time we hung up she had a laundry list
of potential connections. My business partner is now fully on board with
the idea of finding a strategic investor/acquirer, so be ready for me to
hit you up for your take on our pitch deck before too long. ;)

Thanks again, and I hope you and yours are doing well!!
- Josh
