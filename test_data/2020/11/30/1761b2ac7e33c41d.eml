Hi Josh!
well, thanks for reaching out. I am still working to find publishers for
several children's projects. Crow Ride, the story which mentions your work,
doesn't feel like a 'break-through' book to me (although it did get onto a
children's writing contest shortlist in Canada, did I tell you that?) I
still think it would make a great book for classrooms and school libraries,
in particular, and I'm hopeful that some of my more commercial stuff will
pave the way. Right now I'm working on the finishing touches of a fun
home-made serial comic/radio play, trying to get it all tickety boo in time
for the holidays. You can check out the comic and radio play trailer here
<http://www.hildefesterling.com/merch.htm>; that project is really fun and
PURE fake science (I guess that's called science fiction? I think there's a
historical debate going back to Julves Verne VS HP Lovecraft on whether or
not a science fiction author has to groundtheir fictional scientific
marvels in  some kind of scientific reality; the comic does not! Not sure
how we can collaborate but I appreciate you reaching out. Let me know if
anything jumps to mind.
Hilde
