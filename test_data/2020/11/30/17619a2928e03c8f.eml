IndigoMetrics.com is experiencing growth such that M&A is suddenly on our
horizon, but I'm out of touch with the current environment. I don't want to
pitch Andrey for free consulting. However, if you think he'd enjoy a
conversation and would get something out of it I'd be very happy to
connect. My suspicion is I can best provide insight into trending
technology adoption areas and growth markets, as well as potentially some
views on domain-specific areas like FinTech, ITSec, and/or HR and
HealthTech.

Really appreciate the word of warning about "casual chats"!!

All best,
Josh
