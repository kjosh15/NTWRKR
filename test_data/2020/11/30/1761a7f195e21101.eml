Good to connect again, as always. Let me know what your notes are and we'll
revert soonest. Same on timing about what to send when; I'll look to get
estimates ASAP.

Otherwise what I heard was that you'd like to plan to stay through January;
we'll pay the rent + utilities for January, you'll reimburse us in full,
and we can file our 30 day notice Jan 1 with you taking over thereafter.
Let me know if that's not correct.

Onward!
Josh

P.S. I couldn't find the router password in my notes, which means it's
attached to the address. If you can figure out where it is I can look
further into it - regardless, you shouldn't be having dropped connections!
One thing you can try is unplugging the whole array - there's an extension
cord that reaches to under the bookshelves on the lefthand side. Unplug
that, count to thirty, and plug it back in and see if the signal improves.
Let us know if that helps!
