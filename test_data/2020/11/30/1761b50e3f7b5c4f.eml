Dear Bernhard,

I hope all's well, and that your final few weeks at Korn Ferry (and the =
transition to your new role!) are going smoothly.

I wanted to introduce you to Josh Klein =E2=80=93 https://www.josh.is/ =
<https://www.josh.is/> =E2=80=93 who is doing some pioneering work on =
Workplace Culture Analytics through his company =
https://indigometrics.com/ <https://indigometrics.com/>. It=E2=80=99s a =
fascinating tool, and I feel it might have the potential to play a key =
role in your next chapter=E2=80=A6

Josh,

Bernhard Raschke is (at least for a couple more weeks!) a senior client =
partner at Korn Ferry, but will shortly become Chief Transformation =
Officer for https://www.electrocomponents.com/ =
<https://www.electrocomponents.com/>=20

There=E2=80=99s more on Bernhard here =E2=80=93 =
https://www.procurementpowerlist.com/panel/bernhard-raschke/ =
<https://www.procurementpowerlist.com/panel/bernhard-raschke/> =E2=80=93 =
and while he has massive specialist knowledge in the supply =
chain/procurement sector, he and I have been geeking out for a while now =
about the broader challenges of positively affecting organisational =
leadership, teams and culture, and indeed on managing individual =
physical, mental and emotional energy and health in this peculiar =
chapter of the 21st Century...

I hope you might find time for an exploratory chat in the near future as =
I think there are a few areas of mutual interest and potential benefit.

V best,
Ben=20=
