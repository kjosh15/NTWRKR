I'm just thinking in terms of managing our product; we have a nice library
of values already - if we can just reorganize them into sets that address
different goals (the way you're working on D&I atm) it might be a quick
means to offer solutions to needs potential customers have as well as to
address changing market conditions. It's also a nice offer to our resellers
- "here's ESG, D&I, and Innovation sets of values you can sell to your
customers."

I *love* the dating ad format you came up with, however. Remind me to ask
where you got to be such a good pen at those...
