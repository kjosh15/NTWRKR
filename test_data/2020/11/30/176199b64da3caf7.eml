Thanks so much!! My wife is still working through the human
movement/wellness project but we'll revert something to you as soon as
possible. In terms of Indigo, I've attached the latest overview deck and
would say this about the project:

IndigoMetrics is like the Google Analytics of workplace culture; we provide
bias-adjusted statistical models of employee behavior and beliefs so you
can improve alignment and engagement, autonomously and at scale. We're very
curious how IKEA would use such a tool to more deeply align their diverse,
purpose-driven employee base.

Let me know if that misses the mark before you send it out and I'll happily
revert any suggested changes. Really appreciate it!!

Much obliged,
Josh

                                  We started&nbsp;including qualitative dat=
a at our client's behest and then discovered that we can&nbsp;create much m=
ore powerful feedback loops to change behavior by pairing it with our stati=
stical models. For example, this lets us take someone with low scores in a =
certain behavior and solicit anonymous feedback from someone who knows them=
 well and scores highly in that same behavior. The resulting social proof p=
rompts the recipient to take action, and the relationship assures that the =
feedback is actionable, pointed, and relevant.&nbsp;
