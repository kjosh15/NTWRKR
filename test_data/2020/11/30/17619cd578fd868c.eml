Chris,

Here's my notes from the call w/ Chung's business partner who has sold
three companies. TL;DR: I need help answering:

1. provide evidence of effectiveness without exposing methodology
2. how big is our addressable market?
3. what is your growth path?

The last bit, to me, appears to be a continuation of our existing strategy
of white label and organic growth unless we make a strategic partnership,
yes?

All best,
Josh


#######


VC:
3-6 months minimum to get VC funding
big immediate questions will be:
how big is addressable market?
what is your growth path?
will be very industry specific
should know within meeting 5 different VCs if we're likely to get a deal

M&A:
be up front about explaining why they can't do it themselves
Google doesn't just take your idea as much, M$ does it a lot
you can't do M&A without exposing a lot of stuff!
put off the details until you get a terms sheet
provide evidence of effectiveness without exposing methodology
might want to consider getting someone on retainer who knows how to do it
especially if you're looking at M&A folks inside an org
this shit is tricky!! and people will take advantage of you.
it's annoying to give a consultant who will take 3% of the deal to do it,
but can be super helpful
> ping Chung to ask who they used and why
what is my / Chris' value to the acquirer long term, esp. if they already
have a solid sales pipeline

Technical risk:
need to hire someone killer fast
could be young and hungry - has its own risks
> start recruiting for this STAT
would be in a much better position for M&A or anything else
this process is slow, laborious, relies on your network - fishing expeditio=
n
