Josh!

Huge apologies. My mother-in-law had a cancer diagnosis earlier this =
month, so the inbox has been somewhat neglected=E2=80=A6

I=E2=80=99ll connect you with Jack K and with Bernhard Raschke (ex-Korn =
Ferry) via email now. I haven=E2=80=99t spoken to Sami in years so will =
think about the best approach there.

I=E2=80=99ll come back to you re filming my forthcoming project with =
students in Antarctica =E2=80=93 there=E2=80=99s a chance it=E2=80=99ll =
be in the 2022-23 season now as I have one major partner interested in =
funding the whole shebang, but they may need a little more lead time.

On a different note, I=E2=80=99ve been asked to lead a 20-day voyage to =
the Antarctic Peninsula with Insider Expeditions =
<https://insiderexpeditions.com/> from 26th November to 15th December =
next year, on one of the most structurally and technologically advanced =
class of polar ship to date, and one of the most environmentally =
friendly vessels ever to visit Antarctic waters. The objective is to see =
the solar eclipse (the next time it will be visible from Antarctica will =
be in 2039!) but also to bring a likeminded group of global citizens =
together for a unique journey that will be as much about connection, =
conversation, inspiration and co-creating a meaningful legacy as it will =
be about witnessing a v rare natural phenomenon in the most stunning =
natural environment on the planet.

The group will be relatively small (50 max) and we=E2=80=99re partnering =
with the non-profit Students on Ice =E2=80=93 https://studentsonice.com/ =
<https://studentsonice.com/> =E2=80=93 both to further their =
extraordinary work, and to enable eight of their young beneficiaries to =
join the expedition.

Given the collective ambition for this journey, I wondered if there =
could be scope to talk to World 50 about offering their members the =
opportunity to join. I don=E2=80=99t know the organisation at all, but =
I=E2=80=99d love to hear if you think it might be worth exploring...

V best,
Ben=20

the media landscape today.</li><li class=3D"">Alan Gershenfeld - Head of =
<a href=3D"http://elinemedia.com/" target=3D"_blank" =

talking to. Plus, he built a game about the arctic and is deeply focused =
on environmental issues. If nothing else I suspect you'd enjoy each =
other!</li></ul><br class=3D"">Separately, I'd love an intro to your =
