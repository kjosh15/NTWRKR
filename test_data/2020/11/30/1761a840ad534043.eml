Helga,

Thank you so much for the conversation!! I really appreciate you helping me
get up to speed both with the local VC ecosystem in Iceland as well as your
portfolio specifically. It seems like there's lots of overlap and I'm
excited to see how/if I could contribute.

I've attached my CV, Board CV, and Presskit - but the most succinct
information is available at www.josh.is. I'd be keen to follow up with the
teams at Lucinity and Monerium about advising/consulting, and to learn more
about where you'd like to take Travelaid.

I'd also be very happy to talk further if you think I could be of help
directly to Crowberry. For example, I'd love to connect you with my friend
Suzanne Biegel
https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzannebiegel/?originalSubdomain=3Duk who has
done lots of work around women-led investing.

Finally, keep me posted about doing a day in the north of Iceland - I'd
love to have an excuse to connect and network locally!

All best wishes,
Josh
