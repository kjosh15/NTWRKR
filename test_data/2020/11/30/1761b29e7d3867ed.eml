Jack!

How are you?! I can=E2=80=99t believe I was jetting in and out of =
Antarctica this time 12 months ago, and now I=E2=80=99m locked down in =
Gloucestershire. What a year!

I wanted to introduce you to the brilliant Josh Klein. He has one of =
those multi-pronged careers that is difficult to nail in a single job =
title (he=E2=80=99s chosen =E2=80=98hacker=E2=80=99 https://www.josh.is/ =
<https://www.josh.is/> ) and he=E2=80=99s working on a project to =
explore the scope embedded sensors (specifically blood glucose monitors) =
have to positively change behaviour in non-diabetics in order to reduce =
lifestyle disease mortality rates.

Tamsin Lewis slapped a FreeStyle Libre on my shoulder back in 2018 so =
I=E2=80=99ve had a glimpse of the data these sorts of devices can =
produce, and it=E2=80=99s an initiative a) I=E2=80=99m keen to support =
and b) that I suspect could benefit enormously from your wisdom and =
input. Josh is currently based in Iceland, which I=E2=80=99m deeply =
envious about.

Josh,

Dr. Jack Kreindler is a founder of https://www.chhp.com/ =
<https://www.chhp.com/> and in his own words 'a medical technology =
entrepreneur in the areas of wireless biosensors and artificial =
intelligence [who] also lectures internationally on health risk =
management, performance optimisation and the future of medicine=E2=80=99. =
A Brit like me, although we met in South Africa before he flew to =
Antarctica, and I=E2=80=99m not entirely sure where he is now!

I hope you both might have time to talk. I=E2=80=99d love to join too, =
and while I fear most of the medical chat might be above this =
sledge-dragger=E2=80=99s pay grade, it would be a joy to connect you =
both over e.g. Zoom=E2=80=A6

With best wishes,
Ben=20=
