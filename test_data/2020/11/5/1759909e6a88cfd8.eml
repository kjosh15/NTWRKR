ALWAYS happy to connect with you, Dawn. I'm not advising yet, but might get
a role if it looks like it's a real thing. Want to pick a time here
<http://josh.is/scheduling>, or suggest a time that would work for you GMT?

Might also have a wee question for you about raising - IndigoMetrics just
signed our second large multinational. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
