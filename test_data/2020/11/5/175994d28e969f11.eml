I'm not as worried about giving it away - either our 3 years of industry
experience are a moat or they aren't. We're not remotely near an IP moat in
terms of code.

In terms of processed or raw data, I think we should try to figure out what
the "buckets" of data that we can easily surface include and look to see
how much of that is new to what we provide processed already. If there are
only a couple new key metrics, we can take a stab at adding them. If there
is no new overlap we can do some early testing (with folks like David
Wilson's HR person.)

The big thing I'd like to see is a long list of key new metrics we can
experiment with providing, with our existing metrics as a strong leading
baseline. That gives us plenty of room for growth behind our Google
Analytics hypothesis (in terms of features to develop and test) and maybe a
couple things to push up quickly in the meantime to strengthen our data
approach.

No?
