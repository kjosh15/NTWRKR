Thank you so so much!! As ever, had an incredible time. So many insights!!
Was also fun to see more backchannel chat going on with individual members;
it seems like the ecosystem is settling into virtualized discussion more
and more.

I did have a request; Trevor Noah mentioned he's working with Microsoft.
I've been working on a project using their GPT-3 tech that I think he'd
really like; can you connect us? Normally I'd sidle up after the speech and
have a word, but nowadays an introduction is needed!

Thanks again,
Josh
