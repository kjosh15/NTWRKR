I spoke with my contact, Craig Moss, at Ethosphere today; we're going to
set up a call with their tech and culture lead to see if/how they can use
our platform to substantiate their culture work (they basically have a
framework and survey questions, but nothing longitudinal).

Separately, Craig is on the board of cyberreadinessinstitute.org and
thought it might be really interesting to see about doing a distributed
test for one of their founding companies, like GE. He's thinking
specifically about asking cyber readiness questions of distributed groups
like their dealers (i.e., ten people, but a hundred such groups) all
rolling up into GE. Could be a great way to get some bigger US names on the
docket.

Thoughts?
