Trevor,

Thanks so much for speaking to us at the World 50 Innovation 50 group =
earlier today! You mentioned you're working with Microsoft and that it =
was like being Charlie at the Chocolate Factory. The timing was striking =
as I've been building a TV show around Microsoft's new artificial =
intelligence tech, called GPT-3.

It=E2=80=99s a program that uses artificial intelligence to persuade =
Americans to see the other side of divisive issues.

Earlier today you said "comedians place you in a world where things =
aren't completely real so you can deal with what is real" and that "the =
show is a conversation going on with the audience." That's what the =
attached is all about. Let me know if it fits your interest!

All best,
Josh Klein
