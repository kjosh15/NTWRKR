Trevor is talking now, lots of good stuff. I'll ask the organizers for
contact info as soon as we're done and will pass you all my notes. We can
turn around and use the best quotes as part of our request - let me know
what you see / think fits best!

Don't expect I'll get the contact info immediately, but will pass over a
draft just in case for you to review/respond to.

Ready steady go!
