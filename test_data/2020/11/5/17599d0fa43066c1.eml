Here's a draft of what I'd like to send unless you can think of something
better. rrusch@caa.com is his agent. I'll ping them if I don't get anyone
better.

Trevor,

Thanks so much for speaking to us at the World 50 Innovation 50 group
earlier today! You mentioned you're working with Microsoft and that it was
like being Charlie at the Chocolate Factory. The timing was striking as
I've been building a TV show based on their GPT-3 technology - a show in
which an AI independently talks with people about today's most divisive
issues... and attempts to change their mind.

Earlier today you said "comedians place you in a world where things aren't
completely real so you can deal with what is real" and that "the show is a
conversation going on with the audience." That's what the attached is all
about. Let me know if it fits your interest!

All best,
Josh Klein
