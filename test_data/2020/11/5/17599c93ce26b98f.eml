how to use funny to tell people the story
the difficult thing is finding moments of levity
"our giggle at the funeral" - there's got to be a moment when you say, "Oh
yeah, we're still celebrating life"
How do you keep the perspective of the show intact despite what is
happening?
He's not noticing the absence of the audience, he's just making a show.
He's surrounded by good people
the funniest human beings he's ever met in his life
The show is a conversation going on with the audience
as a comedian his eye is trained to see patterns - the inconsistencies make
you laugh
he said that "comedy =3D=3D tragedy + time"
Comedians place you in a world where things aren't completely real so you
can deal with what is real
People don't know what to laugh at because they don't know what's real
the thing I wish more americans would understand is that the two party
system lends itself to a situation where the american public will always be
at loggerheads
Americans aren't very good at being in a space where they're being honest
with themselves or the world
they prefer to be in a space of appeasement
unfortunately it may create peace in the short term - but doesn't create
understanding or conflict resolution in the long term
He tries to have the more uncomfortable conversations
this is the craziest time in human history
everyone is experiencing the same thing at the same time
He loves technology and has loved it his whole life
Pentium 386 - he thought it was a tv. it changed his life.
"The man who gave it to me said it was the future."
"What does that mean?"
"I don't know, but you're going to be the future so figure it out."
Since then he's been addicted.
He used to build computers in high school
used to pirate CDs
Got teamed up with Microsoft
close w/ Brad Smith
(GPT-3 is exclusively licensed by Microsoft)
Was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
3-4 years of working on hardware and products together
his foundation: He's trying to figure out what the school needs and goes
from there
