1. Corporate web site video: think we need to overhaul this in light of =
the Google Analytics approach. For example, we could just life directly =
from the new about page:

"What gets measured gets managed" has been the driving principle for =
business for decades, and yet most organizations have almost no =
measurable insight into their highest value asset - their culture.
=20
Then COVID-19 happened, and the value of workplace culture suddenly =
became paramount. No other element drives such sweeping, massive impact =
across organizations - or represents such significant risk.
=20
Much as Google Analytics prompted the digital marketing revolution by =
unlocking insights that could drive business initiatives at new scale =
and speed, IndigoMetrics is creating the new world of Workplace Culture =
Analytics.
=20
Longitudinal data company-wide lets you steer your company in real-time, =
avoiding risk and launching, measuring, and optimizing campaigns to =
improve alignment, realize D&I, and provide upskilling support where, =
when, and however it works best.=20

And that's just the beginning. IndigoMetrics lets your employees =
evaluate the peers they work with most closely, aggregating valuable =
feedback to help everyone know where they're doing their best work, and =
where they need to improve. Then it rolls that up into the metrics you =
need most to steer your company culture towards improvement, no matter =
what the market conditions.

- So How does it work?
- the platform uses an algorithmically driven peer to peer review =
process to ask your employees to give each other feedback on the =
specific actions, behaviours and values that are important to your =
organisation =20
- Every week each employee answers 6 questions about 5 of their peers, =
on average the whole process takes less than 3 minutes
- the questions and reviewees iterate algorithmically over time to allow =
us to build up a multi-dimensional quantified assessment of each =
individual=E2=80=99s behaviours in a time efficient manner=20
- importantly the behaviours measured are specific to your organisation =
and can be dynamically changed as your internal goals or your external =
environment changes=20
 and our process is specifically designed to address the bias commonly =
associated with peer review systems
- Employees receive continuous, consistent feedback around the quality =
of their behaviours and soft skills=20
- Managers receive a team driven assessment of each of their =
member=E2=80=99s soft skills, putting them in a position to help each =
team member develop within a framework set by your organisation=20
- Leaders receive consistent, timely data quantifying the quality of =
relevant soft skills across their entire organisation =E2=80=93 helping =
them make cultural decisions informed by data and metrics=20
IndigoMetrics can help you and your organisation in many ways =E2=80=93 =
for more information please keep an eye out for the other videos on our =
website that deal with specific use cases:
  -      Data that tilts the world in favour of Diversity and Inclusion
  -      Culture Management and Training effectiveness
 -        Pulse 360, build trust in your organisation
Digital culture management, the future of work
IndigoMetrics - the language of your company, by your company.

2. D+I Focus video: this makes me really twitchy. Seems like there is a =
TON of room for error here. Are you ok if I give a shot at rewriting =
this with more of a "we empower your D&I efforts" than "we solve for =
this by focusing on soft skills" angle?

3. Culture change and training effectiveness: Love this, but think it's =
missing:
- Provides data/insight all the way from specific individual action =
statements to corporate trend lines.
- Has feedback loops baked in to improve alignment automatically and at =
scale
- Can effortlessly incorporate any existing surveying efforts
- Automatically multivariate tests your culture campaigns, L&D, and =
internal comms to give you feedback on what works where with who (WHAT =
KIND OF REPORTS DO WE PROVIDE TO THIS END?)

4. Pulse 360, bringing feedback and review data to the future of work: I =
think that if we have to explain why 360 reviews suck we're not talking =
to the right people.

5. Managing corporate culture in a world of autonomous work: Yes, BUT =
would say distributed not autonomous work. Autonomous employees are =
scary. Distributed workforces are the future. Agree with the generally =
talented point but think that we also need to focus on conduct risk, =
talent churn / retention, and hiring (attracting top talent) as big =
issues here.

6. New participant video: Love this except for the last paragraph, which =
sounds apologetic, and also think that it could benefit from a team =
approach - i.e., this is info about you from the people you work with, =
and vice versa, to create a framework within which you can all address =
the soft skill areas that make you the best team you can be. We all want =
to know how we can improve, but random criticism isn't helpful, and =
anonymous ranting is just that. Indigometrics provides an alternative; =
clear, incisive you alone can use to chart your own career improvement =
as you go, informed by the people who know you best!

OVERALL: This is great stuff!! That said, I wouldn't explain how it =
works in each video, because we explain it on our homepage, we provide =
access to our sandbox to try it, and we'll walk anyone through it in =
person when they're qualified as leads.=20

best,
Josh

P.S. I love that there's a category for "spare Josh text." I have become =
a literal word machine.=20

Talked Harry into doing one more redesign to make it less PPT-y. He'll =
revert EOD tomorrow and hand over all three versions as exports; I'll =
take those and replace what we have now, and going forward we can =
multivariate test the messaging on it when/if we think appropriate.=20

Training effectiveness<br>&nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pulse 360, =
build trust in your organisation<br>Digital culture management, the =
future of work<br>IndigoMetrics - the language of your company, by your =
company.<br><br>2. D+I Focus video: this makes me really twitchy. Seems =
like there is a TON of room for error here. Are you ok if I give a shot =
at rewriting this with more of a &quot;we empower your D&amp;I =
efforts&quot; than &quot;we solve for this by focusing on soft =
skills&quot; angle?<br><br>3. Culture change and training effectiveness: =
Love this, but think it's missing:<br>- Provides data/insight all the =
way from specific individual action statements to corporate trend =
lines.<br>- Has feedback loops baked in to improve alignment =
automatically and at scale<br>- Can effortlessly incorporate any =
existing surveying efforts<br>- Automatically multivariate tests your =
culture campaigns, L&amp;D, and internal comms to give you feedback on =
what works where with who (WHAT KIND OF REPORTS DO WE PROVIDE TO THIS =
END?)<br><br>4. Pulse 360, bringing feedback and review data to the =
future of work: I think that if we have to explain why 360 reviews suck =
we're not talking to the right people.<br><br>5. Managing corporate =
culture in a world of autonomous work: Yes, BUT would say distributed =
not autonomous work. Autonomous employees are scary. Distributed =
workforces are the future. Agree with the generally talented point but =
think that we also need to focus on conduct risk, talent churn / =
retention, and hiring (attracting top talent) as big issues =
here.<br><br>6. New participant video: Love this except for the last =
paragraph, which sounds apologetic, and also think that it could benefit =
from a team approach - i.e., this is info about you from the people you =
work with, and vice versa, to create a framework within which you can =
all address the soft skill areas that make you the best team you can be. =
We all want to know how we can improve, but random criticism isn't =
helpful, and anonymous ranting is just that. Indigometrics provides an =
alternative; clear, incisive you alone can use to chart your own career =
improvement as you go, informed by the people who know you =
best!<br><br>OVERALL: This is great stuff!! That said, I wouldn't =
explain how it works in each video, because we explain it on our =
homepage, we provide access to our sandbox to try it, and we'll walk =
anyone through it in person when they're qualified as leads. =
<br><br>best,<br>Josh<br><br>P.S. I love that there's a category for =
&quot;spare Josh text.&quot; I have become a literal word machine. =
