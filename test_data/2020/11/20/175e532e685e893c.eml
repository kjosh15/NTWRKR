Chris,

*TL;DR:* *Do we retain the value of the data when/if we step away from the
strategic partner?*

Had a good talk with a friend who has advised on M&A before, which was very
helpful in articulating the strategic pitch. I'm going to have a followup
conversation this weekend, but the gist of it was that if we're not married
to the incoming data set to continue improving, then CVC makes great sense
as it pushes us ahead 3-5 years into the advanced world-changing feature
development we're ultimately aimed it, while keeping us open to acquisition
or ongoing growth once we get there.

The main points are:

1. The reason to take CVC + JV is that it gives us immediate access to a
large customer base, much more rapid access to large data sets, and a
concomitant acceleration of the really world-changing features of the
product.

2. This is only rational if this expands our market, regardless of who
eventually buys us. I.e., are the advantages of the larger data sets baked
in, or do we need continual access to same data sets to retain the market
lead? What metadata do we keep regardless of the client's data?

3. If the above is true, we've already proven the model with our
whitelabeled approach. Partnering with a really big incumbent makes sense
as the access to data and clients outstrips what we've been able to produce
with smaller partners like Lane 4, meaning that we already know how to
integrate - which gets us moving even faster.

This approach is all about "we're on the verge of changing the HR world!!"
From that position a strategic CVC makes good sense because it gets us
there faster. It ALSO means that we're not looking for M&A - or, put
another way, M&A would have to come at a really, really good price to
guarantee us access to the world changing we want to do.

Make sense? I'm still working through your docs but feeling much more
confident now that we're getting our stories and targets straight. Let me
know if the above aligns.
