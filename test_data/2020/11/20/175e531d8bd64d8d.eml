I worry about diluting his existing enthusiasm for incorporating his
psychologist friend's content into a BSS-branded "solution." Do you think

but might prove out the video angle.

If nothing else we can suggest it to Michael as something the platform is
capable of and to which they can integrate their custom solution, no?
