Yes except for the majority stake bit - happy to give them right of first
refusal on the next raise, but I think holding on to the idea that we're
aiming to change the world - and expect to see a 100x return as a result -
puts us in a better bargaining position. From a strategic point of view,
we're giving them the first ticket onto our rocket ship ride, which will
advance their service offering and give them pole position into a new
market. They can keep using our tool when we get there, or maybe we'll buy
THEM when the entire world is using us to manage their democracies, etc.
