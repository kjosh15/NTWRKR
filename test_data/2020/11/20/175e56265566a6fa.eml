*TL;DR: I'm spearheading IndigoMetric's approach to Strategic CVC/JV (with
potential for M&A) and could use some counsel. Let me know if you have time
for a conversation in the next week or two!!*
It looks like the world is starting to heat up again, what with two highly
effective vaccine candidates and a new US president who doesn't appear to
be a fascist. Here's where I'm at with my three main targets:

1. Contracting: I've got a couple conversations going with
design/consulting firms, have been tapped to co-host a NYTimes/Accenture
Podcast, and Takeda has renewed discussions. I'm hoping to secure a
one-day-a-week advisory position to cover operating costs beginning in
January.

That said, I'm not clear on what pricing should look like - Takeda is based
in the US, I'm in Iceland, and everyone is remote; *if you have insight
into senior-level consulting / advisory rates these days I'd love to hear
it!*

2. IndigoMetrics: We're looking for $3mm on a $22mm valuation, firstly from
strategic CVC/JV (where we can leverage their existing market/platform and
sales teams to more rapidly explode our data hedge), and otherwise from VC.
We're close to finalizing our approach and I hope to have our deck + docs
done by next week. *Let me know if you're available to review
IndigoMetric's positioning*!

3. CGM Project: I've officially parked this until Q2 2021, because of the
above.

I hope that, wherever you are, you and yours are well and healthy. These
are crazy, heady times. Let's harness the change!

All best wishes,
Josh

P.S. *BONUS*: My media outreach protocol ("*How to automate meaningful
networking in a virtualized world*") is reaping great dividends, and I've
been approached about making it a SaaS platform. I like SaaS b/c it's cheap
to test, run, and scale and if it gets traction it's very simple to hire a
growth manager. If you're interested or know investors who might want to
talk regarding, I have an operator and developer available (I can
advise/guide this in exchange for a piece of the funding as an alternative
to contracting, above.)
