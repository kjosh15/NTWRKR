Thanks for the intro, Ben!

Richard, I'd love to connect if you have time for a call in the next couple
weeks. If you're willing, you can pick a time here
<http://josh.is/scheduling> or suggest something that works for you GMT.

Very much looking forward to it - Ben has told me great things and I'm very
keen to compare notes; based on the data we've collected so far I think
there may be a lot of concurrence!

All best,
Josh
