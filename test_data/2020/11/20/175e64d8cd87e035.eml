Been doing some due diligence to see what else we might need + going
through all the strategy docs. I think we have almost everything we need,
but have to do some formatting so we're equipped to hit investor's requests
as they come in. Here's my master list (note we already have most of these,
albeit in separate docs):


   1. Elevator pitch: Introduction summary of what you do and why. 2-3
   sentences that include our key differentiators, like an elevator pitch i=
n
   writing. For cover letters.
   2. 6 minute pitch deck (approximately 7-8 pages), each page covering the
   key topics, includes brief management talent, basic financial forecast a=
nd
   images of the product.
   3. 1 page executive summary, typically in a two column format. One
   narrow column of simple details =E2=80=93 industry, intro statement, man=
agement
   team, advisors, capital raised, and amount of money seeking and use of
   funds. One wide column of narrative of business description, identified
   problem or need, solution offered, key attributes and basic financial
   forecast.
   4. 10 page or less business plan, which expands on the elements of our
   executive summary, offers product images or screen shots and includes 2
   pages of financial information (1 page financial forecast for first year
   and 1 page for years 2-5 with cash flow).
   5. Full business strategy including marketing strategy & market
   analysis, this may be 20-30 pages

Back up information:

   - Team bios; our management team going from names and titles in the
   summary doc to short bios to full resumes as you get to the due diligenc=
e
   process.
   - NDA
   - Full financials:
      - Basic 90 day look back on the financial performance.
      - Cap table
      - Financial liability (loans or encumbrances)
      - Financing request and use of funds. Basic bullet points in an
      executive summary, 90 day plan for after receipt of funds and
project plans
      for development timelines and operational milestones for due diligenc=
e.
      - Projections:
         - Basic topline, bottom line to show revenues, expenses, and
         profits on a one page document.
         - For the business plan, this should be expanded with the first 12
         months in one table and year 2-5 summarized in another table.
         - For due diligence, they will want to see the full financial
         model.
         - Any agreements with vendors, contractors, employee agreements
         and buy-sell agreements between founders

I'm continuing to read through the strategy docs and am working on putting
together an executive plan structure which highlights the strengths of what
we have now.
