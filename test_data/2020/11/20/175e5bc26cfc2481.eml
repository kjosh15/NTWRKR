My only concern is that it is difficult to get advantage from a =

Chris,

TL;DR: Do we retain the value of the data when/if we step away from the =
strategic partner?


Had a good talk with a friend who has advised on M&A before, which was =
very helpful in articulating the strategic pitch. I'm going to have a =
followup conversation this weekend, but the gist of it was that if we're =
not married to the incoming data set to continue improving, then CVC =
makes great sense as it pushes us ahead 3-5 years into the advanced =
world-changing feature development we're ultimately aimed it, while =
keeping us open to acquisition or ongoing growth once we get there.=20

The main points are:

1. The reason to take CVC + JV is that it gives us immediate access to a =
large customer base, much more rapid access to large data sets, and a =
concomitant acceleration of the really world-changing features of the =
product.

2. This is only rational if this expands our market, regardless of who =
eventually buys us. I.e., are the advantages of the larger data sets =
baked in, or do we need continual access to same data sets to retain the =
market lead? What metadata do we keep regardless of the client's data?=20

3. If the above is true, we've already proven the model with our =
whitelabeled approach. Partnering with a really big incumbent makes =
sense as the access to data and clients outstrips what we've been able =
to produce with smaller partners like Lane 4, meaning that we already =
know how to integrate - which gets us moving even faster.

This approach is all about "we're on the verge of changing the HR =
world!!" From that position a strategic CVC makes good sense because it =
gets us there faster. It ALSO means that we're not looking for M&A - or, =
put another way, M&A would have to come at a really, really good price =
to guarantee us access to the world changing we want to do.=20

Make sense? I'm still working through your docs but feeling much more =
confident now that we're getting our stories and targets straight. Let =
me know if the above aligns.
