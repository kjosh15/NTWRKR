So here's a thing.

Just got off the phone with World 50's D&I group leads. The D&I group now
has 378 members, mostly D&I heads of the equivalent. They've asked me to
talk to the member advisory board head about taking a role there, and also
requested that I work with them directly to address some of their big
challenges.

Those challenges are almost entirely technical. Members are hugely
interested in data; privacy, access, bias, etc. and they want actionable
insights on what to do about it from within companies that range from
mid-size to the biggest.

The team has two main goals they want to achieve, technically. The first is
a collaboration platform to divide the group up into cohorts attacking
specific D&I challenges, so that whatever is learned can be brought back to
everyone. The second is some kind of measurement so that everyone who
participates can compare notes on where they stand with regards to D&I and
measure what's working and how.

World 50 is trying to decide whether it should build its own solution or
work with a partner. You mentioned the other day that you had a framework
you could drop in for measuring D&I values: what if we offered that
framework to W50 members exclusively for a year in exchange for development
costs?

They expect to have 500 members by Q2 2021. That would be a HUGE client
list and access to organizations from the inside, driven by one of the most
high-profile issues those companies face today.

Hell, we could get BSS to run the marketing, UX, and UI issues and charge
W50 to bootstrap the cloud conversion we'd need to meet the scaling costs.

There's challenges here; they've got Vivienne Ming giving a talk on Dec 3
about a framework she's building to detect and measure bias (so maybe we
could collaborate?), and W50 has been notoriously cheap/hesitant to buy
tech solutions. But if we can make it cheap and easy for companies to enter
an org chart and get some basic, useful metrics on bias... I think we could
blow this out of the water.

Let me know what you think - the D&I group heads have asked me to get back
to them any time with any ideas and I'd love to follow up.

- Josh
