YES. Got to this same line of thinking myself last night. If I'm echoing
this back correctly, this means that we've used a whitelabeled approach in
order to get to a minimum viable level of data to prove the product. Once
we have done so through 2021 we'll switch to in-house generation of
business (and simultaneously more diverse feature development) which will
require significant spend to support.

This also, incidentally, echoes the pitch to strategics - we've proved that
we have a valuable product that people will buy. Now (through 2021) we're
proving we have a product that can RADICALLY TRANSFORM THE WORLD OF WORK.

yes?
