Would he by any chance be interested in a conversation? I'd love to get his
take on the world of M&A and would be happy to share my current research
into metrics-driven Future of Work. Curious to see if there's a valuable
exchange there.

Separately, I'm continuing to consider the Future of Work group but am
juggling a couple of other initiatives that are consuming most of my time.
I know you're keen to launch new groups early in next year - I hope to have
more latitude to discuss this shortly!

All best,
Josh
