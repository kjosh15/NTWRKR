Certainly! We met at Amali for lunch in 2013, after meeting at a MoMa event
(I believe!) You put me in touch with a fellow hacker to talk about emails
scripts, and we nominally planned to discuss my doing some writing for you.
Then my wife and I had our first child, and... it's 2020. :)

Let me know if you'd still like to connect!

best,
Josh
