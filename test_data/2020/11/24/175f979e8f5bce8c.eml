Michael,

Wanted to follow up on our conversation last week. I came away with two
topics to pursue:

1) You were going to connect with your psychologist friend with the
framework around empathy to create a BSS-branded version of the Indigo
platform. We've already started looking into how to rework the UX/UI to be
less stat heavy and more empathy leading; if you had a framework for
evaluating what the "right" values are we can help build the platform
around using it to support BSS' business transformation efforts.

2) You'd mentioned your need for someone to sit between big clients and
your teams to articulate tech potential and integrate it into the final
solution. This needs to act as a "pull" for your teams to help bootstrap
technical fluency and drive appetite for leadership in the area.

If it's useful, I'd be happy to work with BSS on this. FWIW, I'd frame the
problem as needing to a) craft the transformation towards tech fluency
internally, b) establish proven external resources for development needs,
and c) establish the narrative around emerging tech in your BD processes.
This is the gist of the strategy I plotted out for a recent client and it
seems to apply directly here.

Let me know if it's worth setting a call to discuss either topic.

Looking forward,
Josh
