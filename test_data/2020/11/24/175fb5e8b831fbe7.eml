Dear Friends and Family,



We hope all finds you well, warm and safe! Dublin is being decorated for
the Christmas Season and we are preparing for our Thanksgiving Feast.



We have a lot to be thankful for this year! Our favorite son, Pierce
married a wonderful woman, Hannah, who will keep challenging him to be the
best version of himself and who is truly his equal (or superior!) in all
aspects of life with the possible exception of leg wrestling.=F0=9F=98=8A O=
ur parents
are healthy and happy, my folks, Susie and Pinky, have built a backyard
oasis during lockdown and Eric=E2=80=99s Mom, Trish, a truly talented artis=
t, has
been hard at work creating amazing paintings! My sister Aimee, quite
possibly the strongest woman I know, is enjoying life and exploring the PNW
with her partner Tony.  My nephews are thriving, Andrew is in his second
year in college at the UW and Langston is all grown up and working in
Portland.  Eric=E2=80=99s sister Michele and husband Michael have been rais=
ing
their wonderful boys and welcomed beautiful grand baby girl into the
world.  And then there is this grand adventure that Eric and I are on
together which has brought us here to Ireland, I am thankful to have such a
loving and supportive partner to continue to grow with!  Eric (writing this
in a weird third person voice as the second author) feels the same.  He is
thankful every day for Marti=E2=80=99s amazing love, infectious joy and con=
stant
support.



The Hunt for Thanksgiving

Here in Ireland, they do not celebrate Thanksgiving.  However, they do seem
to celebrate Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Since we cannot be with friends
and family this year, Eric and I are determined to create the traditional
Thanksgiving meal.  This has proven more difficult than first thought as
many of our traditional dishes are very foreign to Irish Cuisine.  I was
able to track down some French=E2=80=99s Fried Onions in the American secti=
on of
our local SuperValu where you can also find Butterfinger candy bars and
Marshmallow Spread.  The corn meal for the cornbread stuffing was finally
located at the Asian Supermarket after mistakenly purchasing corn flour
which is really just corn starch.  The most difficult item to find was by
far the pumpkin puree for the pie which had to be ordered on-line at a
ridiculously high price. It arrived yesterday and we are now all set with
just a few more common items to pick up from the grocery tomorrow.



The Hunt for a Home

One thing that has been great about looking for a house during level 5
lock-down is that it allows us to get outside of our 5km radius and do a
little exploring.  We went up to the Athlone (the geographical center of
the country) area and looked at 3 houses sightseeing between each viewing.
We went to the Heritage park in Moat and almost got stuck in the park
because it required a 2 euro coin to get out and we had no change.  Luckily
we were able to track down a woman who provided us with a token for the
parking gate.  We went to see a private castle which resulted in being
chased down the drive by a very animated dog.  We also went to Fore Abbey
which is just north of Mullingar.  It was first established by Saint Fechin
in 630 and it is said that the water from the well there does not boil.

Last weekend we went down south to look at 3 more houses in the Waterford
Area which again afforded us the pleasure of sightseeing between viewings.
We went on a lovely walk along the River Nore in Kilkenny.  Kilkenny is a
medieval city built by the Normans in the tenth century.  We had lunch in
New Ross on the River Barrow,  which is where the Kennedy family is from
and did a self-guided walking tour following the orange signs and looking
out for blue plaques!



Some Great News

We ended up putting an offer on one of the houses near Athlone.  It is on
11 acres and has an incredible barn which we are starting to make plans for
(our ideas may be bigger than the barn itself).  Our offer was accepted and
we are going through the various processes of lining up inspectors and
working with the bank and our solicitor now.  We=E2=80=99re pretty excited =
but it
usually takes 30-60 days until the sale is finalized.  Here is a link to
our (fingers crossed) new home:
