Firstly, I hope you and yours are well and healthy!!

Secondly, I have a startup <http://indigometrics.com> that's about to seek
funding. I expect we're too early for you, but it's as good an excuse as I
can think of to reconnect and compare notes. Let me know if you have any
time GMT (I'm in Iceland ATM) to catch up!!

All best wishes,
Josh
