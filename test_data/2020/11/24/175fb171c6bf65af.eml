Long time no speak - not since your NN-Group leadership conference in 2015!
As we approach the end of 2020, and look with hope at 2021, I wanted to
touch base on what you're doing and how/where technology innovation might
play a role.

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help,
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

IndigoMetrics <http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf>; an
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees.
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g>;
a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence
Covid!)
Professional Services <http://www.josh.is/>: as ever, I continue to work
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new
innovation / product development.
