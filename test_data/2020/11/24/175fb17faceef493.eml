HITEC, Austin 6/16/2015 -

Long time no speak - not since your HITEC event in 2015! As we approach the
end of 2020, and look with hope at 2021, I wanted to touch base on what
you're doing and how/where technology innovation might play a role.

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help,
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
