This is great!! I reworked it a bit to make it simpler and more direct, and
also tried to shift the emphasis towards the evolutionary aspects of the
system. Let me know if the below still fits the remit:

#######

=E2=80=9CDiversity and Inclusion =E2=80=93 Helping your organisation walk t=
he talk=E2=80=9D

All of us are facing a Diversity and Inclusion challenge today. But most
companies don't have good data on where they actually stand.

This is where Indigometrics can help.

You tell us the most important D&I values you want to inculcate in your
workplace =E2=80=93 defined however is appropriate to your organization [ s=
creen
shows competencies, values, behavioural model, leadership model ]

And we=E2=80=99ll use our AI driven peer to peer review platform to provide=
 you
with data that tells you which of these behaviours your employees are
demonstrating well day to day =E2=80=93 and which they aren=E2=80=99t

We can measure both your D+I focussed behaviours as well as other target
behaviours, or soft skills =E2=80=93 so the data is well rounded and helps =
you
embed real D+I transformation into the core of your company for the long
term... and not just as a short-term exercise.

And our platform and algorithms are specifically designed to address human
bias and protect employee privacy =E2=80=93 so you can use these metrics to
consistently assess employees behavior =E2=80=93 no matter what they look l=
ike.

This helps you take the bias out of your promotion and recognition systems
=E2=80=93 again benefiting your D+I efforts.

So how does it work? Well, the platform uses an expert system to help your
employees give each other feedback on the specific actions, behaviours, and
values that are important to your organisation.

Every week each employee answers 6 questions about 5 of their peers, a
process that takes less than 3 minutes.

The questions and reviewees change over time to quickly build up a
multi-dimensional assessment of each individual=E2=80=99s behaviours.

Importantly, the behaviours measured are unique to your organisation, and
can be dynamically re-focused as your internal goals or your external
environment changes.

After each survey, employees receive continuous, consistent feedback around
the quality of their behaviours in a way that respects their privacy and
points them towards self improvement - not competition.

Managers receive a clear and specific assessment of each of their team
members=E2=80=99 soft skills, putting them in a position to help each team =
member
develop within the framework set by your organisation.

Leaders receive a consistent, timely, and ongoing data dashboard helping
them make cultural decisions that drive results - and are backed by real
data.

And your D+I leaders receive clear, unbiased metrics on where and how their
initiatives are actually advancing the company =E2=80=93 allowing specific =
cultural
change initiatives to drive real day to day D+I results.

IndigoMetrics. Helping your corporate culture evolve.
