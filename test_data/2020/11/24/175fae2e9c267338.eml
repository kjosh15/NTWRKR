These guys recently reached back out to me:

ilovespacestation.com

I spoke with them about some ideas almost a decade ago but apparently
they're now deeply in bed with CNN. They're getting asked for "Anthony
Bordaine" type travelogue shows around technology. Can I toss them the
Smart World pitch also?

Really don't know if this is appropriate or not so you'll have to smack my
hand if I'm misstepping - but would rather ask and be wrong than miss an
opp!
