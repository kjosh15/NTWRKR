Thank you so much, Inge!!! Very glad to hear you're both doing well. We've
since moved to Iceland (in case you want to do a home swap up north some
time!) but otherwise are all very well also.

Please do let us know if we can ever be of future help, and thank you so
much for staying in touch!

All best,
Josh
