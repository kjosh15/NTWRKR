So sorry to be slow on the response here; I have a friend who just started
chemo who was scheduled for that time and I'm waiting to hear if he's able
to move it. Obviously I don't want to push him.

Happy to make 7am tentative in case that's a time you're up and about
anyway, and otherwise could also do 9:30am PST if that's better!

Much appreciated,
Josh
