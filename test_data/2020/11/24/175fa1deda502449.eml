Does this make sense?

###

Gustavo,

Thanks again for the conversation this weekend; as ever, it was super
useful to both clarify our joint plans as well as to hear how things are
going in the US!

Here's what I heard as take-aways:

- You're going to decide on staying/not staying by the end of November
- You'll have everything you're not using packed up by then and we can do a
video preview of anything left
- If you're staying, we'll figure out what you want to buy/keep then
- If you're not, we'll out how to sell everything then.

I also did some research, and it looks like we may have some protections
around your staying if you want to. See this article:

https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/month-to-month-apartment-lease-when-c=
an-i-move-how-much-notice-landlord-nyc

TL;DR:

1) The landlords have to give you 30 days notice to vacate. That means that
once they cash your check you're good for the month and have 30 days from
any notice they give you to vacate - and the notice can only come at the
end of that month. I *think* this means that if they cash a check from you
for January, for example, the soonest they could request you to be out
would be end of February.

No idea what this means in terms of rates, etc. but it should give you good
negotiating room in asking for a lease, especially given that it's the turn
of the year. Additionally, if they try to jack the rent up or refuse to
cash your check they have to give you two weeks (after serving a formal
notice!) before they can file for eviction. So there are lots of
protections.

2) Please check our lease (in the green metal file box in the bottom
cabinet on the lefthand side) to see if we have to give longer notice
before terminating our agreement with them. (Feel free to take pictures of
the latest lease and I'll review it.) I believe we have to give at least 30
days notice to vacate, meaning that along with our check for December we
need to notify them that you'll be taking over. (

ate-month-month-tenancy.html)


3) One option would be to send them a check from *you* for December, and if
they cash it you're then on a month to month agreement with them going
forward. If we time it right, they may cash it without realizing it and
before we send our notice to vacate. We'd have to do this today or tomorrow
as our payment is currently set to go out tomorrow.

Otherwise we can just give them notice Dec 1 and simultaniously inform them
of your desire to take on a 6-month lease at the same time - or that you'll
send them a check for month-to-month. No idea how they would respond, but
if they don't cash it I believe they have to serve you with a 2-week notice
at least.

Lots to consider there, so let me know how I can help.

All best,
Josh
