Long time no speak - not since your XXXX! As we approach the end of 2020, 
and look with hope at 2021, I wanted to touch base on what you're doing and 
how/where technology innovation might play a role. 

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a 
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help, 
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

IndigoMetrics <http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf>; an 
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. 
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g>; 
a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce 
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence 
Covid!)
Professional Services <http://www.josh.is/>: as ever, I continue to work 
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new 
innovation / product development.
