Nikole,

Long time no speak! I hope you and yours are well and healthy.

The IndigoMetrics platform is getting a number of opportunities in support
of D&I initiatives, but we're still struggling to find a cohesive
framework. The biggest problem is that based on our experience we see D&I
measurement as being most effective when embedded in a larger framework of
the overall corporate culture.

But we're being asked for a set of D&I measurements, solo. To date we have
a number of action statements around D&I behavior, but no clear buckets for
them. Additionally, we're struggling with the framing of "J treats others
how they would like to be treated themselves" vs. "J treats everyone how
they would like to be treated."

Do you have any feeling for the relative value of the above, and/or any
suggestions on a generalizable D&I framework that would add value across
any organization?

And finally, how the hell are you?!? Let me know what you're up to these
days and how I can help.

All best wishes,
Josh
