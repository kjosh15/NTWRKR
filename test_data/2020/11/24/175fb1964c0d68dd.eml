Long time no speak - not since your 99U event in 2016! As we approach the
end of 2020, and look with hope at 2021, I wanted to touch base on what
you're doing and how/where technology innovation might play a role.

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help,
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees.
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=

a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence
Covid!)

with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new
innovation / product development.
