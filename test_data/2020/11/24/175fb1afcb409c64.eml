Long time no speak! I wanted to touch base on what you're doing and see if
I can help!

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help,
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein

IndigoMetrics <http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf>; an
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees.
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g>;
a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence
Covid!)
Professional Services <http://www.josh.is/>: as ever, I continue to work
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new
innovation / product development.
