Long time no speak - not since the IWNY event in 2013! As we approach the
end of 2020 - and look with hope at 2021 - I wanted to touch base on what
you're doing and see if I could help.

I've included my current project list below, but would welcome a
conversation with you about what you're up to. Let me know if I can help,
and/or if it's worth a conversation!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
