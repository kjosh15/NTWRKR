Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/edward_cook%40comcast.net/1ea94a98-ccdf-4f8e-af84-f1e1272b474f) and =
I'll make sure not to email you in the future!

I figured I'd try something different. We've worked together before, and =
more importantly you're someone I *enjoyed* working with, and would work =
with again. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; reply with an =
update on your current projects, or let's schedule a time and chat!

Looking forward to reconnecting,

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an =
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. =
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
