Craig,

My business partner and I are both excited about the opportunity; your
values are clear and easily articulated, so it should be quick to set up
the system to get started. The biggest need would be for a senior manager
who could stand up and say this is important and to help confirm the action
statements associated with each value.

In terms of reference, I'd note that the national England rugby team is one
of our first clients. Similarly, we are currently talking to London=E2=80=
=99s
Metropolitan Police about something similar but based on more generalized
behavior change; so some experience there working with public institutions.

I've attached our deck - the site is at www.indigometrics.com - and am
happy to walk you through our sandbox to demonstrate the functionality if
that's useful. If you're keen we can set up a specific instance and discuss
what a pilot rollout would look like.

Sincerely,
Josh


=E1=90=A7
