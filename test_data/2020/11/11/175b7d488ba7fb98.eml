Thanks Josh and sorry for the delay in response! It's been a bit crazy here
at A-Speakers the past several months as I am sure you have experienced on
your end. Esteban is no longer with the company and I am currently the
Booking Agent for North and So America. In any case, I would love to get an
update on how you have been doing and what your virtual talks look like.
Let me know if there's time later this week or next to connect and please
share any materials in the meantime.

Regards,

Justin
