Talked to Molly and learned a ton - looks like she's got a lot on her
plate! Shortly thereafter heard from Laura that she hopes I'm doing well
and will def. keep in touch.

Let me know if you've got anything on your side of the house that needs
some tech / innovation strategy - or if you end up playing with GPT-3!!

All best,
Josh

Just spoke with Molly; sounds like she&#39;s got a lot on her plate! But al=
so so much potential; exciting to hear her role and remit has been official=
ly created within GSM. She&#39;s going to talk to Laura and we&#39;ll see i=
f there&#39;s room for me to lend a hand - many
 thanks for the intro!!<br>
<br>
Separately, I just finished helping advise on a pitch for a TV series using=
 GPT-3 to engage with protagonists of divisive issues and isolate winning s=
emantic arguments. You&#39;d love this stuff - have you played with their A=
PI at all?? Generalized AI (or the indistinguishable
 appearance thereof) is getting close...<br>
<br>
All best wishes and thanks again,<br>

&gt; Hey Josh - happy autumn :-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =C2=A0<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Wondering if there was any interest at Corning for a CISO or senior ap=
p-sec person to join a Department of Commerce Software Transparency working=
 group focused on SBOMS from third-party suppliers. The Healthcare Proof of=
 Concept group, which includes Abbott,
 Medtronic, Thermo Fisher, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, NY Presbyterian and othe=
rs, is already in Phase 2. There are the beginnings of similar groups formi=
ng in Automotive and Energy. If Corning wanted to participate or anchor a M=
anufacturing, the Department of
 Commerce would certainly welcome that. <br>
&gt;<br>
