Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/enegren%40gmail.com/53b6f9fd-1860-474b-9fd3-ed8ecb6b526c) and I'll make=
 sure not to email you in the future!

I figured I'd try something =

someone I *enjoyed* working with, and would work with again. Below is a =
shortlist of my current projects; reply with an update on your current =
projects, or let's schedule a time and chat!

Looking forward to =
reconnecting,

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.=
indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for =
autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if =
you've got staff that are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor =
Testing(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asB=
vSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project to understand how to use physically embedded =
sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and =
diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/):=
 as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology =
transformation and new innovation / product development.
