Ben,

Thanks again for the call yesterday; it was so good to catch up!! I'd
mentioned a few contacts - take a look and let me know if/which you'd like
an intro to:


   - Texas Crew Productions (www.texascrew.com) - I've worked on a couple
   tv pitches and really like them, but they're not especially deep into
   Netflix yet. Could be useful for context, however, as they've done a lot=
 of
   different kinds of work.
   - NHNZ.TV - I've done two series with these guys; they're apparently now
   well connected with Netflix. Based in NZ.
   - grrco.com - This is my friend Matt; we're pitching an AI-powered show
   together atm and he's great. Worth talking to regardless of what you
   do, he's got a very very cutting edge understanding of the media landsca=
pe
   today.
   - Alan Gershenfeld - Head of elinemedia.com. If you're into narrative,
   he's worth talking to. Plus, he built a game about the arctic and is dee=
ply
   focused on environmental issues. If nothing else I suspect you'd enjoy e=
ach
   other!


Separately, I'd love an intro to your former Korn Ferry senior guy, the one
who is now at electrocomponents, to talk about IndigoMetrics.com

On a different tack, I'd also love to talk to both Jack Kreindler and Sami
Inkinen about the CGM project if that's still possible.

Very much obliged - keep in touch and looking forward to hearing about more
adventures soon!

All best,
Josh
