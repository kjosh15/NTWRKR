Wanted to clarify something I think has been in the air but perhaps not
explicitly stated; I'm focusing on strategic b/c having a big vision - and
portraying that in a compelling way - is critical path for acquisition, but
also a BIG part of what's going to drive our raise rate (IMHO). Let me know
if you feel like those two are at odds; they should be complimentary, but I
realized it's a framing I've been working in without making explicit.
