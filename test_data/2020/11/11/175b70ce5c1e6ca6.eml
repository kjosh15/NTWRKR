So cool!! Very interesting stuff - especially love ACDC. :)

I'm working on three things (below); how can I help what you're developing?

All best,
Josh

##

IndigoMetrics
<http://tracking.josh.is/prod/c9d51b7d-d80f-4628-bae4-ce3b83120056/a552f3e8=
-686b-4944-92e5-cf9f206c4bb2>;
an AI platform for autonomously supporting and transforming employee
behavior. Super useful for remote staff and managers who need to be able to
metric corporate culture at scale.

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing
<http://tracking.josh.is/prod/c9d51b7d-d80f-4628-bae4-ce3b83120056/97f18b5a=
-0ab5-47e4-93b8-645f6d45c476>;
a project to understand how to use new glucose sensors to reduce the health
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

Professional Services

-3000-42f1-85bb-59eb12c32f0b>:
as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on technology
strategy and new innovation / product development.
