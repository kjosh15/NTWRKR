Dear Derek, Sanaz,

Christine Lancman suggested we connect with you directly. Trevor recently
spoke to a group of us at World 50's Innovating 50 Group, where I'm a
special technology advisor.

At the event, Trevor mentioned working with Microsoft and said that it was
like being Charlie at the Chocolate Factory. The timing was striking as
I've been building a TV series around Microsoft's new artificial
intelligence tech, called GPT-3.

It=E2=80=99s a show that uses GPT-3's AI to persuade Americans to see the o=
ther
side of divisive issues - exposing the weirdness in the arguments that work
in the process.

Trevor said "comedians place you in a world where things aren't completely
real so you can deal with what is real." We're looking for an executive
producer with experience in comedy and news that really gets that. Let us
know if the attached fits his interest!

All best,
Josh Klein
