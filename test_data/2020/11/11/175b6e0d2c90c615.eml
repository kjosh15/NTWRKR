Had 7 zoom sessions yesterday, 6 lined up for today - my networking is
starting to kick into high gear now that we have a website I can send out!!

So far I've got another consultancy in NYC that wants to try the platform,
one lead on a potential client (head of innovation for electrocomponents.co=
m),
three conversations with developers advising on how/who to hire for our
tech build, a few investor leads, and a bunch of execs from the World 50
summit getting scheduled. All good stuff, but has slowed my turnaround
time. Let's discuss tomorrow!!
