Lets discuss =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99m still getting my head around it =
=E2=80=93 but increasingly I=E2=80=99m thinking that strategic is maybe =
something a Series A investor doesn=E2=80=99t want to hear =E2=80=93 =
(even if we might be thinking it) I think they would worry that =
(exclusive) strategic would cap their upside =E2=80=93 and maybe we need =
to find a vision that allows us to have multiple strategics.

=20

So our current Series A and Strategic pitches maybe have quite a =
different focus:

=20

Series A:

*	Money initially to increase robustness, add features and add a =
smallish number of marquee customers
*	Then we will need to be nimble and astute to plot a course from then =
on to cement our position in the centre of workplace culture analytics =
and maximise value
*	Our exact course of action will depend on the situation in 1 or 2 =
years time but we expect to follow a multiple strategic partner route =
whilst incentivising strategic partners to share data through our =
central repository. Essentially you only get insights from the central =
data repository if you put data in =E2=80=93 and if you put data in you =
also get equity in either the central repository or a sub of =
IndigoMetrics that owns the workplace IP
*	This is a version of the strategy that took MarkIt to a $5bn valuation =
8 years after inception
*	It is of course probable that we get offers for exclusive strategic =
partnerships, we will consider them together with investors as they =
arise

=20

Strategic:

*	We have offers of $3m for 10% of the company that will allow us to =
grow as an independent company
*	However our expectation is that we will ultimately sell to a strategic =
partner at a valuation of around $120 in 3 to 5 years time
*	So we would like to explore whether we are better off doing the =
strategic partnership now as this would allow us to grow more quickly in =
the next few years
*	Our proposal is that we form a small team within your organisation to =
re-build our software according to your standards and to allow seamless =
integration=20
*	We would also continue to manage our current deal pipeline and build =
out functionality in parallel. So you get the possibility of moving our =
existing customers to your platform
*	We would like to keep our team as small as possible =E2=80=93 we are =
not big corporate man managers =E2=80=93 and leverage any resources that =
you have =20
*	The aim is to get a version of Indigometrics into the hands of your =
salesforce as soon as possible=20
*	We will also be high vision exponents in the culture analytics field, =
allowing you to both product differentiate and change/improve perception =
around your firm

=20

I just made the above up on the fly =E2=80=93 thoughts?

Wanted to clarify something I think has been in the air but perhaps not =
explicitly stated; I'm focusing on strategic b/c having a big vision - =
and portraying that in a compelling way - is critical path for =
acquisition, but also a BIG part of what's going to drive our raise rate =
(IMHO). Let me know if you feel like those two are at odds; they should =
be complimentary, but I realized it's a framing I've been working in =
without making explicit.=20

Had 7 zoom sessions yesterday, 6 lined up for today - my networking is =
starting to kick into high gear now that we have a website I can send =
out!!

=20

So far I've got another consultancy in NYC that wants to try the =
platform, one lead on a potential client (head of innovation for =
electrocomponents.com <http://electrocomponents.com> ), three =
conversations with developers advising on how/who to hire for our tech =
build, a few investor leads, and a bunch of execs from the World 50 =
summit getting scheduled. All good stuff, but has slowed my turnaround =
time. Let's discuss tomorrow!!
