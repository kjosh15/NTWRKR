Holly,

Thanks so much for the conversation! It was massively helpful and I'm
excited to talk to Tabby; it sounds like WhatIf is in an interesting place
with a really powerful set of new capabilities at hand.

In terms of culture analytics, I've attached our overview deck but
encourage you to go kick the tires in our sandbox:

URL: http://reviews.indigometrics.com/
USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$

It has all the bells and whistles turned on so it's a bit crowded (normally
you'd pick and choose features depending on what campaigns you're running),
but it's the best way to get an overview of the kinds of data the platform
can collect and provide. Let me know if you have any questions I can
answer for you prior to your monthly meeting!

Very much obliged,
Josh
