Hey Eve! Glad to hear you're doing well all things considered; this
pandemic has certainly been hard on everyone and I'm glad to hear you at
least have a safe place to be - even if it's just to be doing nothing!

We're in Iceland until May, and we'll see in the coming week or so whether
that's a long- or short-term plan. Interesting times... Be well and keep us
posted. We're sending well wishes from snowy Iceland!

All the best,
Josh
