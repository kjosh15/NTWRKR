the startups are looking for, but they don=E2=80=99t have budget for =
consultancy.  The real value in the services that you are offering from =
your experience and consulting will be be sought after when people have =
gotten to know you. Which seems not to to be a big threshold in your =
case. :)  Your text is delivering this very well I think but we could =
perhaps spear it a little bit better for each intro. I think this one =
works well for the startup intro but we need a different approach for =
the Iceland Export office for example.  I suggest that we arrange =
another meeting later this week or next week - and then I can also get =
to know better your background and what suits best for each intro (so =
that there is more credability in each of these).  How about that?=20
>=20
> Regarding the Unity - yes definitely internationally - the Icelandic =
programmers are too few and too expensive - and yet often lacking in =
experience.  So if we can find someone great or a great studio that can =
do this then that would be great.  I am talking to a few companies in =
the East but we will have to see their skill sets.  New York studios are =
probably crazy expensive - but we might find a great freelancing =
programmer there who would cost an arm and a leg.  Experience in Unity =
is needed,outstanding programming skills (front and backend) and =
although the project is not terribly complicated I strive to find great =
programmers whereas those who are mediocre are 1/10th of the value of =
the outstanding ones. Experience in App Store, Google Play and Steam =
launch is also important.  This would  probably be a studio rather than =
a 1 man=E2=80=99s show (or a 1 woman=E2=80=99s show) but if you know =
someone or hear of someone then please feel free to make an =
introduction.=20
>=20
> Another thing actually that you might possibly be able to help me with =
is finding a person to manage the digital marketing part.  We are =
working with a marketing office and we will make the strategy ourselves =
but managing the facebook, Google and App Store ads and do all the =
tailoring and monitoring to get the aquisition cost down, conversion =
rates up and so forth  -  If you know someone great for that then I will =
need that someone soon as well.  :)=20

class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">I would say that the =
pickup-line for the companies over here is your network and access to =
that. Business opportunities and money is what all the startups are =
looking for, but they don=E2=80=99t have budget for consultancy.&nbsp; =
The real value in the services that you are offering from your =
experience and consulting will be be sought after when people have =
gotten to know you. Which seems not to to be a big threshold in your =
case. :) &nbsp;Your text is delivering this very well I think but we =
could perhaps spear it a little bit better for each intro. I think this =
one works well for the startup intro but we need a different approach =
for the Iceland Export office for example.&nbsp; I suggest that we =
arrange another meeting later this week or next week - and then I can =
also get to know better your background and what suits best for each =
intro (so that there is more credability in each of these).&nbsp; How =
about that?&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Regarding the Unity - yes definitely internationally - the =
Icelandic programmers are too few and too expensive - and yet often =
lacking in experience.&nbsp; So if we can find someone great or a great =
studio that can do this then that would be great.&nbsp; I am talking to =
a few companies in the East but we will have to see their skill =
sets.&nbsp; New York studios are probably crazy expensive - but we might =
find a great freelancing programmer there who would cost an arm and a =
leg.&nbsp; Experience in Unity is needed,outstanding programming skills =
(front and backend) and although the project is not terribly complicated =
I strive to find great programmers whereas those who are mediocre are =
1/10th of the value of the outstanding ones. Experience in App Store, =
Google Play and Steam launch is also important.&nbsp; This would =
&nbsp;probably be a studio rather than a 1 man=E2=80=99s show (or a 1 =
woman=E2=80=99s show) but if you know someone or hear of someone then =
please feel free to make an introduction.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Another thing actually that you might =
possibly be able to help me with is finding a person to manage the =
digital marketing part.&nbsp; We are working with a marketing office and =
we will make the strategy ourselves but managing the facebook, Google =
and App Store ads and do all the tailoring and monitoring to get the =
aquisition cost down, conversion rates up and so forth &nbsp;- &nbsp;If =
you know someone great for that then I will need that someone soon as =
well. &nbsp;:)&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">No stress - and please don=E2=80=99t feel either that you =
have to find these people.&nbsp; Me helping you, if I can, is at no cost =
- just to be clear on that (and that includes networking or =
intro-obligations as well). &nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
