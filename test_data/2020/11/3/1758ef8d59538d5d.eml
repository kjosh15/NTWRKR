Perfect! I just sent an invite.

Mainly I'm keen to catch up and to see what you're working on now. On my
side, I'm juggling a project on measuring culture (aiming to transform
organizational structure to improve equity) and am curious if you see
parallels to government. I'm also preparing to pitch a project using
continuous glucose monitors to prompt behavior change underlying diabetes,
obesity, and heart disease.

That said, this isn't a pitch and I'm not trying to solicit your
involvement in anything - I just admire the work you've done and am keen to
see if there's any way we can help each other. Since the pandemic I've seen
a lot of folks spamming others in an attempt to generate business. I'm

putation+economics>)
and now I'm putting it into practice!

If that still appeals I look forward to hearing from you - and if not feel
free to back out; I don't want to waste anyone's time!

All best wishes,
Josh
