So glad to hear you caught the stroke - what good fortune!! I wasn't clear
what the two pitches you were bringing to Orpyx were though; can you
clarify?

Looking forward,
Josh

> Hi Josh,
> The company I will be approaching for my two projects is Orpyx. When I
opened your email last week, there were two very glaring reasons why I
think you should connect with this company; firstly, they have the sensor
technology specific to diabetes as that's the core of what they address.
Secondly, they are well underway, on the other side of the fence on all the
medical/hospital bureaucracy for lack of better words. I'll post their web
link below, for you to get a feel for them and I can't express this enough,
look at their team. Being that your concept is much closer to their core
address than to mine, you could approach them solo,, I had thought about
tag teaming your concept along with mine but then reconsidered this as it
tends to muddle focus, nobody really likes pot pourri.
>
> I'll just nutshell my two concepts here as my presentations are in a
format specific to Orpyx. Initially, the reason I wanted to reach out to
them regards a concept I had in 2004, had an oral evaluation by James
Levine at Watson Labs and was deemed of (at that time) that the technology
needed wasn't yet available. Over the years since then, not only has the
tech come to par but exceeded it with other technologies that can be worked
in, and of course Big Data and all such things. That concept is to assist
paraplegics and quadriplegics not only maneuver their equipment and chairs
with greater ease but affordably manipulate their mouse on their computer
and/or smartphone at near par of you or I. Other aspects of that unit would
provide real-time data of their immediate health and covid or similar to
their doctors or researchers.
>
> The second concept has real-world background; this past July, after a
series of tests to figure out something with irregularities in my heart
function, I caught on that something was about to occur following a test.
Went to emergency and they took me directly into the hospital where I spent
a week. The doctors said that; had I ignored what was happening and went to
bed, I would have either awoken while having a stroke, woken with a stroke
or not woken at all. Very sobering. What was funny was, I was to have a
teleconferencing regarding the other concept with a venture firm that were
going to help me see other avenues in my presentation of it. But there I
laid in a hospital bed, not only picking the specialists brains for my own
health but to better understand to better address how to have others avert
such a catastrophe.
>
> The reason for my near stroke; all the tests that were being performed
regarded my heart, which tests kept coming back as very healthy. It was a
stress test on a treadmill in the morning that kicked in my near stroke in
the afternoon. The doctor at that clinic said "your heart is fine, you can
go home". My heart was fine according to the hospital specialists, however,
the branches into my lungs showed bilateral blood clots on my lungs.
>
> And had the cardiologists and pulmonary specialists not let me know why
this happened, I wouldn't have set out to create this concept. It was so
shocking (not post-covid related anything) that I replied in half words
with head shakes; Excessive Driving.
>
> My job at that time was setting up a western office for a larger eastern
Canadian company and involved at least 1500+ KM's a week to service and
acquaint with customers.
>
> Depending on body type and we hear of this common thrombosis occurrence
on frequent flyers, frequent driving creates a myriad of major health
issues. Stepping on the gas, stopping at a red light and repeating the
cycles within a day, plus distance, sitting, creates compression. Some
people get numb leg, some get heart palpitations,,, which, like me, were
brushed off to coffee intake over the workday and common work stress.
>
> That concept is fairly straightforward, but I see something other in it
than ones health; it can provide true big-data on what automobiles are
worse for long distances. This could serve companies creating fleets, or
auto-manufacturers redesigning car/truck seats, researchers better
understand compression thrombosis,, it could, if worked with your Indigo AI
(this just popped into my head) to give other understandings of "Well
Being".
>
> Josh, last week while we were email tagging, I was being directed by my
doctor and another specialist to go to labs for more blood-work and other
unpleasant tests. Because of covid, labs are backed up and it was like a
scene from a bad treasure hunt movie, trying to get same day tests, fasting
for one only not to get a test and then trying to figure out another moment
to fast again, yet eat. All's good now before the next series of follow up
work. That was last week, it was comical.
