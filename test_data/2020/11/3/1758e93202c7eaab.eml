Ellie,

Had a brief call w/ Jen (Padma was unable to attend at the last minute)
from Takeda last night. Essentially they got hit with a deluge of work and
restructuring, but are interested in setting up a contract to start in
Jan., working mostly w/ Luis, one of his direct reports, and his
replacement. The role would still be reporting directly into Padma.

Next steps are for me to talk to the three mentioned above and see if / how
my original scope of work fits. Based on that I'll work w/ Jen to try to
get a contract for 1/4 to 1/2 time advising to start early January.

To that end she requested that she contract me directly to save paperwork;
I explained Korn Ferry would have to figure out how they want that managed.
What needs to happen to get that end of things wrapped up?

Much obliged,
Josh
