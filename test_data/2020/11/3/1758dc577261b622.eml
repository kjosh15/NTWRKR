I hope you and yours are doing well and staying healthy. It's an
interesting time today for all of us!!

Wanted to email just to check in and see if I could be of any help. If it's
interesting, I recently ran into a fellow who wants to build an event
aggregation platform to capitalize on the post-Covid zoom event world.
Figured you'd have a good take on it. (Attached - only if piqued!)

As ever, always glad to be of help if I'm able. I hope you're staying
healthy and sane out there!!

All best from snowy Iceland,
Josh
