Christ on a stick, time flies. We're in Iceland on a farm out in the
countryside; I'm starting to appreciate what a bit of space can do for
you!! Also, we've got a smokehouse so I'm getting deep into biltong and
smoked lamb, which is pretty fun...

Just checking in to say hi and I hope you all are well. Was working on an
advisory piece for a GPT-3 powered TV series in between baking sourdough
and smoking game and realized it all made me think of you. Let me know if
anything interesting is rocking your world these days!

All best,
Josh
