Fantastic!!! A bit text heavy, though - do you think some additional
formatting (even on top of making the text denser) would help skimming and
pulling out the highlines? Also I caught a few grammatical errors; could
you share an editable doc and we can more quickly back and forth? Otherwise
overall it looks great - excited to see what we can do with this!! Gotta
say discovering that GPT-3 ("G" not "C", btw!) has an API and it's easy to
game the application process was a game changer!
