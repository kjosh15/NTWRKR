Just have to throw in here as Steve is being way too modest - he did a TON
of work testing, retesting, designing and redesigning a load of different
models, electronics, software, recording all the videos, etc. etc. This
project wouldn't exist anymore if it weren't for the countless hours he put
into this!!!

Jay, whereabouts are you testing, and do you have cameras, etc. set up to
help with monitoring progress?

Hi Jay- happy to help. I wish I could have gotten to you sooner, but let&#3=

 and the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected=
 a couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards a=
re of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with so=
me of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the=
 board, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNo=

:2.8in">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power supply issue so we should c=
heck a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, or rule it out and l=
ook for another cause. I know of two builds which had power supply issues a=
nd both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be e=
asily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t really be able to d=
irect the servo to do. At least, not in the order you described.</p></div><=

><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">First, a fact about ser=
vo operation: When the servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amo=
unt of current. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem wit=
h the power supply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the A=
rduino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbo=
x reboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then =
step-close it. This could explain why your lid behaves the way it does.</p>=

iv><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">Here are three p=
roblems I&#39;d like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=
=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D=
"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">1) If you are running your electron=
ics tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via USB, you st=
ill need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull about=
 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enough to run the=
 board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div><div><=
p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p c=
lass=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">2) Make sure the power suppl=
y you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires about =
50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which c=
an brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s an=
y additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recom=
mend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of avail=
able current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8=
in">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in"=
>3) If you are already using a power supply, and the power supply is rated =
for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of=
 the two power supply-related problems I know of, one person was using a ve=
ry weak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp powe=
r supply that was faulty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><di=
