Happy to pick up something locally if you have something in mind, and we
can just deduct the costs from the catfood transfers if you're ok with
that.

If you could talk to the folks that'd be grand.

I think the folks are planning on passing on an XMas visit b/c of Covid,
but you'll want to confirm with them. My impression is they see Seattle as
a hotbed of the virus and no need to put you and/or themselves at risk.

Hope you had a great thanksgiving; sending lots of love!!

xoxo,
Josh
