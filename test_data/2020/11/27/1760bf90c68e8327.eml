Sure, I've set it so that it reads

    prgmr% dig -t any -q _dmarc.josh.is @localhost
    [...]
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    _dmarc.josh.is.         86400   IN      TXT     "v=DMARC1;
    p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@josh.is"

(Note the different spelling of "quarantine", but I think that's 
correct.)  It should propagate out within the next day or so.

I found it hilarious.  Unaccented Russian to my ear, and I wouldn't be 
at all surprised to find out that it was produced in Russia.  I've yet 
to get Sveta to watch it, though, she may have different ideas.

Huh, that's an unexpected wrinkle, though it sounds very familiar to me 
as well.  (A conversation from this morning: "Tonia, try some pecan pie, 
you might like it."  "Фу, dis/gus/ting." "You've never tried it.  It's 
really sweet, you might like it." "Ugh, it can't /possibly/ be sweet, 
it's dis/gus/ting.") It appears that I can print a custom paperback book 
through Barnes and Noble for around $5, though, so depending on how 
motivated I get I may send you one in that format.  What's your mailing 
address over there?

Hope you had a happy Thanksgiving, though I guess that's not much of a 
thing outside North America :)

Take care,

-Konrad
