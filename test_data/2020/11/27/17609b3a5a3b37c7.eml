Spoke to the WhatIf? team just now and they seem very keen; they want me to
talk to their culture people and also asked for pricing and rollout info. I
was going to send them our standard onramping documents unless you have a
more updated pricing scheme you wanted to use? I ask as if they go for it
we can upsell directly into Accenture, which could lead to a CVC/JV/M&A
conversation.
