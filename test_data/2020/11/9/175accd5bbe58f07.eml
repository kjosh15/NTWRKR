BRILLIANT. Thanks so so much for this!!

Let me know when you're around for a brief call; would still like to
connect to talk about forks, the future of the project, etc. etc.

Lately we've had an opportunity to do some troubleshooting with a few users
who have finished building their Crowboxes to discover that they see
different behavior from their Crowbox during final testing than what's
depicted in the Crowbox build/setup videos that we provided.

Specifically, this 'erratic behavior' issue involves a Crowbox that won't
smoothly open or close the sliding reward lid. Usually the servo that
controls the lid will move only a short distance and stop, or rotate
erratically at random intervals. We have dealt with six cases of this type
of problem.

We've worked with each user who raised this issue with us and stayed with
them until it was solved. In all cases, the problem was ultimately tracked
to a bad servo or a bad 5V power supply. Four cases were due to bad servos
and two cases were bad power supplies.

If you have finished your build and your Crowbox doesn't properly open and
close its reward lid, you may be experiencing this problem. Before you
begin to suspect that you have a bad power supply or servo, you should do
the following:

1) Double check your wiring using the wiring chart  (
http://thecrowbox.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=3Dkit:crowbox_wiring_cha=
rt.pdf)
just to make sure there isn't a simple wiring error.

2) Make sure that your 5V power supply is rated at least 2000mA and the
polarity is CENTER-POSITIVE. You can find both pieces of this information
printed on or molded into the wall-plug end of your power supply. If you
collected your 5V power adapter from somewhere around your house, these two
things may not be true, so it's worth verifying.

To determine the polarity of your power supply, look for the
CENTER-POSITIVE symbol on the wall plug:



If your power supply is rated under 2000mA or has the wrong polarity, this
is likely the source of problems for you.

If your power supply meets the proper requirements it may still be at fault
if your Crowbox acts funny. All six of the known cases of erratic Crowbox
behavior were ultimately caused by bad servos or bad power supplies. By
'bad' we mean faulty; even factory-fresh ones. We are seeing that bad
servos are more common than bad power supplies.

Another way you can troubleshoot this problem is by looking at the Arduino
Uno's pin 13 LED light as you operate your Crowbox. This light should
always be OFF unless you press the Training Phase Select button. If this
light is ON or BLINKS, you almost certainly have a bad servo. This clue can
help you focus your troubleshooting efforts on either the servo or the
power supply. A diagram I whipped up here shows where the Arduino's pin13
LED is located:

https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mXLPOLDg9ocL7DiAdTHLFRd1Xxpbh_5MxWeGi7q=
-W88/edit?usp=3Dsharing

The only effective way to do the actual troubleshooting is to try another
servo or power supply. This is obviously less of a headache if you happen
to have more than one of each of these components on-hand but a pain in the
neck if you don't. If you reach the point where you feel you need to buy
replacements for these two components, I would recommend trying servo
replacement first since this is the more common point of failure.

There are a lot of different manufacturers that produce the generic MG995
servo that the Crowbox uses. We have no information that would permit us to
say that a certain manufacturer is more or less reliable than other
manufacturers. We also don't have any information on vendors or ebay
sellers that seem to provide better quality MG995 servos. It's possible
that a servo bought from Amazon or from a local hobby store would be easier
to exchange than one bought on eBay, should you end up with a bad one.

Hopefully this information will help you narrow down the issue if you're
seeing erratic behavior from your Crowbox. We'll always help as much as we
can, so please get in touch here on the group if you need some help
figuring out how to go about solving this problem.
