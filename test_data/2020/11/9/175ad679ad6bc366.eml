Congratulations!! Very exciting stuff; I assume you've chatted with
Pinto.co?

I've been mostly focusing on IndigoMetrics.com, along with being on
retainer to a couple organizations for senior executives, advising

chatbot campaign.

What are your next steps, and what do you need to get there?
