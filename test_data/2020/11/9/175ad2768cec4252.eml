Do you have any suggestions on this role?

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2248120741/

I feel like I uniquely fit the bill on a lot of these requirements, but am
lacking experience on the HCLS side of launching/managing large projects as
well as depth in the AI/ML space - all stuff I'm comfortable picking up as
I go. I'm pretty sure that hitting "apply" on LInkedIn will just get me
circular filed - any suggestions on jumping the gap to getting a
conversation with HR?

Much obliged,
Josh
