J=C3=B6kull, thanks for the intro (to bcc.)

Star, pleasure to meet you. I'm an entrepreneur and former hacker (now
doing mostly business strategy) spending a lot of my time consulting to
senior execs of large multinationals. More saliently, I recently moved to
Iceland and am keen to connect with other expats and entrepreneurs! Would
you be game for a short call in the next couple weeks to compare notes?

All best,
Josh
