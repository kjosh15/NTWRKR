Hi Josh,

Last week at the Summit, we had a great conversation with Will Page, Former
Chief Economist of Spotify. Will was kind of enough to provide answers to
several of the questions from the Zoom chat that we were unable to address
live. See below for some follow-up thoughts - along with an article he
mentioned about reaching "peak streaming subscriptions". We will also be
sending you a copy of his upcoming book, *Tarzan Economics Eight Principles
for Pivoting through Disruption
<https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/books/Tarzan-Economics/Will-Page/97814=
71190926#:~:text=3DAbout%20The%20Book&text=3DWill%20Page%2C%20Spotify's%20f=
irst%20chief,Tupperware%20and%20even%20Groucho%20Marx.>
*when
it is released.

-Mike

*Q&A from Will Page*
*How did you make sure people think long and see the signals to innovate
toward the future?*
*In the case of music, what was clear (to me) was there was no turning
back. Those who were hesitant about letting go of downloads and CDs and
were worried about adopting streaming needed to know the consumer was
letting go of those CDs and downloads regardless. A key piece of work I did
was to show how iTunes went into decline in Canada in late-2013, just like
they did everywhere else. The catch? At the time, there was no Spotify or
streaming in Canada to blame - the 'usual suspects' were not there. Once I
showed the industry that, there was no rear mirror anymore. It was the A/B
experiment that gave us the signal we needed.*

*How would you decide what data combinations you=E2=80=99d prioritize?*
*A great question. With so much data, you risk the fog of 'big data'. What
you need is 'notable data'. In the early days of SPOT, we would look at the
willingness to use features (create and share a playlist) with stickiness
and churn (more likely to stay, less likely to leave).More recently, the
Spotufy Wrapped campaign provided a host of combinations of data analysis -
namely when listeners shared their end of year listening report with social
media, did that result in viral growth and new customer acquisition. I've
always said 'consumers are the new broadcasters'- trust me it's true.*

*What is Spotify doing to disrupt itself?*
*Podcasts are a good example as it introduces internal competition for
attention. If I listen to audio content for two-hours a day, then that's a
constraint - and within it you have displacement. If one of those hours is
a podcast, then that's one less hour for music. I think a better example is
the Apple One bundle (which launches tomorrow). It's an incredibly generous
set of features for $30 a month. Now, for the costly engineering and
product teams in Cupertino, they have a great resource allocation tool as
they can watch which features of the bundle get traction and then disrupt
themselves based on the signals they receive. Apple is about devices today,
it may well be fitness tomorrow.*

*Did you use any social influencers for any artists?* *Or for building your
business?*
*Music is social, it's the alchemy in the room so when consumers enjoy -
they share (and influence) what they are listening to. Similarly, when
artists have success, they talk about the route of that success. So both
sides of the market were self-reinforcing their support for Spotify without
the need for social influencers. If we go back to Wrapped, people were
sharing what was unshareable - nobody had the same taste, everyone was
unique so there was no 'broadcast' to share. This told me that the brand
became bigger than the band(s). Barack Obama was a social influencer when
he joked/asked about a job at Spotify, and the company went further and
posted a role on the jobs board called President of Playlists! (The role is
still vacant)*

*It seems like most artists today would love to live stream concerts from
their homes. Any reason why Spotify didn't connect the dots?*
*That's puzzling. Note I've been working full time on the book for the past
year so a little out of touch, but it does feel like there's a party going
on (live streaming) and neither Amazon Music, Apple Music or Spotify are
invited. Facebook has got increasingly involved with their portal and
YouTube is stepping up shortly but there's a lot of start-up activity here
and I'll name check a few: DICE.fm (ticketing focus); Moment House (one to
watch); and Maestro Live Stream which Billie Eilish partnered with a few
weeks ago. These start-ups are agile and Covid-19 has accelerated their
prospects. When live music finally returns, live streaming will not be
going away. It's a positive dilemma and a microcosm for many of the
industries represented by today's audience at World50. *
