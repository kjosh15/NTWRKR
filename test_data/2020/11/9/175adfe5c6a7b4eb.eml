Been making some new friends around Iceland, and am super curious about
Kria (the big gov't funded innovation matching fund). Looks like our Prime
Minister is very keen on the 4th industrial revolution (specifically in
communications and how AI is influencing us) and that could influence the
role of design nationally.

Do you have a view on either Kria or the AI advisory board? I'd like to
find a way to help with either!

Otherwise let me know how things are going as you settle into your new
role. Very keen to see what we could build here!

All best,
Josh
