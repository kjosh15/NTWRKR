Claudia,

You were recommended to me by Julie Shea of Shea Moving. We have a friend
packing up our one-bedroom apartment into cardboard boxes (no furniture)
and want to ship it to our new home in Iceland. Can you help us figure out
what sort of costs would be involved and what the logistics would look like=
?

Many thanks,
Josh
