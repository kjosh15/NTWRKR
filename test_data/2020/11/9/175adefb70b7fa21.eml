Am listening to Terry McGuire, Founding Partner at Polaris Partners
(speaking about investing in Iceland) who is saying he backs teams; a group
of people around an idea. They look for an indication that they have
traction in at least one market and can aim internationally.

So yes, the pending hires are important. I've already reached out to a
couple devs, a couple folks about what devs to hire, and a couple UX folks
who can help shape what we're looking for.
