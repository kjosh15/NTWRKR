Thanks for the update! Really like DXW - please do keep me on the list in
case you need tech/innovation strategy aimed at C-suite types.

Otherwise, what kind of work are you doing there? I'd had it on my list for
a while to reconnect as since Covid Indigo has found itself growing fast
and being faced with some big questions about what to do with our data and
key features. The biggest immediate challenge has been D&I, as the core of
the IP is bias detection, but equity across the map is something we're very
keen to bake into the core of the platform as we grow.

We've just onboarded our second large multinational, with four more in the
pipeline, and are at a point where we will need to hire some tech leads to
help us make decisions about data structure, privacy implications, and
feature development. I recall being impressed with your perspectives on
same when we spoke last and so you were top of mind.

Let me know if you'd be game to weigh in and compare notes!

All best wishes from snowy Iceland,
Josh
