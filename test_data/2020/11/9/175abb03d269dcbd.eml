Hi Josh,
Thanks for following up, and sorry for the slow response! Sure, I'm game to
chat about what you and I have been up to, and what's next: when is good
for you? I'm free Mon, Weds, or Thurs 5:30 - 7 PST. I could possibly make
some earlier times if you're in a later time zone -- let me know!

Best,
George
