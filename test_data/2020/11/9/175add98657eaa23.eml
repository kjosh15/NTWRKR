I love this except for slides #2 and #5.

Our "deep dive" will be our evidence of success, as statistically
demonstrated. IMHO.

I think you're right that we need to focus more on what makes a metric both
acceptable and useful for the individual and the collective, because that
becomes our core example of success - our leading functional metric (the
"eyeballs" equivalent in Google Analytics.)

Getting an investor's head around all this quickly is going to be key to
how we win funding/strategic. That's the insight we lead on. I.e.,

"We realized there was no single metric companies could use to manage their
culture. Once we'd found it, it was clear there were nearly infinite ways
to extend it and integrate data to make it more powerful, but firstly we
proved it works. Here's data that substantiates that:

A.
B.
C.

Now all we have to do is the work of extending it and creating tie-ins to
all the industry standard data sources so it's EVEN MORE powerful."


Put another way, we're already being successful. But we're being successful
because the very first little bit of our insight was tested. Now we want to
build on that evidence to completely transform the entire world of work.
(Read: 10x ROI.)

That's my take, anyway. You buy it?
