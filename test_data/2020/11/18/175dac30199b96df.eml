I'm due to speak to him tonight so will ask how he sees the platform; if =

As for being more transactional in how you treat people, I'm fine =
leaving the system biased towards treating people based on values as =
IMHO it's a more sustainable and broadly applicable measure.

=E2=80=93 maybe too skewed.

Still a low confidence level as not many reviews are in =E2=80=93 but =

=E2=80=93 possibly a part of the same transactional approach.
