Just spoke to the founder of this company. They use video clips from movies
as a way of helping people articulate their values. They've got a D&I and
an Emotional Intelligence curriculum and are lacking in a way to both
re-engage with customers and to provide metrics on success.

I've sent him our sandbox and we can schedule another call if you think
it's worth trying out - how hard is it to program in their content?
