I'm due to speak to him tonight so will ask how he sees the platform; if
he's happy to wait and see then let's. Likewise, if he feels it's not a
good fit for BSS then we don't have to worry going forward.

As for being more transactional in how you treat people, I'm fine leaving
the system biased towards treating people based on values as IMHO it's a
more sustainable and broadly applicable measure.
