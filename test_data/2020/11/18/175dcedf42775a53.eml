Had a good conversation with Michael just now. Started out the convo asking
about business and he confessed he was trying to figure out how to break
out of doing standard ad agency work and really wanting to get into the
kind of strategic consulting work we'd talked about originally around this
time last year.

When we shifted to Indigo, he was explicitly aware that he was ranked very
low "because I'm the boss, and that's fine." We talked around how BSS was
very different than our other clients, but in fact more emblematic of the
kind of cultures we were looking to support companies in building. He was
clear that the platform as it stands now "isn't right for us" and made some
suggestions around making it less stat heavy; he had a good quote that
"you'll know you're succeeding when you can turn off the stats."

We then turned the conversation to where we could go next, and I reminded
him that we had started the partnership hoping that BSS could sell a
version of Indigo with their values leading; he really liked this, but
pointed out that they'd want to make something that was proscriptive and
possibly less data heavy. As we talked he got more excited and started
thinking about a psychologist friend who had an entire empathy framework
that might work really well and could be "BSS branded" as a means to get
them into the kind of corporate culture transformation they really wanted
to be doing - something that assesses "the ideal things you need to be for
success."

I was very bullish on this and was clear that we wanted to partner with BSS
in leveraging the platform to sell their secret sauce, and that this might
be a great way to create an ideal diagnostic tool for them to help break
into that market. He was really excited.

And that's where we left it. Overall it feels like a very positive
direction for BSS to head in that it gives them ownership of their version
of the platform to sell and brings in a new content framework to test. I'll
loop back around later this week to see about next steps - let me know if
you have any feedback in the meantime.
