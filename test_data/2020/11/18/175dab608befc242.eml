Fyi my algos are struggling with Michael L at BSS - he got some good reviews
this week that has bumped his score well up. I need to do some more analysis
but we are seeing more dispersion on views about him than I think I have
seen before. I am curious to see what happens when the algo goes back to
those people that have canned him before to ask them another question
(should happen in the next few weeks) - will they ding him again or back
off? Generally our iterative question approach struggles in instances such
as this.

I am thinking that maybe he is transactional in his relationships and I need
to look at some sort of consistency measure to surface back to individuals
as a part of their feedback - because some people are quite happy to be
transactional. Any thoughts? Our approach is skewed to favour those that
treat everyone the same - ie they adopt a values based approach to
relationships, not transactional - maybe too skewed.

Still a low confidence level as not many reviews are in - but the gender
bias algos are also starting to flash in relation to him - possibly a part
of the same transactional approach.
