Hi Josh,

Thanks for the chat yesterday!

I=E2=80=99m excited to expand C-Side with a much fuller treatment, which =
will certainly be worth it in the end.

But before I reopen the project next week, is it possible to make =
certain that GPT-3 can be used in the way we=E2=80=99ve been discussing? =
Meaning, would it be possible to mock up a dialog box and get GPT-3 up =
and running around a single hotly debated item?

It=E2=80=99d be such a great proof of concept to go along with the =
treatment, even if quite limited.

Curious to hear your thoughts and thanks!

Matt
