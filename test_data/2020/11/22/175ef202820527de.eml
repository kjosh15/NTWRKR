Hulda,

There's a bunch of items on the Ship When Finished list that aren't
resolved; can you explain for each of these?

bedside shelf "really?"
DUPLO blocks "can go into storage, want to own for future" storage where?
Mattresses from the bunk bed (getting rid of the bunk bed itself) "really?"
ottoman, it folds flat "really?"
Tripp Trapp chairs "really?"
tools, everything that's in the tool cabinet "really?"
cordless vacuum dyson and parts "really?"

In Ship Now you listed as really wanting the "high chair black that
attaches to table" - can you help me understand why? It doesn't work for
either of our kids.

Thanks!

xoxo,
Josh
