Birgir Magn=C3=BAsson recommended I get in touch with you. I'm a US + Icela=
ndic
citizen, recently moved with my family to Iceland (started establishing
residency June 16th). I'm currently negotiating a contract for 2021 and
need a price estimate and advice on:

- Filing Icelandic Taxes (both for 2020 and going forward)
- Filing US taxes as a US + Icelandic citizen while residing in Iceland in
2021
- Setting up an Icelandic LLC for operation in 2021
- Icelandic LLC payroll/accounting/bookkeeping ongoing

Can you help?

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
