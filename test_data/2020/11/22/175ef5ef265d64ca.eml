I hope you and yours are doing well! Can you give me an estimate on what
you'd charge to help me set up an Icelandic LLC? I'm getting closer to
closing a contract and will need the LLC for 2021 when/if I do.

All best wishes to everyone - here's hoping we get vaccines soon; would be
great to see you all again!

best wishes,
Josh
