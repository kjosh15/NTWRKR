If we make less than $103k we can file taxes on it in Iceland and via the
double taxation treaty write off the us taxes. Can she manage that
paperwork? (See greenback for idea of what that looks like.)

Otherwise we=E2=80=99ll claim we made no $$ to Iceland, file as normal in N=
YC, and
then switch to fully Icelandic in 2021.
