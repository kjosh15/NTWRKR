This all sounds right, but I think they're still more similar than
dissimilar. I.e., an investor wants to see massive growth in as short a
time as possible. We provide a roadmap for that, and offer the same thing
to a strategic except that a lot of the growth prerequisites are already
filled, meaning you can get to the Really Cool Stuff (TM) faster.

Otherwise the only thing I wonder about is the idea of a centralized
repository/MarkIt structure. Think we may still find ourselves seeing
breakout success in the US throughout whitelabeled partners, in which case
you get regular old market-leading growth. No?
