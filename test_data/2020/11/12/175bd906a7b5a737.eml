So good talking with you today; I'd missed your insight, and really
appreciate your candor about the last oh, decade or so! I get the feeling
that with a pint and some time we could have carried on for hours. Turns
out you can pack a lot into a decade!

Let me know when you're keen for a followup, and in the meantime I'd love
to talk to Jeremy and Tom. A big part of what I did for IDEO was to help
them figure out what their purpose meant for their technology. I'd be
curious to see what we could make of the reverse for Ripjar.

All best,
Josh
