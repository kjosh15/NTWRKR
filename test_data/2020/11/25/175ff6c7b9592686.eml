&gt; Thanks so much for the conversation! It was massively helpful and I&#3=
9;m excited to talk to Tabby; it sounds like WhatIf is in an interesting pl=
ace with a really powerful set of new capabilities at hand.

&gt; It has all the bells and whistles turned on so it&#39;s a bit crowded =
(normally you&#39;d pick and choose features depending on what campaigns yo=
u&#39;re running), but it&#39;s the best way to get an overview of the kind=
s of data the platform can collect and provide. Let
 me know if you have any questions I can answer for you prior to your month=
ly meeting!<br>

&gt; Dr. Epstein of AIBRT recently sent out some grant info and I noticed y=
ou were included; I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;ve been working with him but=
 was hoping you could tell me about WhatIf. I&#39;ve been stalking them onl=
ine for a while now and would love to know more
 - are you enjoying working with them, and do you recommend them for techno=
logy transformation/strategy work?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Apologies for the cold outreach, and very much obliged!<br>
