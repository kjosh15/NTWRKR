I'd say we should only do gifts for the kids, and only if you really want
to. We might send cards or a little something, but nothing big or expensive
- we're all in lockdown this year!! Does that sound right to you?

As for our address, we're at:

Vi=C3=B0ifell
607 Akureyri
Iceland

xoxo,
Josh
