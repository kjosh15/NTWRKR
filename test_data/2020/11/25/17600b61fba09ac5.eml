Hey dude, good to hear from you.

Dani and I are doing mostly normal stuff now that we're settled. We got a
new dog, a German Shepherd named Eli, to help us with security around the
house and the property. He's a trained dog so it's pretty cool. He's very
protective which is also awesome. I had an exhaust vent installed in my
shop for my laser cutter and had an extra duct installed so that I can get
up a spray paint booth later. Too cold for that shit now! I have a
hydroponics tent out there now with a small heater in it to keep the laser
tube from freezing this winter. The tent accepts ducting so it'll be easy
to get the laser hooked up the rest of the way and running.

Bought a UTV (A Polaris Ranger XP 1000 Northstar Ultimate) (mouthful) and a
plow attachment, so I can keep our 1/4 mile long driveway plowed this
winter. That will be interesting. Eli gets in with me and rides in the
passenger seat looking out the windshield just like a person. It's funny.
It's a half-mile to the mailbox so I usually drive the UTV down there.

So, about Jeremy. He's making incremental changes to a design that I think
needs an overhaul. I still feel strongly that we need to do these things:

-Redesign for more conventional materials. I want to design a housing that
can be built with low-cost softwood lumber in sizes that can be purchased
at Home Depot and Lowe's, and can be cut to size by staff right there in
the store so that the builder leaves with materials that are already
cut-to-size. User will still have to drill holes but otherwise I'd like to
not require them to own some kind of power saw.

-Relegate Acrylic parts to machinery only. Acrylic machine guts installed
inside a wooden box.

-Redesign the lid-perch system to eliminate water incursion.

-Strongly consider eliminating the servo and replacing it with a simple DC
motor. I'm very concerned about the failure rate on the low-cost servos we
rely on, and I don't think the answer is asking people to buy a $25-$30
servo instead of a $6 one, when we could just design for a $5 DC gearmotor.

-Reduce the parts/tools count. There are some oddball items that users have
to buy (silicone chef rubber bands, metal hitch pins) that increase the
cost and procurement times for parts. Where possible, I'd like to eliminate
these or replace them with items that can be bought at Home Depot, Lowes,
or (gag) Wal-Mart. Most of the US population has easy access to one or all
of these outlets.

So it's a little weird to have someone making incremental changes without
our history of knowledge about the compromises we had to make, and the
existing known flaws in the physical build. It's not a good sign that he
didn't open a dialog about potential changes before deciding what he
thought should change. That's a bit hostile, even if not malicious in
intent.

If he does unleash his own version of the Crowbox, we will incur any
support issues rising out of his design changes. How will users know which
Crowbox they're building? Our build videos aren't going to be valid for his
modified parts, and if someone starts out building a Crowbox from our
instructional videos but using his parts, they may end up chemically
welding their parts into useless subassemblies. So what level and quality
of instruction and support is he prepared to offer for users who want to
build his version?

I'm very concerned about how we'd tag and identify his modified Crowbox,
for the sake of users who are trying to find build instructions, operating
instructions, or technical support.

I don't have any problem with Jeremy branching the Github repository but
it's not super clear to me what he'd be changing in the software. I assumed
that any modifications to the software would involve the addition of
cameras or other types of sensors, or wifi communication. We would need to
review his code submissions to make sure he doesn't adversely affect the
performance or stability of the software.

Over my career I had the opportunity to work with and learn from very
capable professionals who possessed the exceedingly rare ability to be
utterly objective about their own work and its viability. This is less
common among hobbyists and hackers, where building or programming something
to your own satisfaction is NOT the same as building something that will
then be turned over to the public for use. I don't know where on the
Hobbyist<->Objective Professional spectrum this guy falls but to begin
with, I'll assume way towards Hobbyist. This is a space in which I don't
give anyone benefit of the doubt- I have to be convinced otherwise. But
we'd learn a lot about him by looking over his parts and his changes to the
software.

By the way, Jeremy has a point when it comes to the water-thin #3 formula
of Sci-Grip solvent. In fact, I use the water thin formula for all of my
personal projects and most of the Crowbox prototyping. Application is more
precise and this formula chemically welds the parts together much more
quickly. However, this stuff evaporates incredibly quickly- you can watch a
large puddle of it disappear in front of you- it takes seconds. Or you can
watch your entire $30 can of it evaporate in minutes if you forget to cap
it. Also, it must be applied with a syringe and precision applicator tip or
a special plastic squeeze bottle with precision applicator tip. So there
are some materials-handling concerns with this formula as well as special
equipment required. The other thing he doesn't know about our experience
with the Crowbox is that our recommended syrup-consistency #16 Sci-Grip
solvent is that it is partially thickened with dissolved plastic. This
means that the thicker formula adds body in addition to welding parts
together- it deposits liquid plastic into the joints, which cures to
plastic. This is very helpful in making sure that [less experienced
builders] get the benefit of the gap-filling feature of the thicker solvent
formula. This helps make sure they don't end up with dry/partial joints or
gaps in parts that really need a seal. The #16 formula is far more
forgiving and the #3 formula requires some skill to properly apply and
inspection of the finished joints to ensure the weld is complete.

On a Crowbox which features a wood housing, I probably wouldn't have a
problem asking users to use the more complicated #3 solvent on the internal
machine parts. It'd be cleaner and, inside the machine, less critical to
ensure joints are absolutely complete.

I have no argument against a modular design which can be field-stripped for
cleaning, repair, or possibly even upgrading. It's something we did not
design into this version of the Crowbox but the benefits are obvious.

Again, no trouble letting him branch the GitHub repository. It's public
anyway so we are not set up to stop that, by design. But I really want to
figure out how we avoid confusing users or running into trouble with his
version-and-a-half released on the group.

At a high level, I'm feeling more like we need to pursue success on our own
again. I want to build and operate a Crowbox that functions all the way to
Phase Four, including the compliment of participating Crows. I see crows
every couple of days here but they just fly overhead. I bet I could start
convincing them to land. We're out in the country on 10 acres, with 5 acres
of hay and tall Fescue, so we have lots of wild rodents. I need to figure
out a strategy (likely just an elevated platform) where I could provide
peanuts to the crows without feeding the field mice, too. I also need to
make sure I can set up my site in a way that our various neighbors' roaming
barn cats can't assault the crows. See, guys who are building contraptions
out of ugly discarded fence wood or store-bought plastic Rubbermaid
containers are making good progress while we branched to design something
than anyone could build and operate. It feels a bit like the community
wants to see the success on YouTube more than they want to participate in
achieving the success so we may want to seriously consider a parallel
project where we design and build whatever we need to continue our own
research, while continuing to support the community and their
easier-to-build-and-maintain current version of the Crowbox.

My attention is pretty divided right now, so apologies. This is a very raw
data dump on you and I think I wandered a bit. It'd be good to make another
attempt to sync up via webchat so that I don't have this huge backlog of
thoughts and information that I keep trying to express every time we're
discussing some other aspect of the project.

-Steve
