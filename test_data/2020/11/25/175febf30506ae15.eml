Thanks for the article - definitely interesting, but I'm going to ask we
push off the intro until the new year as it's clearly a feature for later
development - there's a lot to dig into here!!

The Northern lights here are indeed amazing; my eldest son calls them night
rainbows. Unfortunately they're nearly impossible to capture without a
special slow-exposure camera. You can google "Icelandic Northern Lights"
and the images you find will generally reflect the reality - you ought to
come visit some time!!

I'll send you our materials when they're neatly assembled, and thanks again
for the call. Looking forward to staying in touch.

All best,
Josh
