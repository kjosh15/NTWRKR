Konrad,

It looks like DMARC when run through GMail needs to have a policy flag set.
Can you update the record as per below?

_dmarc.josh.is. 300 IN TXT v=3DDMARC1; p=3Dquarentine; rua=3Dmailto:
dmarc-reports@josh.is


To soften the bow I found this (admittedly very weird) cyberpunk video
which contains Russian. Then I realized it's actually mocking Russia, which
may not be appreciated. If not, please let me know.

Separately, my son has recently decided that he hates the kindle and is
refusing to read anything on it, including your book. This is liable to
change any minute - I'll keep you posted. On a positive note, my attempts
to bribe him in exchange for doing so are turning out to be useless, so
it's likely he'll be as financially successful later in life as his old
man.

All best wishes from snowy Iceland,
Josh
