Most of the time. But again, I paid for the product with the expectation

more complex and take more time to diagnose and fix. We&#39;re working clos=

 unfair to pay for something when it isn&#39;t working as expected=E2=80=94=
I get that. <span>We believe very deeply that YNAB is worth the cost <em>wi=
thout</em> direct import, though. With that said, if those other transactio=
n entry options are not satisfactory to you, I understand that as well. Giv=
en the imperfect nature of transaction aggregation, it might mean that YNAB=
 just isn&#39;t the best option for you. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d be=
 happy to cancel your subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br><br>If =
you do choose to hang in there with us, given the holiday season, we won&#3=

 any news! <br><br>Let me know if you have any questions at all, I&#39;d be=
