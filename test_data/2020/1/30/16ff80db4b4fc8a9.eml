 working closely with them to get a fix for you as quickly as possible.=

 worth the cost <em>without</em> direct import, though. With that said,=
 if those other transaction entry options are not satisfactory to you, I=
 understand that as well. Given the imperfect nature of transaction aggr=
egation, it might mean that YNAB just isn't the best option for you. If=
 that's the case, I'd be happy to cancel your subscription and issue a p=
ro-rated refund.<br /><br />If you do choose to hang in there with us, g=
