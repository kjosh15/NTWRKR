 out. =F0=9F=91=8B There's no official word yet, but our import partner=
 is still actively working on this problem!<br /><br />As for freezing y=
our account, that's not an option we provide because we <em>truly </em>b=
elieve YNAB is worth the money, even without Direct Import. We offer <a=
 href=3D"https://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/32-recording-spending-a=
dding-transactions">other features</a>, like the mobile apps and <a href=
=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/173-file-based-import">File-B=
ased Importing</a>, that make YNAB completely functional and easy to use=
 even if import isn't currently available. This is also why we don't alt=
er the cost for folks whose banks aren't supported at all.<br /><br />I=
 hope you can understand where we're coming from there. <span>Since I ca=
n see you've been communicating with us about Capital One for <em>awhile=
</em>, I've added on a free month to your subscription as a more tangibl=
e apology. I know it doesn't replace a completely smooth Direct Import e=
xperience, but I hope it helps a little. You're now set until <strong>Ju=
ne 21, 2020.</strong><br /><br />And as Kait mentioned before, if YNAB i=
s no longer the best budgeting option for you, we'd be happy to cancel y=
our subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br /><br />Let me know wh=
at you think and if you have any questions on this, I'm happy to go over=
 it more with you. :)</span><br /></div><br>=0A        <br>--<br><table=

rtner is working hard on this issue, but they don't have a resolution qu=

 are more complex and take more time to diagnose and fix. We're working=
 closely with them to get a fix for you as quickly as possible.  <br /><=
br />I completely understand where you're coming from though. It <em>doe=
s</em> feel unfair to pay for something when it isn't working as expecte=
d=E2=80=94I get that. <span>We believe very deeply that YNAB is worth th=
e cost <em>without</em> direct import, though. With that said, if those=
 other transaction entry options are not satisfactory to you, I understa=
nd that as well. Given the imperfect nature of transaction aggregation,=
 it might mean that YNAB just isn't the best option for you. If that's t=
he case, I'd be happy to cancel your subscription and issue a pro-rated=
 refund.<br /><br />If you do choose to hang in there with us, given the=
 holiday season, we won't be sending regular updates, but we <em>will</e=
m> reach out when we hear any news! <br /><br />Let me know if you have=
 any questions at all, I'd be happy to go over this more with you.</span=
