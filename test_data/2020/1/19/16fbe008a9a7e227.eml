Hey y'all-

 Grace was AWESOME. We came home and they were jamming out on uke and a
synth beat from Ori's chrome book. They made snacks, did some sewing and
played games. The kids didn't want her to go, and the gold standard- JONI
wanted her to stay and keep playing (she's never that easy!) So, 5 stars
from our end.

I asked her about a doing a practice pick up, so it feels clear and easy. I
am have a late rehearsal this Friday, so won't be there, so I've asked her
if she she could show up at 245pm, and Josh- would you be able to meet her
in the lobby and show her the pick-up ropes? Then she can take Ori to
parkour. Shelley will take Joni to gymnastics.
*I just asked her via email, so not sure if she's able to make it yet but I
like the idea of one of us showing her around Ella baker etc.*

Its Sunday!! and no school tmrw! woop woop!!
