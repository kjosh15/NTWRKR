Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and ful=
ly close the windows that were left slightly open? Or do you leave the wind=
ows for the fresh air?<br>
<br>
Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done =
right for you!<br>
<br>
Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
