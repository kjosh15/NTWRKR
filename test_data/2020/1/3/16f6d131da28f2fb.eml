so the cats don't get totally crazy.

The cats are just adorable=E2=80=A6 They played for a little bit but are no=

Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and ful=

ows for the fresh air?<br>

Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done =
right for you!<br>

Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
