Thanks again for taking such great care of the place; you left it spotless,
the cats looked super happy, and it was a little bit of heaven to come home
to a glass of wine and clean sheets to collapse into. You guys are the
best!!! Let us know if you ever want to visit again - we travel a couple
times of year and would love to have you back!

Thanks again and happy happy new year,
Josh
