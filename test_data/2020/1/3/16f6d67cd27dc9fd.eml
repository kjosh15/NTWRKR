A couple notes:

- There were only two "Joe B" images, numbered 1 and 11. I used Joeb11 as
Joe2.
- The text for Adolfo was incomplete. I edited as best I could, but please
review.
- There is still no text for Ruslana or Joe S.

Otherwise everything is updated as requested. Let me know about the above
issues and I'll try to resolve ASAP.

best,
Josh
