Dude! You guys are the best!
I definitely woke up this morning (in a haze) thinking Rex was meowing for
food... was just a dream lol!

And If you do ever need cat sitters, just let us know!
With Zoe and Michaels incoming wee one, I want to be there as much as
possible for them... we really appreciate you saying that =3D)

PS: The laundry room door had an issue (as told by a neighbour) so it was
kept propped open during allotted times... so if you guys see it open, I'd
leave it open for now.

ALSO - We TOTALLY forgot our shower loofas... sorry about that my man!

- Dave

 Rex has been making little meow sounds while he sleeps the past couple nig=
hts... his mouth is closed when it happens so I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s a s=
leep... And he&#39;s also been a little more vocal the past couple mornings=
 (it&#39;s the kind of meow they do when calling out for you to play with t=
hem or for food at their feeding times)<div><div>Just wondering if these ar=
e normal things he does?</div></div><div><br></div><div>We ran out of the g=
reenies the other day and gave them the other treat that was next to the gr=
eenies... just wondering if we should stop and buy more greenies?... I&#39;=

The cats are just adorable=E2=80=A6 They played for a little bit but are no=

<br>
Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and ful=

ows for the fresh air?<br>
<br>
Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done =

Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
