Amazing, thank you so much!

Separately, I'd love to talk to your buddy at Amex sometime - the Black
Card group seems like a super interesting customer base to examine. I've
done some work with World 50 (another exclusive, high-end client group)
around how to prespecify breakout services, and would love to compare notes=
!

Many many thanks,
Josh
