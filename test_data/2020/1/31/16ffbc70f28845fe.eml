Replying to your comments below - I don't have a firm view - lets discuss -
but the one thing I am focussed on is driving practical projects that will
get us data and $ within 6  months from SXSW - not just more navel gazing
chat.

 

So I worry that without the slide 13 proscriptive solution we remain stuck
in navel gazing territory.

 

Maybe one way to look at it is who do we hope to reach in the audience and
what do we hope that they do?

 

*	Corporates that could use Indigo
We hope that the decision maker in the audience gets the impression that we
are guys at the forefront of developments that are not just talking but
actually have a practical solution that I could try
*	Organisations that are interested in behaviour change in a wider
context, so Indigo plus targeted digital, or targeted digital in its own
Again we are trying to give them the feel that we are at the forefront and
that we have some amazing tech that we are moving forward with and they
should jump on board by paying us $200k to also develop with them

 

I worry that the bit about "share learning and bootstrap variety of efforts"
is an invitation to chat - not an invitation to do business together.

 

I realise we need to subtle because it is SXSW - but think we really need to
get the message across that we aren't talkers - we are moving forward with
practical solutions - jump on board or else we and the world will disappear
into the distance.....

 

I was wondering if we could run a clip from black mirror and explain how the
reality will be close but different - but maybe that only works if you have
seen the original black mirror episode and had a think about it.

Or possibly some narrative about what the future will look like - I have
been really quite interested in how those action statement reports we have
now encapsulate a person - so we could talk about what the future will be
like when there is no anonymity and we can map / create a digital twin of
each individual's behaviours. This allows us to say that we can already
create a digital twin of the individual's conduct in the workplace - without
explicitly selling it. We could then focus a bit more on the pathways that
we will need to build together to help people use the data to navigate life
- creating this narrative that "we are the metrics experts - now we need to
find people management experts to collaborate with - because behaviour
change needs both metrics and people experts". Think that is where I come
out - think I would like to be more specific as to the type of partner we
are looking for - not just "lets collaborate". 

 

 

C

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I took your outline and mapped it to a deck so we could look at what the
narrative "beats" would be, and thereby find where we ned more detail,
examples, engagement, etc.

From what I put together I have a bunch of questions, but the big one is
about slide 13: do we really want to propose this as a diagnostic or
proscriptive solution for modern social ills? Or are we more keen to explore
what we built as a potentially viable alternative to a prevailing (and
oligarchical) technicology trend?

I'd suggest that if we instead charactarize the "East vs West" conundrum as
being equally unsavory (one through overcontrol, one through undercontrol)
we can explore what we've done with Indigo as being a significantly advanced
third category from which we are happy to share learnings and thus bootstrap
a variety of efforts (and/or find partners). Again, if our goal is to find
partners and or customers, this might be more useful.

Thoughts?
- J
