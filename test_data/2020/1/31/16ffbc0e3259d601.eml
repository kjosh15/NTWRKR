Ditto on capitalizing on previous connections!!

While I'm waiting to hear from your Biz Dev guy I have a super odd request.
My presskit needs to have "2019" changed to "2020" in two places, and it's
only editable in InDesign. The person that built it wants a full project
fee to make the edits. Is there any way I can borrow your software or pay
you a more reasonable fee to make the fix? I'm sending it out a bunch as
follow up to my recent TV interview and need to get it tweaked stat.

And before you ask, yes I looked into pirating it but doing so requires a
bunch of dubious tweaks to core functions I'd rather not make. Adobe has
stepped up their game, it seems!
