Wanted to update you guys:

1) W50 NY Lunches: format + pilot.

I'm waiting for a more formal offer from IDEO about their lunch series, but
expect it'll include something like a creative dive into prototyping, a
cross-disciplinary workshop, or a tensions session to reveal group insight.
Have you heard anything from members who might be in NYC Q1 2020?

2) Smart Cities:

Turns out this is a really hot topic and I know a bunch of experts in the
field. There are a load of different facets to this, from data gathering to
legislation/regulation to company rollouts like scooters. Let me know if I
can help on this front!

3) W50 Persuasion Analytics:

Is there any interest in a working group? Happy to jump on the phone to
briefly touch on these or to brainstorm other opps if that's helpful.

Finally, I'd be enormously grateful if I could get in touch with those two
Accenture contacts - please let me know what I can do to help make that
happen!

All best,
- J
