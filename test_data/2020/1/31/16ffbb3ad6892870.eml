Principle Josh pointed out that there is another high school in the
building who have their own internet wiring. He's going to introduce me to
see if they're interested in the project. Do you mind holding on to the kit
in the meantime so I don't risk damage by schlepping it back and forth to
Queens? I hope to connect with them soon.

Let me know and a million thanks!
