ou can make the best choice for your budgeting situation.=0A=0AIf these=
 frequent reauthorizations are too burdensome and you decide=0Ato end yo=
ur subscription, I completely understand. But if you'd like=0Ato try out=
 some of our alternate transaction entry methods [1] that=0Awill help yo=

 I wanted to share my budgeting workflow in case it would=0Abe helpful f=
or you:=0A=0A=09* I've created SCHEDULED TRANSACTIONS [2] for recurring=
 or=0Apredictable transactions like my paycheck, rent, utilities,=0Ainsu=
rances, subscriptions like Netflix, etc. I set the date and=0Afrequency=
 of the transaction once and YNAB automatically enters them=0Aat those i=
ntervals for me.=0A=09* I use our MOBILE APP to record spending while I'=
m out. This one's=0Aalways been hard to remember for me, so I keep mysel=
f disciplined by=0Aentering a transaction as soon as a cashier hands me=
 the receipt,=0Abefore I put it in my wallet.=0A=09* FILE-BASED IMPORTIN=
G [3] fills in any gaps where I might've missed=0Aa transaction during t=
he week.=0A=09* I RECONCILE MY ACCOUNTS [4] at least once a week, which=
 ensures=0Athat their balances are 100% accurate and that no missing, in=
correct,=0Aduplicate, or uncleared transactions have slipped through the=
 cracks=0Ain the last few days.=0A=0AThat routine keeps me in my budget=
 about 5 MINUTES A DAY between my=0ACapital One and USAA accounts, _mayb=
e_ 10 minutes if I'm reconciling=0Aall four individual accounts at once.=
 With this method of=0Aactive-entry, your budget will be _more_ up to da=
te than if you rely=0Asolely on Capital One to import your transactions,=
 and will lead to=0Aheightened awareness and prioritization over your sp=
ending & saving.=0AIt's worked well for me, so I hope you'll give it a s=

 subscription, I completely understand. But if you'd like to try out som=
e of our <a href=3D"https://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/32-adding-tr=
ansactions">alternate transaction entry methods</a> that will help you a=
utomate your accounts while relying less on CapOne's connectivity, I wan=
ted to share my budgeting workflow in case it would be helpful for you:<=
br /><ol><li>I've created <a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/arti=
cle/165-scheduled-transactions"><strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong><=
/a> for recurring or predictable transactions like my paycheck, rent, ut=
ilities, insurances, subscriptions like Netflix, etc. I set the date and=
 frequency of the transaction once and YNAB automatically enters them at=
 those intervals for me.</li><li>I use our <strong>mobile app</strong> t=
o record spending while I'm out. This one's always been hard to remember=
 for me, so I keep myself disciplined by entering a transaction as soon=
 as a cashier hands me the receipt, before I put it in my wallet.</li><l=
i><a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/173-file-based-impor=
t"><strong>File-Based Importing</strong></a> fills in any gaps where I m=
ight've missed a transaction during the week.</li><li>I <strong><a href=
=3D"https://www.youneedabudget.com/video-courses/using-your-ynab-budget/=
lesson-3/unit-3/#course-player">reconcile my accounts</a> </strong>at le=
ast once a week, which ensures that their balances are 100% accurate and=
 that no missing, incorrect, duplicate, or uncleared transactions have s=
lipped through the cracks in the last few days.</li></ol><br />That rout=
ine keeps me in my budget about <strong>5 minutes a day</strong> between=
 my Capital One and USAA accounts, <em>maybe</em> 10 minutes if I'm reco=
nciling all four individual accounts at once. With this method of active=
-entry, your budget will be <em>more</em> up to date than if you rely so=
lely on Capital One to import your transactions, and will lead to height=
ened awareness and prioritization over your spending &amp; saving. It's=
 worked well for me, so I hope you'll give it a shot if you'd like to ke=
ep using YNAB and the YNAB Method. <br /><br />Let me know if you have a=
ny additional questions! <br /></div><br>=0A        <br>--<br><table cel=

t's expected that they'll prompt you to reauthorize your connection <em>=

ny announcements when they put these protocols in place, so I'm not very=
 hopeful that they'll announce when they might change again. As a custom=
er I wish they'd give us the option to control our <em>own</em> account=

 at this time. I've reached out to share my feedback with them, and I'd=

he cost for folks whose banks aren't supported at all.<br /><br />I hope=
 you can understand where we're coming from there. <span>Since I can see=
 you've been communicating with us about Capital One for <em>awhile</em>=
, I've added on a free month to your subscription as a more tangible apo=
logy. I know it doesn't replace a completely smooth Direct Import experi=

 longer the best budgeting option for you, we'd be happy to cancel your=
 subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br /><br />Let me know what=
