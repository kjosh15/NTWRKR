Let me know if you've got anything I can pass to W50 for the executive
lunch series pilot - even just a couple ideas around format (tensions
session, instant prototyping, cross-disciplinary examination, ??) would be
great. I'm going to ping my W50 contacts about what they've heard from
members in the meantime.

All best,
Josh
