 Seth mentioned; due to Capital One's security protocols (which we don't=
 have any influence over, and as a fellow CapOne customer...I really wis=
h we did =F0=9F=98=85) <strong>it's expected that they'll prompt you to=
 reauthorize your connection <em>every</em> day.</strong> But you don't=
 need to go through those prompts<strong> unless you're expecting new tr=
ansactions to import that time.</strong><br /><br />So if you spent a fe=
w minutes to <a href=3D"https://www.youneedabudget.com/video-courses/usi=
ng-your-ynab-budget/lesson-3/unit-3/#course-player">reconcile your accou=
nts</a> on Saturday night and know there won't be any new transactions t=
o import when you check your budget Sunday morning, you don't need to re=
authorize the connection that time. <br /><br />As for when this might c=
hange...Capital One didn't share any announcements when they put these p=
rotocols in place, so I'm not very hopeful that they'll announce when th=
ey might change again. As a customer I wish they'd give us the option to=
 control our <em>own</em> account security settings, but after digging i=
n that's not something they offer at this time. I've reached out to shar=
e my feedback with them, and I'd encourage you to do the same!<br /><br=
 />Let me know if I can be of assistance with anything else, Josh. I'll=
 be glad to help however I can.<br /></div><br>=0A        <br>--<br><tab=

n if import isn't currently available. This is also why we don't alter t=
he cost for folks whose banks aren't supported at all.<br /><br />I hope=
 you can understand where we're coming from there. <span>Since I can see=
 you've been communicating with us about Capital One for <em>awhile</em>=
, I've added on a free month to your subscription as a more tangible apo=

ence, but I hope it helps a little. You're now set until <strong>June 21=
, 2020.</strong><br /><br />And as Kait mentioned before, if YNAB is no=
 longer the best budgeting option for you, we'd be happy to cancel your=
 subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br /><br />Let me know what=
