Matt,

Really appreciate your taking the time yesterday; both videos you sent seem
spot on for where I think we could take this.

I'm attaching the deck TexasCrew and I developed. Here's some notes:

- Right now NatGeo and Discovery seem more amenable than ever to sponsored
content

- OTT content is having a boom year in documentary

- Most countries are keen to get exposure around their internal technology
and innovation efforts

- Most large multinational tech companies stand to benefit from increasing
their deal flow and visibility outside the US to tech startups

- Said corporations need to balance this access (internationally) with
their media spend and resulting coverage (nationally)

- I've had a series of very good conversations with Shane Wall at HP. His
CMO liked the idea but wanted to see if be "further along" (i.e., with a
commitment from a channel so they could evaluate the media spend for value)
and then then got a new CEO.

- One open question is if Amazon, Hulu, or Netflix would be interested in
this and if so what would make it most compelling to them to help draw in
the corporate side.

- I've got access to a significant number of C-Suite executives at very
large corporations to pitch this idea to.

- I *did* have access to the WEF, but their head of media (my contact
there) just stepped down. He can probably introduce me to his replacement,
but this would now be delayed.

Obviously this leaves lots of open questions, but also lots of pretty good
pieces we could put together. So far, pitching this directly to
corporations has been slow: their CMOs want exact #'s on viewers and are
looking for media value, and their CTOs are playing outside their field
although they (typically) love the idea of getting access to foreign
markets and sources of innovation.

Let me know what you think!
- J
