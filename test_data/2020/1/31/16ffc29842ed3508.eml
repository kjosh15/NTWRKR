Cool... I know you a ton of responses.

1) Ashley has been pinging EAs of out-of-town members about it. We'll keep
you posted.

2) Malik (from our product team) are connecting with your guy to talk smart
cities.

3) Accenture contacts. I tried with both and the response I got from my
peers in the other groups was basically "good luck, they don't respond"
they did say they would mention when they see them next?

4) The persuasion analytics working group is not quite ready for us to
pursue but I say we start with something at a Summit or even tying into the
lunches to test the waters.
