August check; let me know when you=E2=80=99ve heard more on July!!

TV hosting is an absolute blast, but yeah it seems to be mostly taking
specialists in one area and seeing if they can manage to not look like
idiots in front of a camera. Plus, the pay rates have tanked in the last
few years due to OTT content providers like Netflix taking over. Definitely
not glamorous, but still fun!!
