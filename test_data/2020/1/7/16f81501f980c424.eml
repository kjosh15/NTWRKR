Long time no speak! Do you have time in the next couple weeks to 1) hear a
crazy TV idea, and 2) catch me up on what you're working on? I'm just about
to jump over the kids-old-enough-for-me-to-dig-deep hurdle and I'm keen to
hear how you're changing the world these days!

All best wishes,
Josh
