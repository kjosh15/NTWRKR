Back at you! Curious to hear more about how you're bringing multivariate
testing to bear in the health space...

Wed. the 15th at 8am PST works for me - want to FaceTime me at 347-268-0376=
?

All best,
Josh

Meet Josh Klein. Josh is one of my oldest friends (we=E2=80=99ve actually k=
nown one another since pre-school). Josh is interested in learning more abo=
ut opportunities in your org. He has done lots of past work for the IDEO Te=
ch Strategy team on embedded sensors and quantified systems in the healthca=
re space and I think he=E2=80=99d be a great fit for Apple. <br>
<br>
You should also ask him about his show on the History Channel, and his Ted =
talk on crows (not joking).<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
