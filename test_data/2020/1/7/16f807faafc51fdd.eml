Happy 2020! Still time-starved? Let me know if you're game to get your
thinking shook - I'm trying to figure out how to sell a mini Cambridge
Analytica (we're pitching it to Cardi B), how to use psychometrics with the
CIA, and whether to go work for a hedge fund or keep playing with startups.
Also, I hear you're changing the world: let's reconnect!

All best,
Josh

P.S. Will hit you on Whatsapp also. :)
