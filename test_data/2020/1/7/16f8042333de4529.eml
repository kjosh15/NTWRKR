After 2000 miles of driving through the Texan desert at 55mph think this is
where I came out.

 

*	In order to maintain social cohesion in global north societies we
need a technological mechanism to push behaviours towards those that are
beneficial to wider society
*	Unlike in China our technological mechanism needs to promote both
individual identity and group identity - not just group identity
*	Our previous behaviour push mechanisms are waning (religion, family,
parenting)
*	Declining attention spans have rendered "thinking slow" behaviour
change mechanisms (from Barack Obama's speeches to reading books)
ineffective with anybody other than the top 20% of society's
thinkers/performers
(We also see this with Indigo in that 85% of video views are from the top
20% of trust/integrity scores) 
*	So our technological mechanism needs to work with "thinking fast"
attention channels - Facebook, snapchat, tiktok and whatever comes next
(Building a new thinking fast channel isn't practical so we need to work
within existing channels)
*	Politicians now want to "do something" about social media and its
input on society
But whilst social media's algorithms remain optimised to maximise attention
any action in relation to social media will have limited impact
*	So governments need to have a level of control on social media
algorithms 
We need to legislate to require that social media platforms open up their
algorithms and allow governments to add content to feeds 
*	Question is - "what would you add to a social media feed to foster
social cohesion?"
Propaganda / psy ops videos are too blunt an instrument
*	This is where IndigoMetrics v2.0 (and lessons learnt by David's
company - Tovo?) comes in 
Govt department intersperses opportunities to rate the behaviours of others
against societal values in social media feeds. This feedback is then
combined with feedback received from each individual's workplace to prepare
integrity scores for each individual.
*	Placing individual's trust scores as a part of their individual
identity drives group identity whilst allowing variation in individual
identity

 

And possible messages for SXSW:

 

*	You may not like the way that China uses technology to drive social
cohesion
*	But by not controlling the social impact of technology at all, we
have ceded development to 5 unelected companies who do not have society's
best interests as their objective
*	We are living in an increasingly metric based world
*	So to drive social cohesion we need some sort of metric which
measures an individual's contribution to social cohesion
*	You could call this a "trust" score, a score that denotes whether an
individual's actions are compatible with society's target values
*	From our work with companies we have learnt that deriving trust
scores from on line behaviour is problematic and divisive. Your online
persona is a subset of your overall persona and therefore attempting to
measure trust from digital exhaust is an inexact way of extrapolating a
variable 
(realise we need to get better at explaining why this is a bad thing)
*	Trust scores need to be derived from off line / real world
behaviours
The Chinese have figured this out and derive their scores from elements such
as membership of the party, jay walking, failure to pay parking fines
(admittedly plus a lack of online activity that destabilises society)
*	But we want to build a society that is not centrally controlled and
dogmatic around how individual identity should be constructed
*	So the solution is peer review against high level societal values
*	We rate each other against whether our actions embody target
societal values
*	From our work with companies we have learnt that it is important to
set the target culture / values without being specific about the way or
manner in which those values are delivered 
ie we are defining values - not personality, and giving space for different
individual identities within a set of cohesive cultural norms 
*	Imagine if our target values were - "Reliability", "Respect of
others" and "Enthusiasm"
These 3 values are sufficiently broad to allow individual identity but they
provide a basis for social identity and social cohesion. Individual
governments could develop separate sets of values to allow tribal national
identities within a cohesive world
*	How are we going to do this?
Within the workplace it is relatively straightforward - peer review against
target corporate values - and then exchange of workplace data
In the wider world it is more challenging - we advocate government control
of social media algorithms to place peer review against societal values
within individual's feeds
*	But you may have a better idea? 
If you have any ideas about how we can use technology to drive social norms
- both within the workplace and in the wider world, please get in touch

 

So the pitch to CIA U is something like - peer review tech has immediate
applications in the workplace but could also be central to how we manage
societal norms in wider society - government departments are going to need
to be central to this - the CIA has the technical abilities to move this
forward, lets work together...?
