Word from my contact with family in destruction derbies is:

"The best derby scenario that I have been to on the east coast is in New
Alexandria, PA.

It=E2=80=99s a demo derby only track which is better because they are norma=
lly just
a single finale event that may or may not happen. But this place is the
best- http://www.newalexandrialions.com/

The derby season starts up again in May or June."

So!
