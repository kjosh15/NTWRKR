Subject: Trump-Stormy porn

This "fleshes" out my thinking on it a bit better - still waiting on my
Stormy contact for a warm intro. Again, would love to know your objections:


The gist of the idea is to produce a porno, possibly in a
documentary-style, about Trump=E2=80=99s affair with Stormy, starring Storm=
y. We'll
sure to cast a sympathetic Melania, abandoned at home with her newborn son.
There should also be a scene where Stormy fantasizes about a well-endowed
Barack Obama, constantly making comparisons with Trump as this will
absolutely drive Trump insane. Stormy promotes it so it should get wide
play. We'll micro-target the trailer directly at evangelicals to chip away
at the president's base.


As you can see, porn could be THE key wedge issue in smashing Trump=E2=80=
=99s
coalition:
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/12/21003109/pornography-obs=
cenity-barr-doj-conservatives-libertarians
.


We can also promote it on places like Pornhub to get Trump=E2=80=99s non-re=
ligious
(or religious and hypocritical followers) following. However, the media is
constantly eager to talk about porn, so getting earned media shouldn't be a
problem in an election year.

The idea is to ensure Trump and porn are deeply associated in his base=E2=
=80=99s
minds which should help discourage turnout and drive other religious
Christians to vote third party.

Financing can be straightforward, as it can be crowdfunded, thus earning
additional media attention. Once completed, we can produce gobs of targeted
content that we drive for the full cycle - have Stormy shadow Trump,
hawking the tape and other events, and also produce sequels, etc.
