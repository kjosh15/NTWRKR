Long time no speak!! I was curious if you had a few moments to talk - first
just to catch up on the last couple years, and secondly about TAI; the
behavior measurement platform I've been working on for the last couple
years has turned a corner in marrying qualitative and quantitative data and
it struck me that you guys might be able to answer the pressing question of
"what do we do now" which we're getting from many of our clients. Let me
know if you have a moment to chat!

All best,
Josh
