I'm writing as I recently completed a formal technology strategy for one of
your competitors. Having worked with John Maeda in the past (as a speaker
at PopTech) I was stuck by how rich the opportunity space is right now and
would love to connect to see if the same overlap existed with you. Let me
know if you have time in the next couple weeks to connect!

All best,
Josh
