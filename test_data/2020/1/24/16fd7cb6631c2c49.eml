Long time no speak - you up for a catch up call just to shoot the shit and
revisit plans? I'm in a funk because the teacher I've been working with was
restaffed to drama (from science??) AND the school he's based in ganked
internet access for the crowbox, so I need to restart finding a local
school to launch at. Fuckers!

That said, I'm certainly not giving up and could use a sharp mind to bounce
ideas off of. Let me know if you're game!

Hope all's well on your end,
Josh
