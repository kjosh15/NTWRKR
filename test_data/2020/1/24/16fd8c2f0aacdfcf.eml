Dear loved ones,

I realize that with the impact on my capacity of all this recent struggle, =
I have not been great at consistently communicating with you all about my e=
fforts to address things. So, I thought it would be worthwhile to send a gr=
oup update.

First, I'll start with the good news. Returning to the structure, purpose a=
nd successful engagement of my work has caused a small reduction in my symp=
toms. I have been focusing the bulk of my energy on engaging with this issu=
e and have found some benefits from acupuncture, contact with my sponsor, (=
moderate) physical activity and meditation practice. I am continuing to wor=
k with my doctor and have returned to seeing my previous counselor who spec=
ializes in PTSD.

The "bad" (really more frustrating) news has to do with my attempts to enga=
ge specialists. I originally received two referrals through my doctor, from=
 there I was referred on to six more potential services. I have been in con=
tact with a LOT of people and found that most programs did not have availab=
ility until mid-february, so eagerly took an intake that was available for =
1/13. Sadly, at that meeting I was recommended for hospitalization but with=
out much explaination of why this was necessary. I expressed concern about =
missing work and created a plan for combining weekly outpatient counseling =
with dietician meetings.

After a lot of communication and requests for information, I got an appoint=
ment with the dietician, but was told that the counselors waitlist is "seve=
ral months" long. In conjunction with my doctor, we explored the Intensive =
Outpatient Program as an alternative in hopes of getting counseling more qu=
ickly. Not only is this difficult to navigate (three hours daily, seven day=
s a week means I don't have the ability to start until late February), but =
there doesn't seem to be an option for any counseling services prior to tha=
t. Additionally to this, at my first meeting with the dietician on 1/22, I =
was told that they'd be recommending that I abstain from all exercise.

I am currently seeking a second opinion at the encouragement of my doctor, =
counselor and sponsor because I am not feeling heard currently in wanting t=
o use a strengths-based approach. I have been reminded that I have agency w=
ithin my own care. I keep being told to stop using my current healthy copin=
g strategies. Specifically I consider the best/healthiest parts of my life =
to be my work that provides structure, purpose and meaning; my regular move=
ment practice, especially running, dancing and yoga and my connections/bein=
g of service within my recovery community. I am seeking a program wherein I=
 can continue in work, some reduced or moderate movement practice and spend=
ing time with my sober supports. My fear is that if I give up too many of m=
y healthy habits, I will eventually resort to unhealthy ways of coping and =
I don't need any more of those.

Last but not least, as you know my birthday is coming up next month. I am l=
ooking forward to celebrating in a variety of ways both my 43rd navel birth=
day and my 2nd sober birthday. I do not in any way expect any gifts as we'r=
e all adults. If, however, you feel so moved I am seeking a few things for =
my new home. I need to replace the pots and pans I lost in my last move, I =
would like a fruit bowl and I'd like more black and white family photos (ma=
ybe of my adorable nephews - hint!) for my family photo wall. The parental =
unit are coming to visit me for lunch on 2/9, I have a restaurant in mind t=
hat we could visit together. I welcome visits from any of you all who would=
 like to see my little corner of south Seattle. I am hoping to purchase tic=
kets shortly to go see the NYC family and celebrate together.

I am sorry for the lengthy message, but I wanted to be thorough. Please fee=
l free to ask any questions that you have and I'll try to be more consisten=
t in my communication going forward. I'm so grateful for the love and suppo=
rt from each of you. I'm truly blessed to have you in my life.

Love,
Devon
