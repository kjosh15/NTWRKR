I populated it as per the latest EB Calendar and put in the same basic
schedule we've been using. As ever, happy to adjust, edit, revise, etc. as
needed or desired - take a look and let us know what changes you have in
mind and we'll figure it out. Stoked to see our kids rocking another season
at Ella Baker!

All best,
- J
