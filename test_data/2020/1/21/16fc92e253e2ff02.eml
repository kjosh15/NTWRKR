I caught up with my property focussed friend and he suggested the target
below for a =E2=80=9Cchanging financial behaviours=E2=80=9D pitch =E2=80=93=
 but as below I think I
still have questions as to what we are pitching / offering.



The opportunity is:

   - A portfolio of (mostly Irish) residential property that has been
   bought with the intention of turning it into social housing
   - But the guys that are selling are getting out of the business of
   social housing and would like to try and take a profit by persuading oth=
ers
   that it is the sourcing of the property that is the difficult part =E2=
=80=93 the
   upgrading and leasing to the govt being the easy part
   - There are only 3 firms that are in the market to buy the portfolio and
   it is possible to identify the decision makers at those 3 firms
   - Approx. sale value is =E2=82=AC100m
   - The guys selling the portfolio are =E2=80=9Csharks=E2=80=9D and probab=
ly wouldn=E2=80=99t be
   averse to a novel approach to ramping the price
   - We talked about $2000 per decision maker =E2=80=93 so maybe $30k for 1=
5
   decision makers. Price probably not an issue if we have a strong product
   offering =E2=80=93 even if we cant directly prove impact.



The challenge I have is I am not convinced of the product we are offering:

   - Can we reliably place content in front of this kind of low digital use
   target
   - How can we get up to speed on the psych issues involved (in what is a
   pretty esoteric sell) to reliably produce relevant behaviour changing
   content, particularly given we wont be able to A / B and iteratively imp=
rove
   - What are we actually planning to do, are we only targeting the
   individual or do we also go after others in their digital circle?



Probably mostly a question for David =E2=80=93 but aren=E2=80=99t we better=
 at looking for
an American opportunity with a less esoteric asset? Or using something like
the Exxon opportunity as a bridge to this kind of very targeted operation?
I could also try for more Exxon type opportunities through Lane 4 if that
is what we are targeting.
