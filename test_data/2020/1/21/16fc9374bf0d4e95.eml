David,

My friend Kris Wood suggested that he needed a summary for both the
political and the real estate angles. Does the following work?

1) Cambridge Analytica changed the view of what targeted advertising could
do to the field of politics. These technologies have now become standard
operating procedure for the right, but are largely being left behind on the
left. We propose to use similar technologies at a higher standard to ensure
Biden's victory in the presidential election.

2) In the wake of Cambridge Analytica scaled demographic analytics have
become an increasingly standard part of marketing, spurring demand for more
and more data about individual behavior both online and off. It's the same
models of swaying large groups of people at greater and greater scale.

What's been missed is that this growing data ecosystem allows you to target
smaller groups of people more deeply. We propose to use similar techniques
to hypertarget the decision makers around prespecified commercial real
estate deals to first prove that we can improve returns, and then to use
our results to create diagnostic and defensive strategies to protect our
stakeholders.

Let me know what you think!
- J
