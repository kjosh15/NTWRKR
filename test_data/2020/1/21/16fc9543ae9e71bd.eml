Long time no speak! I've spent the last couple years mostly focused on
producing technology innovation strategy and retainer work for senior
executives, followed by a growing focus on microtargeting and behavior
analytics. Let me know if you have time in the next few months to catch up
and see if our work overlaps!

All best,
Josh
