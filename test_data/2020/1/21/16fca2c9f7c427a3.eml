Thanks for the update, and congratulations on the new role. Tech Strategy
in Advisory sounds much more in line with the work I've been doing since we
last spoke - would you be available for a short call to see if there's
overlap? I'm looking for a new kind of role with an organization that's
creating real impact.

This time of year is quite busy as we work through business planning and
closing out our current fiscal year.

The primary projects address the key areas we discussed during our
in-person session and your subsequent meetings with Chris.
