Hi Hulda,

Thanks for sending this-- how wonderful!  Othinn seemed proud when I told
him this morning you'd sent me a picture of him doing math.

I meant to email you last Friday, but the week got away from me.
Othinn has been soaring!  It seems like he's really interested in school in
every regard- math, reading, and writing.  I've been blown away by his
creativity and the work he's been doing.

Too, I did an informal spelling/phonics assessment for all the kids last
week and I noticed that Othinn had some interesting spellings for certain
sounds- vowels especially.  It's not that it was "wrong" per se, it just
made me think of the dual language learning and how he seems more flexible
in his understanding of sounds (combining vowels, recognizing letter
blends, etc.) . I actually think this is a great strength that will serve
him as he gets deeper into the complexities (and inconsistencies) in
spelling.

To sum it up: you have an awesome kiddo :)
Eleanor
