Long time no speak!! You showcased my crowbox idea (www.thecrowbox.com) at
an event in Milan. I recently developed the technology strategy for a world
leading design firm and was reminded of who you guys are. I checked back in
and you're doing amazing stuff - is there someone over there that'd be game
for a catchup conversation to see if there's overlap?

All best,
Josh
