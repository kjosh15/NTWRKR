Anne,

I recently spoke to Ron about the microtargeting work I've been doing and
he mentioned you're doing some work in real estate. This seems like a prime
target for improving traction using some of the new technologies I've been
exploring. Are you up for a short call or quick coffee to see if there's an
opportunity here?

Many thanks,
Josh
