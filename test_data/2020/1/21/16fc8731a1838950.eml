I caught up with my property focussed friend and he suggested the target =
below for a =E2=80=9Cchanging financial behaviours=E2=80=9D pitch =
=E2=80=93 but as below I think I still have questions as to what we are =
pitching / offering.

=20

The opportunity is:

*	A portfolio of (mostly Irish) residential property that has been =
bought with the intention of turning it into social housing=20
*	But the guys that are selling are getting out of the business of =
social housing and would like to try and take a profit by persuading =
others that it is the sourcing of the property that is the difficult =
part =E2=80=93 the upgrading and leasing to the govt being the easy part
*	There are only 3 firms that are in the market to buy the portfolio and =
it is possible to identify the decision makers at those 3 firms
*	Approx. sale value is =E2=82=AC100m
*	The guys selling the portfolio are =E2=80=9Csharks=E2=80=9D and =
probably wouldn=E2=80=99t be averse to a novel approach to ramping the =
price
*	We talked about $2000 per decision maker =E2=80=93 so maybe $30k for =
15 decision makers. Price probably not an issue if we have a strong =
product offering =E2=80=93 even if we cant directly prove impact.

=20

The challenge I have is I am not convinced of the product we are =
offering:

*	Can we reliably place content in front of this kind of low digital use =
target
*	How can we get up to speed on the psych issues involved (in what is a =
pretty esoteric sell) to reliably produce relevant behaviour changing =
content, particularly given we wont be able to A / B and iteratively =
improve
*	What are we actually planning to do, are we only targeting the =
individual or do we also go after others in their digital circle?

=20

Probably mostly a question for David =E2=80=93 but aren=E2=80=99t we =
better at looking for an American opportunity with a less esoteric =
asset? Or using something like the Exxon opportunity as a bridge to this =
kind of very targeted operation? I could also try for more Exxon type =
opportunities through Lane 4 if that is what we are targeting.
