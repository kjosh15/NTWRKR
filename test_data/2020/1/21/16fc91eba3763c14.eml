Thank you so much for the update! Really appreciate this; it makes such a
huge difference to have insight into his life at school. If there's ever
anything we can do to help support his interests we'd love the feedback -
you have a different view into our son's life than we do, so we're always
happy to hear more.

Thanks again for helping Othinn grow,
Josh
