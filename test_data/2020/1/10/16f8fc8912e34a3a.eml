Good to see you yesterday!! Sounds like Cisco's doing some interesting
stuff, albeit in very narrow silos... I'll be curious to hear what comes of
your team centralization efforts.

In the meantime, I'd love to talk to Rich Smith if you can introduce us,
and let me know when is best for you and Sasuke (sp?) to hit queens for
dinner sometime. If you want to see the chaos children can engender we're
always willing displays. ;)

Otherwise let's connect again for coffee soon - I'm always keen to hear
about your latest expoits, and maybe you can help me think through how/if
persuasion technologies can be used ethically... (!)
