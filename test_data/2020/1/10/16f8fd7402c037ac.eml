Brilliant, thanks so much! I've shared the strategy doc with you - not that
you need to read all 100+ pages of notes, etc. but at least so you have
something to reference if you so choose!

Erin, let me know when Ilya's available - Mondays and Fridays are best for
me, but I can be flexible.

All best,
Josh
