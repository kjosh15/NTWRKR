Ben,

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday; as ever, I learned a ton and
was surprised how much time had passed when we left!! It was also hugely
reassuring to hear more about how Google operates and that there is indeed
really interesting work being done there...

To that end, do you mind introducing me to Alison Lindz and Sarah, your
tech program manager? I'd like to hear a little more about the other kinds
of work your group is doing, and then potentially push to talk to Blaze if
it looks like there are ways I can add value. In the meantime I'll get a CV
over so I can talk with an official recruiter, if that's helpful.

I'm also game to talk to Andrew Eland, if you think he'd enjoy it. I'm
curious if Arup has done any embedded sensor projects as I've been talking
with Sutter Health about making a home rife with them to look for wellness
feedback loops to study. Regardless, he sounds like a stellar human being
and I always like to meet those.

Otherwise I'll check out deeplearning.ai, Nord in London, and Coral - this
https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/03/introducing-coral-our-platform-fo=
r.html
is the most updated link I could find, from last March, so let me know if
there's somewhere more detailed I should be looking!

Much obliged and let me know when you're next in NY - maybe we can get
Meredith out also!

All best,
Josh
