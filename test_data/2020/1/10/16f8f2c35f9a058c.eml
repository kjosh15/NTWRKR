I think this really informs my feeling of concern about the USA; despite sta=
ggering inequality and rapidly growing disparities in potential income mobil=
ity, Americans still buy the =E2=80=9CAmerican dream=E2=80=9D that they, unl=
ike any of their statistically representative peers, will somehow jump ahead=
 through good fortune and/or hard work. But that simple isn=E2=80=99t true, a=
nd the result is even more precarious lives for an ever growing percent of t=
he nation.

Xoxo,
