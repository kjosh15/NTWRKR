This kind of article really winds me up - its so well informed and well
written and then ends with "This is not a technological project but a
political one." - ie it is the writer's job to make himself look good by his
understanding of the problem - but he would like to stay in his ivory tower
and not actually suggest how we could improve matters.

I also disagree with the statement. 

- I agree that we have got ourselves to where we are today because of
offline trends (polarisation of political parties, reduction in parenting,
less religion and other glue) that have been accelerated by online
developments.
- But I think we have changed human attention span to such an extent that we
cannot expect to address the challenge using political approaches (just
elect AOC as president and all will be well) - we have got ourselves to the
point where the solution has to be a technological project because this is
the only way we can hold and direct attention spans for long enough to make
a difference.

(as an aside - how have we changed human attention span? Also a combination
of offline and online - a change in parenting styles over the past 40 years
that has been accelerated by the availability of digital distraction - but
we aren't going to change parent so we need to deal with the challenge as a
technological one)

As for the rest:

"In the absence of a grand, substantive vision for who "we" are, we draw our
strength and certainty from the coherent depravity of "them." "
Yes - the technological challenge is to create a substantive vision for who
we are.

"It's unclear how it could even begin to account for the very nonsymbolic
violence that spilled off of Facebook and into the real worlds of Myanmar
and Sri Lanka-and, depending on your perspective, the United States as
well."
If you can create vision for who "we" are, you reduce the violence against
"them".
