 our import partner is still actively working on this problem!<br /><br=
 />As for freezing your account, that's not an option we provide because=
 we <em>truly </em>believe YNAB is worth the money, even without Direct=
 Import. We offer <a href=3D"https://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/32-=
recording-spending-adding-transactions">other features</a>, like the mob=
ile apps and <a href=3D"http://docs.youneedabudget.com/article/173-file-=
based-import">File-Based Importing</a>, that make YNAB completely functi=
onal and easy to use even if import isn't currently available. This is a=
lso why we don't alter the cost for folks whose banks aren't supported a=
t all.<br /><br />I hope you can understand where we're coming from ther=
e. <span>Since I can see you've been communicating with us about Capital=
 One for <em>awhile</em>, I've added on a free month to your subscriptio=
n as a more tangible apology. I know it doesn't replace a completely smo=
oth Direct Import experience, but I hope it helps a little. You're now s=
et until <strong>June 21, 2020.</strong><br /><br />And as Kait mentione=
d before, if YNAB is no longer the best budgeting option for you, we'd b=
e happy to cancel your subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br /><=
br />Let me know what you think and if you have any questions on this, I=
'm happy to go over it more with you. :)</span><br /></div><br>=0A     =

w weeks, but some are more complex and take more time to diagnose and fi=
x. We're working closely with them to get a fix for you as quickly as po=
ssible.  <br /><br />I completely understand where you're coming from th=
ough. It <em>does</em> feel unfair to pay for something when it isn't wo=
rking as expected=E2=80=94I get that. <span>We believe very deeply that=
 YNAB is worth the cost <em>without</em> direct import, though. With tha=
t said, if those other transaction entry options are not satisfactory to=
 you, I understand that as well. Given the imperfect nature of transacti=
on aggregation, it might mean that YNAB just isn't the best option for y=
ou. If that's the case, I'd be happy to cancel your subscription and iss=
ue a pro-rated refund.<br /><br />If you do choose to hang in there with=
 us, given the holiday season, we won't be sending regular updates, but=
 we <em>will</em> reach out when we hear any news! <br /><br />Let me kn=
ow if you have any questions at all, I'd be happy to go over this more w=
