                <div>Hi Josh, <br><br>I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re still hav=
ing trouble with your Capital One connection.<br><br>Our Direct Import part=
ner is working hard on this issue, but they don&#39;t have a resolution qui=
te yet. Typically, issues can be resolved within a few weeks, but some are =
more complex and take more time to diagnose and fix. We&#39;re working clos=
ely with them to get a fix for you as quickly as possible.  <br><br>I compl=
etely understand where you&#39;re coming from though. It <em>does</em> feel=
 unfair to pay for something when it isn&#39;t working as expected=E2=80=94=
I get that. <span>We believe very deeply that YNAB is worth the cost <em>wi=
thout</em> direct import, though. With that said, if those other transactio=
n entry options are not satisfactory to you, I understand that as well. Giv=
en the imperfect nature of transaction aggregation, it might mean that YNAB=
 just isn&#39;t the best option for you. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d be=
 happy to cancel your subscription and issue a pro-rated refund.<br><br>If =
you do choose to hang in there with us, given the holiday season, we won&#3=
9;t be sending regular updates, but we <em>will</em> reach out when we hear=
 any news! <br><br>Let me know if you have any questions at all, I&#39;d be=
 happy to go over this more with you.</span></div><br>
