I like your points about the operating environment fundamentally having
shifted and that changing the conditions we need to consider. Pointing out
the attention span problem seems a little trite at this point, as
pertinent as it actually may be, but I really like the idea of attributing
new means of leverage to same - i.e., framing it as a narrowing of
attention over time producing greater impact within the range of impact
(i.e., mostly social / mobile).

The Vision of "We" idea is also appealing, but I still don't buy it as a
comprehensive strategy, especially when it's clear that Trump won by
telling different people the things they wanted to hear, even when those
were diametric.

There's a deep dark corner of my soul that's starting to think China has it
right - feed people the right content and control the ways in which they
share their responses to it and you can shape the outcomes such that they
benefit the largest share of the population the most. So super fucked up
and also kind of inescapable. As ever, how can you allow for organic growth
if ideas?
