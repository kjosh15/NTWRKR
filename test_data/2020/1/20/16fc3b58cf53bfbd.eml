Hey Eve, glad to hear you're hitting the road again! AFAIK we should just
be getting back from Iceland in time for you to stop by, and you're free to
enjoy the couch if you like! Just to warn you, it'll be one of the more
exciting stops on your trip as the kids are usually up and running around
by 6 and we're on the 5th floor of a walkup, but if you're willing to roll
with it we're glad to have you! Let us know how the planning shakes out and
we'll let you know if anything changes; we're still trying to figure out
our final schedule for our tickets now.

All best,
Josh
