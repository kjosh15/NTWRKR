Damn, that's amazing. I'd really like to see the profile of one person =
we haven't met and then meet them f2f to see how/if the data predicts =
the person - already knowing Brian and Theresa makes it hard to know =
what we're reading into this.

=20

Given how appealing this is I suggest we have Rivel pay for the whole =
thing, but make it clear that it'll be upgrading our entire platform =
(not just for them). I don't think they can miss out on it now that =
they've seen it!

=20

Why would reporting on the data make emegent phenomena LESS likely? =
Especially if we only expose it to management?

Cast you eyes over the numbers =E2=80=93 I find it amazing how you can =
accurately capture the essence of a person in this data =E2=80=93 =
particularly because Rivel have included =E2=80=9Cstyle=E2=80=9D values =

If we are going to try and marry Indigo with a targeted digital approach =
