First: there's a big difference between a Program Manager and a Product
Manager (and there's also a third divide: Technical Program Manager).
Program Managers tend to be involved in the day-to-day of the team, whereas
Product Managers are more about ... products. :-)

That said, the first one looks interesting, tho I had to look to see who
they meant by "CTO". Turns out this is about cloud. The other two I feel
like are not a great fit, try again with product manager and see what you
get. :-)
