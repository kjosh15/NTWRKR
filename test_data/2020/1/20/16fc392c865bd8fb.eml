Cool, thanks! That made things simpler; there were only three positions
with "Product Manager" in the title in NY, NY. Of them, these seemed ok:

Group Product Manager, Google Cloud
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/101821797847966406/

...which looks like the senior version of this:

Product Manager, Google Cloud
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/123457298853962438/

I also wanted to mention this one:

Partner Manager, Distribution
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/89325843970433734/

... as it seemed more interesting. That said, all three of the above are
about cloud, which isn't really my interest. (At least, compared to helping
build technologies which are going to change how we all live our lives in
the near future, such as personalized AI or on-device secure distributed
processing, etc.!)

Let me know if this does the trick, and thanks again for all the help!!
