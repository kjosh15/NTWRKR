Ben,

Here's three that were based in NY, popped up when I typed in Program
Manager, and described some work I'd find interesting. You're spot on that
it's hard to say if I'd be really interested without knowing the
projects/platforms/products I'd be working on, but I suppose that's part of
the process!!

Technical Director, Office of the CTO, Security
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/92005081546662598/

Product and Business Strategy Lead, Analytics
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/103472575507505862/

Client Program Manager, Global Client and Agency Solutions
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/112822297934340806/

If any of these are off for any reason I'm happy to go back in.

I poked through coral.ai and it sits firmly into my thinking around the
evolution of AI and corporate / personal information design: as you
mentioned, it's where you're designing it to go next that's the really
interesting bit! And some of the distributed computing stuff you alluded to
sounds seriously interesting in terms of impact, esp. when paired with some
of the premises coral.ai seems to be espousing around data ownership and
exportability.

Let me know how I can best move things forward - I'm still keen to hear
from Alison, Sarah, and Blaise if you hear back that they're willing. After
talking to Andrew it's clear that Google is the kind of place you get in
and then navigate, but also that the group you start in can make a big
difference. I'd like to change the world quicker rather than slower, if you
get my meaning.

All best and thanks so much again!
- J
