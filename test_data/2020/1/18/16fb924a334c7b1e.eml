I'd forgotten that the best way to refer includes you choosing some
advertised jobs to apply to (8x more likely to get hired if you do!) -
don't worry, once interviewing is done we have an opportunity to hire for
jobs that weren't available at the time or aren't advertised yet, so you're
not actually committing at this point...

Take a look at https://careers.google.com/ - as discussed, I'd guess
product management is the way to go - don't actually apply, just give me
links for ones that appeal and we'll review - ideally we want to choose
three.
