I'm about to set off for more travel, so there will be a delay, do feel
free to nag - back home on Feb 4th. In the meantime, I could just throw you
into the Google recruiting machine if you want? The way it works is,
assuming the first stages are passed, Google interviews without necessarily
having much regard for a particular job, then those who look promising
become available to those with headcount, so might be worth just getting
that under way - it can take some time!

As I mentioned, we don't get know who has what headcount...
