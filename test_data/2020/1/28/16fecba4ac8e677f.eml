Jon,

Thanks again for the conversation the other day - it was hugely encouraging
to see you digging into the problem of tech IDEO-wide!

I recently spoke with Ilya in SF (and put in a good word for Madison to
hurry up and get you a response!) and he pointed out that it may be useful
to push on some of the outward-facing efforts around business development
and marketing for IDEO globally concurrent to the work you're doing. Do you
see this as a potential vector for gathering more market data to enrich
your findings and sharpen the recommendations you end up making?

Let me know if it's worth a conversation,
Josh
