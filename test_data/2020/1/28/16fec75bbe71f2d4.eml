Long time no speak! I just wrapped up the technology strategy for a major
design firm, and after several years of freelance consulting both of my
boys are entering school full time. As a result, I'm looking for bigger,
longer term, more impactful work to really sink my teeth into.

I've really enjoyed your approach to business and have long felt that there
was significant opportunity to move the needle with new technology in your
industry. Would you (or someone else at BP) be the right person to talk to
to see if I could play a role? As ever, any advice is appreciated!

Looking forward,
Josh
