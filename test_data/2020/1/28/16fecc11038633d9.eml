Dude, sorry SoCal didn't work out!! Curious to hear what caused the
turnaround. Let me know how the hunt goes - FWIW my folks live in Walla
Walla which has one foot in Oregon and one in WA and seems to have a ton of
what you may be looking for.

Stoked to hear your ideas about the project - let me know when you've got a
handle on where/when for next steps and we can reconnect!
