We met briefly at Diana's departure in NYC - I was developing the
technology strategy for that office. It's finished, and after speaking with
Jon Wetterson about it (and his own work in that area) I'm hugely curious
about its implications for IDEO globally.

Let me know if you've seen the doc, and/or if you have any interest in a
conversation about how the strategic recommendations (particularly around
marketing and business development) could be used in parallel to the
research Jon is conducting!

All best,
Josh
