Meet Josh Klein. Josh is one of my oldest friends (we=E2=80=99ve actually k=
nown one another since pre-school). Josh is interested in learning more abo=
ut opportunities in your org. He has done lots of past work for the IDEO Te=
ch Strategy team on embedded sensors and quantified systems in the healthca=
re space and I think he=E2=80=99d be a great fit for Apple. <br>
<br>
You should also ask him about his show on the History Channel, and his Ted =
talk on crows (not joking).<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
