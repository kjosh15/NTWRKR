Long time no speak! I've just wrapped up the technology strategy for a
major design firm, and after several years of freelance consulting both of
my boys are entering school full time. As a result, I'm looking for bigger,
longer term, more impactful work to really sink my teeth into.

I've really enjoyed your approach to business and am particularly
interested in your use of careful strategy in conducting your M&A, JV, and
CVC efforts: few of the businesses I've worked with actually practice the
level of rigor you describe. Would you (or someone else at HP) would be the
right person to talk to to see if I could play a role? As ever, any advice
is appreciated!

Looking forward,
Josh
