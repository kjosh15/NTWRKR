Long time no speak! After several years of freelance technology consulting
both of my boys are entering school full time. As a result, I'm looking for
bigger, longer term, more impactful work to really sink my teeth into. Do
you have time to reconnect and compare notes - it's been a while, and a lot
has happened!

All best and looking forward,
Josh
