The cats are just adorable=E2=80=A6 They played for a little bit but are now=
 just snoopin our bags and sniffin us out lol. <br>
<br>
Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and full=
y close the windows that were left slightly open? Or do you leave the window=
s for the fresh air?<br>
<br>
Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done r=
ight for you!<br>

Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
