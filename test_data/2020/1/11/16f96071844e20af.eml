1) If I understand this right, we can effectively micro-target:

- any device we can get a cookie on
- anyone within a specific geospatial position at a certain time

Beyond that, we can aggregate existing content and/or create our own that
we think will influence the viewer, with the caveat that the more
intelligent and educated the viewer the harder it is to get them to click
through.

Accepted knowledge is that you need roughly 5 clickthroughs to influence
someone's thinking. Our goal would be to get our targets to click on 5-10
pieces of content to influence their thinking within a month's time.

One other angle is to attempt to create a reverse social graph and
influence those potential influencers.

"Industry standards" dictates that you must announce if you position
content in front of someone specific, but this could be a shell company,
and in any case the only downside is being kicked from an advertiser's
consortium.

For our purposes we would simply buy all the data we needed, outsource any
content creation, and employ an engineer to organize, time, and deliver the
content.

Average price is $100k to influence 30 people - does that include all
materials? Would want to cover our time in this as well.

Let me know what I may have missed from the above, and thanks!!
