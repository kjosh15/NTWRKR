Hey Josh -

Hope your weekend is off to a great start.
And - I'll follow up on our discussion of soccer stuff from this afternoon.

We'd bopped around a couple of different organizations when we first found
GWYSL (gwysl.org) - and we definitely preferred it by a long way to other
soccer orgs. It's all parent run and has parent coaches. Usually, those
parent coaches were reasonably soccer savvy AND had a real interest in
getting kids to enjoy the game. It's a practice on Monday or Wednesday and
a game on Saturday - that said, there are no standings, the kids name their
own teams, and the organizers of the league try to do everything they can
to balance the teams. The only drawback is the league is constantly begging
for coaches, so every once in a while you'll get a dud.

Last winter, Tom finished his GWYSL season and was desparate to play over
the winter, and we found Lajos Geenen
https://www.longislandcitysoccerclub.com/. Lajos is still a bit of a
mystery to us in terms of his soccer background (there are rumors all
around about his exploits, but he doesn't put a bio anywhere). He's serious
and dedicated, at the same time, he's very kind and never raises his voice.
Lajos (and his two amazing assistants) runs his org much like a "club" - in
which kids just come and train - 30 minutes skills, 30 minutes scrimmage.
He does have competitive teams that compete in local leagues and
tournaments, but those are invite only and he can be very mysterious about
who he asks and when.

Okay - that ended up being longer than I expected. That said, if you have
any questions about these two orgs, or about any of the other ones you've
come across, let me know.

See you soon!
Pat
