Well, remember your partner - they're not easy to achieve. He didn't get a
single impression through Spinner. The fuckery comes in b/c how exactly is
the tech logging an impression? Like, if I'd been exposed to an ad if I
scrolled 75% down a page, but I only scrolled 70%, does the tech count
that? Also, super-duper easy to buy bot traffic to radically increase this
as well.

They're considered a decent mid-funnel metric as getting actual clicks is
so damn tricky. Incredibly, there are assholes out there who use it as
their primary KPI.
