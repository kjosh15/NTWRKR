Alison Lentz. Sarah, BTW is Sarah de Haas. I will need to check they're up
for it.

Yes - I've already been asked for a CV. :-)

Arup have for sure done that kind of thing - Andrew has done some stuff

Turns out there are many Nords, I meant this one: https://nordprojects.co/

I thought I'd already responded about Coral, but more info here:
https://coral.ai/ (actually linked from the blog). There's nothing public
