Hey Josh,

Sorry for the delay, below is the link for the NYC UBT estimates, you may
have to create an account if you haven't already.  They will probably ask
for some info on your 2018 tax return so have that handy or give me a call,
I'll be working all day today.  When making a payment, you are paying
towards your 2019 estimated taxes which is form 2019 NYC-5UBTI.  In terms
of an amount, I had estimated $5,547 for September and January so any
amount that you can between 0 - $11,094, just let me know what amount you
paid.

https://a836-btseservices.nyc.gov/production/eservices/_/#1

Please keep in mind that this is just NYC and that on the 2018 tax return,
I had set up 2019 estimated payments for federal and state taxes as well
(Based on 2018 income, assuming 2019 is similar).  There are penalties for
underpaying those estimates as well.

For 2019 tax return, I'd like you to get me your business info as soon as
possible so we can get the 2019 tax return done and have the 2020 estimates
paid timely.

Stephanie
