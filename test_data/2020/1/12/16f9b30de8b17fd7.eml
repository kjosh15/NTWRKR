You around for a coffee or cocktail in the next couple weeks? I'm trying to
figure out how to approach Droga/Fjord/Accenture after *almost* taking a
senior position at IDEO NY and figured you'd have some strong opinions.
It's been fucking forever and I'm curious what you're up to now!

All best wishes,
Josh
