Hey Josh,

Of the $40K, I would put $18K to Federal, $12K to state and $10K to NYC.

Federal taxes can be paid here, and you are paying the 2019 estimated tax
or form 1040ES ( you may have to create an account)

https://www.irs.gov/payments

 For State taxes, you can pay here and you are paying the 2019 estimates
tax or IT-2105 (you may have to create an account)
