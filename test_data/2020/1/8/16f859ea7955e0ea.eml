Happy 2020! We met when I was helping build out the IMAX incubator (IMAX
labs) back in 2016. Since then I've been advising senior executives at
major multinationals and early-stage startups alike on technology strategy
while watching New Labs from afar, and figured it was time to reconnect.
Are you available anytime in the next couple weeks to discuss where New
Labs is headed and if there's any overlap?

All best wishes,
Josh
