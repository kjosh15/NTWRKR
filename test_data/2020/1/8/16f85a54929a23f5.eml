Jordan,

Happy 2020! I wanted to touch base to see if/how we might help each other;
I know you don't have budget until Feb or later, but Lululemon keeps
turning up on my radar and I'm curious what you're aiming to grow in 2020.
Let me know if you have time for a quick call in the next couple weeks!

All best,
Josh
