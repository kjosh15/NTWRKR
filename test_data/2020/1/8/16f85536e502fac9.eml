"How to Freelance in 2020, an Adulting Course"

Looking to freelance, or want to improve your freelancing career? Here's an
overview from start-to-finish of what you need to build, test, and
continuous refine your freelance career - whether that involves P/  T or
3/4 time work as its base, or pure gig-to-gig contracting. Unless you're
placing all your bets on your current employer keeping you indefinitely,
these are the tools, techniques, and regular tasks you'll need to know and
complete to keep a full pipeline of opportunities - and a a growing bank
account over time. Everything in this course uses tried-and-true agile
development frameworks to test forward into only  the work that gives you
results, meaning that you'll have the tools to react to whatever changes
you want to make in the work you want to do, and will know exactly what
leads to you getting paid the way you want. Courses include:

 - CRM: managing and building your network for continuous growth
 - Marketing testing framework to get your message where - and only where -
it matters
 - LLCs, C-Corps, and business accounts: the nuts and bolts of your legal
operating framework
 - Your services portfolio: A gig is not a gig - retainers, contracts,
projects, advising, consulting, and more!

You may not know what you want to do with the rest of your life; that's the
case for most of us. Unlike most other freelancing course, this framework
lets you start getting paid while you continuously figure that out. Build
new capabilities, test them out, and then refine and rewrite the rules,
making a better rate and with more options every step of the way!

-------

You and I could build this out in a couple hours, push it out on one of the
gazillion online course platforms, and if it gets traction create the
content as it's needed. Together we represent pretty diverse (and very
typical) insight into what freelancing really is, and it'd force us to eat
our own dogfood in actually building our own work. What do you think?
