Gary,

It's been a while! LinkedIn kicked me a note that you'd retired from
Accenture - congratulations! If you're interested in talking about exciting
new tech and where the world is rocketing towards regarding I'd love to
connect and get your take in turn.

All best wishes for a wonderful 2020,
Josh
