Love this thinking, esp. in terms of the role of measurements for social
good. I especially agree that the big nut to crack is how to allow for
emergant phenomena - I.e., how to corrolate real world and online metrics
in a way that isn't proscriptive. Do you want to throw this into a deck and
we can start stripping it down / building out content for our SXSW talk?
