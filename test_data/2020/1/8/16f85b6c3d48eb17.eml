Sure =E2=80=93 will start a deck next week (on my way to Spain for rest =
of week now) =E2=80=93 will just do an outline though as I think 2 of us =
need to discuss outline first.

Think adding imagery / video similar to the talk I saw you do at NACD =
will be key =E2=80=93 and that=E2=80=99s your brilliance field!

=20

Definitely agree that =E2=80=9Calign society without being =
proscriptive=E2=80=9D is the big challenge =E2=80=93 and intuitively =
peer review of actions that align with target societal behaviours is the =
only way I can think of addressing the challenge =E2=80=93 but difficult =
to get that across. Maybe best way is to explain why other approaches =
are bad (China, Facebook, trust via digital exhaust etc) =E2=80=93 but =
at some point we are going to need a succinct explanation of how peer =
review can align without being proscriptive. Best idea so far is an =
example =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cimagine that we rated each other on our =
Reliability, Respect for Others and Enthusiasm =E2=80=93 and show the =
way that these terms are defined =E2=80=93 this would align our society =
around these basis human values whilst allowing the flexibility to be =
individual etc etc. I=E2=80=99ll stick that in the deck and we can =
discuss.

Love this thinking, esp. in terms of the role of measurements for social =
good. I especially agree that the big nut to crack is how to allow for =
emergant phenomena - I.e., how to corrolate real world and online =
metrics in a way that isn't proscriptive. Do you want to throw this into =
a deck and we can start stripping it down / building out content for our =
SXSW talk?

*	In order to maintain social cohesion in global north societies we need =
a technological mechanism to push behaviours towards those that are =
beneficial to wider society
*	Unlike in China our technological mechanism needs to promote both =
individual identity and group identity =E2=80=93 not just group identity
*	Our previous behaviour push mechanisms are waning (religion, family, =
parenting)
*	Declining attention spans have rendered =E2=80=9Cthinking =
slow=E2=80=9D behaviour change mechanisms (from Barack Obama=E2=80=99s =
speeches to reading books) ineffective with anybody other than the top =
20% of society=E2=80=99s thinkers/performers
(We also see this with Indigo in that 85% of video views are from the =
top 20% of trust/integrity scores)=20
*	So our technological mechanism needs to work with =E2=80=9Cthinking =
fast=E2=80=9D attention channels =E2=80=93 Facebook, snapchat, tiktok =
and whatever comes next
(Building a new thinking fast channel isn=E2=80=99t practical so we need =
to work within existing channels)
*	Politicians now want to =E2=80=9Cdo something=E2=80=9D about social =
media and its input on society
But whilst social media=E2=80=99s algorithms remain optimised to =
maximise attention any action in relation to social media will have =
limited impact
*	So governments need to have a level of control on social media =
algorithms=20
We need to legislate to require that social media platforms open up =
their algorithms and allow governments to add content to feeds=20
*	Question is =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cwhat would you add to a social media =
feed to foster social cohesion?=E2=80=9D
Propaganda / psy ops videos are too blunt an instrument
*	This is where IndigoMetrics v2.0 (and lessons learnt by =
David=E2=80=99s company =E2=80=93 Tovo?) comes in=20
Govt department intersperses opportunities to rate the behaviours of =
others against societal values in social media feeds. This feedback is =
then combined with feedback received from each individual=E2=80=99s =
workplace to prepare integrity scores for each individual.
*	Placing individual=E2=80=99s trust scores as a part of their =
individual identity drives group identity whilst allowing variation in =
individual identity

=20

And possible messages for SXSW:

=20

*	You may not like the way that China uses technology to drive social =
cohesion
*	But by not controlling the social impact of technology at all, we have =
ceded development to 5 unelected companies who do not have =
society=E2=80=99s best interests as their objective
*	We are living in an increasingly metric based world
*	So to drive social cohesion we need some sort of metric which measures =
an individual=E2=80=99s contribution to social cohesion
*	You could call this a =E2=80=9Ctrust=E2=80=9D score, a score that =
denotes whether an individual=E2=80=99s actions are compatible with =
society=E2=80=99s target values
*	From our work with companies we have learnt that deriving trust scores =
from on line behaviour is problematic and divisive. Your online persona =
is a subset of your overall persona and therefore attempting to measure =
trust from digital exhaust is an inexact way of extrapolating a variable =

(realise we need to get better at explaining why this is a bad thing)
*	Trust scores need to be derived from off line / real world behaviours
The Chinese have figured this out and derive their scores from elements =
such as membership of the party, jay walking, failure to pay parking =
fines (admittedly plus a lack of online activity that destabilises =
society)
*	But we want to build a society that is not centrally controlled and =
dogmatic around how individual identity should be constructed
*	So the solution is peer review against high level societal values
*	We rate each other against whether our actions embody target societal =
values
*	From our work with companies we have learnt that it is important to =
set the target culture / values without being specific about the way or =
manner in which those values are delivered=20
ie we are defining values =E2=80=93 not personality, and giving space =
for different individual identities within a set of cohesive cultural =
norms=20
*	Imagine if our target values were =E2=80=93 =
=E2=80=9CReliability=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CRespect of others=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9CEnthusiasm=E2=80=9D
These 3 values are sufficiently broad to allow individual identity but =
they provide a basis for social identity and social cohesion. Individual =
governments could develop separate sets of values to allow tribal =
national identities within a cohesive world
*	How are we going to do this?
Within the workplace it is relatively straightforward =E2=80=93 peer =
review against target corporate values =E2=80=93 and then exchange of =
workplace data
In the wider world it is more challenging =E2=80=93 we advocate =
government control of social media algorithms to place peer review =
against societal values within individual=E2=80=99s feeds
*	But you may have a better idea?=20
If you have any ideas about how we can use technology to drive social =
norms =E2=80=93 both within the workplace and in the wider world, please =
get in touch

=20

So the pitch to CIA U is something like =E2=80=93 peer review tech has =
immediate applications in the workplace but could also be central to how =
we manage societal norms in wider society =E2=80=93 government =
departments are going to need to be central to this =E2=80=93 the CIA =
has the technical abilities to move this forward, lets work =
together=E2=80=A6..?
