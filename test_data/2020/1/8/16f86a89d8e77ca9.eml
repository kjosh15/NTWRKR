I like the idea! I=E2=80=99m feeling pretty full in terms of bandwidth for a=
nything new until March. On another note, I had a long chat with Jesse from M=
ovement creative and you guys share some very similar approaches to learning=
 and systems. While I know he doesn=E2=80=99t have the funds to support your=
 involvement, I think you=E2=80=99d both get a kick out of connecting deeper=
 and possibly collaborating on some making humans healthier and happier. He=E2=
=80=99s about to step into a new growth arena with TMC and doesn=E2=80=99t r=
eally have the systems in place that really reflect his ethics. Anyhoo- you k=
now how to reach him!

ave the tools to react to whatever changes you want to make in the work you w=

 better rate and with more options every step of the way!
