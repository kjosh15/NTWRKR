Hello Josh, happy January and here's to 2020!

I wanted to remind of a couple of deadlines coming up. First, please =
take a moment to review the title, description, and speaker line up of =
your session information by January 10. While this is a soft deadline =
and you'll still be able to make tweaks after this date, we want to make =
sure your information looks as great as possible as SXSW will be =
releasing the full details to sessions on the online schedule and SXSW =
GO app starting on January 14.


I also want to take this time to offer myself up for an optional call =
with you to discuss logistics and session content with all speakers. In =
addition to covering session details and onsite logistics, this call =
also gives everyone a chance to plan out session content before meeting =
in the green room. This call is optional but often very helpful to =
session organizers and speakers so please let me know if you would like =
to schedule a time to talk!

Additionally, if you know of speakers that might need any accessibility =
support covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, please be =
sure to fill out the SXSW Accessibility form: =

form, please email access@sxsw.com <mailto:access@sxsw.com> . They'll be =
able to help you with what and how we may be able to accommodate.

As always, if you have any questions, please let me know.

All the best,
Margot Vidal
