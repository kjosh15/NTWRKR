Sweets,

I have a few projects that are bottlenecking on you and I working together. 
Does this work as a time to review these topics?

- Living abroad
- Reviewing Life_Skills_List_Sorted.txt (skills for the boys to have 
practiced by the time they're 18)
- Budget: will/does YNAB work?

Additionally, can you tell me:

- Emergency docs: did you already update these on the copy that's in my 
cabinet?
- Vanguard account: do you need anything to get this done other than time?
- Bugout bag review: can you suggest a time for us to do this Q1 2020?

xoxo!
Josh
