Hello Josh, happy January and here's to 2020!

I wanted to remind of a couple of deadlines coming up. First, please take a
moment to review the title, description, and speaker line up of your
session information by January 10. While this is a soft deadline and you'll
still be able to make tweaks after this date, we want to make sure your
information looks as great as possible as SXSW will be releasing the full
details to sessions on the online schedule and SXSW GO app starting on
January 14.

I also want to take this time to offer myself up for an *optional* call
with you to discuss logistics and session content with all speakers. In
addition to covering session details and onsite logistics, this call also
gives everyone a chance to plan out session content before meeting in the
green room. This call is optional but often very helpful to session
organizers and speakers so please let me know if you would like to schedule
a time to talk!

Additionally, if you know of speakers that might need any accessibility
support covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, please be sure
to fill out the SXSW Accessibility form:
https://form.jotform.com/91743235842156
<https://sxsw-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=115RWE6Mr1ndnNmzcKRLVyZefmwOKHizzh7I5A3Gl4PE-0&key=YAMMID-27235982&link=https%3A%2F%2Fform.jotform.com%2F91743235842156>.
If you have questions about this form, please email access@sxsw.com.
They'll be able to help you with what and how we may be able to accommodate.

As always, if you have any questions, please let me know.

All the best,
Margot Vidal
