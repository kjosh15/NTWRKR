This is GENIUS. I'd remove the bit at the end about the presidential
election, as it feels like a distraction, but otherwise think this is an
excellent pitch. When I next hear back from Ketchum reg Exxon (I'm due to
ping them again Monday) I'll put this forward.

Two other things to note: 1) we don't know the client is Exxon, so we need
to gank that, and 2) Are you ok with my clearning this with David and
seeking his feedback?
