Sounds good, and I actually like the starlings vs jumbo jet. I made some
tweaks throughout, but wanted to talk about some larger changes:

Slides 3 & 4 should be one slide with 1-2 sentences.
Slide 9 is too long - 4 items max here.
Slide 10: do we really want to put this on management? Is that encouraging
to them?
Slide 14: can we do a table w/ left vs right?

Thoughts?
