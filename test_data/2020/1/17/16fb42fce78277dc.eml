Can you share this doc so I can edit/make notes?

Overall LOVE the approach, think it's really tangible and hits almost all
of the highlight.

One angle I think we ought to consider is to suggest that in the West the
best place to start getting traction with measuring / deliberately
controlling behavior is in work - it's a big part of our identity, most of
us spend most of our time awake at work, and it leaves the remainder of our
lives to produce emergent positive behavior.

Taking this approach gives us more of a "sanctioned" area to change
people's lives without controlling all of it (OR effecting private/personal
stuff) and lets us position the question with the audience around
how/where/what to do within work... which might produce more interest or
interaction with potential customers or partners.

Thoughts?
