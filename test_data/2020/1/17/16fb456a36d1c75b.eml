Damn, that's amazing. I'd really like to see the profile of one person we
haven't met and then meet them f2f to see how/if the data predicts the
person - already knowing Brian and Theresa makes it hard to know what we're
reading into this.

Given how appealing this is I suggest we have Rivel pay for the whole
thing, but make it clear that it'll be upgrading our entire platform (not
just for them). I don't think they can miss out on it now that they've seen
it!

Why would reporting on the data make emegent phenomena LESS likely?
Especially if we only expose it to management?
