Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support. Due to the custom
shared architecture of the Grid, sub-FTP users with SSH access will only

administrator FTP user,
https://ac.mediatemple.net/services/guide/gs/ftp.mt?id=3D263614.

If you have any further questions regarding your (mt) Media Temple
services, please feel free to contact us at any time.
