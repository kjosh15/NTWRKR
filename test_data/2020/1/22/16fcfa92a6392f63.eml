Hi,

Thank you for your interest in the program. We just wanted to let you know
that we are at capacity for the Spring ECI and have started a wait list. If
you would like to join the wait list, please let us know. We do still have
space in the ICI (May 10-15). If you would like to reserve a spot in the
ICI, please make a deposit through our website. Below is a note from our
program director about the difference between the ECI and ICI.
Additionally, we have recently posted links on our site for upcoming
information sessions.

*Difference Between ECI and ICI*
The content for ECI and ICI is largely the same, in that we introduce and
practice the same approach grounded in three research-based foundations
(principles, competencies, and process), what is different is: (a) the
profile of the participants (the "internals" are mainly employed by an
organization, plan to practice coaching in their current organization, also
interested not only in developing coaching skills, yet also focused on
integrating coaching with other organizational systems or practices, where
as the "externals" are generally either self-employed or work for an
"external client facing" function such as consulting, relationship manager,
account executive and so on - the externals are much more likely to want to
focus on the "business of coaching" as well as the skills set.

In short, the content is largely the same, what is different is the focus,
nature of the questions, and emphasis of the conversation both in class and
during non-formal interactions. Another difference is, the "internals" are
generally sponsored by their organizations, and as such, based on prior
feedback, we have a "ground rule" of not soliciting business from one
another during the program and keep the focus on learning. Prior ICI
participants have made it clear that they want to be learners during the
week not vendors. So, if this option makes sense to you it is important to
adhere to this agreement. Whether you attend ECI or ICI, if you decide to
continue with the next stage of the program, the field-based practicum, we
begin to integrate externals and internals in various ways during that 8 -
 9 month periods, so externals electing to attend ICI often can get their
need met. If you have not already done so, you can learn more about the
program by attending an online information session, you can gain more
clarity about the difference during those sessions.
