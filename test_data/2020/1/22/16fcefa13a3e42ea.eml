Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support. You may develop the
site on a subdomain or a placeholder domain that is not registered which
you may access via site preview as described  at
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204643190/how-can-i-test-or=
-preview-my-website-before-switching-dns.
When ready to go live, the domain directory where you developed the site
and the existing site need be updated and if using a domain dependent CMS,
