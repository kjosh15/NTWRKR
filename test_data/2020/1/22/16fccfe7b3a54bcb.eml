Don=E2=80=99t think I sent you notes - I made a few minor tweaks to the dec=
k but
couldn=E2=80=99t see any structural changes that wouldn=E2=80=99t sacrifice=
 the narrative
you were after, particularly in slides 3 & 4. As we=E2=80=99re going to wal=
k
through it for them let=E2=80=99s keep it as it is and I can make edits aft=
er based
on Bechtel=E2=80=99s response.

Curious to see how serious they are and what they respond to!!
