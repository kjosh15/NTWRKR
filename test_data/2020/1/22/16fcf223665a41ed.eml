Very cool! So hilarious to see a piece about Bainbridge - I grew up in
Seattle and it was never regarded as a tech hub... :)

I'm still doing various projects; I was recently asked about doing work on
digital strategy for the Biden campaign, and have a microtargeting
opportunity around real estate I'm trying to figure out. You know, the
usual weird shit.

Keep me posted and let me know if I can ever be of any help!
