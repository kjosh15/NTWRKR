Good talking to you, and stoked to hear about the pilot. I=E2=80=99ll be cu=
rious to
hear how you crack the nut of getting access to Tech Corp channels like
Netflix and Amazon as everyone I=E2=80=99ve spoke to has said they=E2=80=99=
re deeply
impenetrable. If anyone can figure that out you will.

Feel free to suggest a time for a followup call or just give me a ring; I
forgot to ask what Zane is up to nowadays as I always find it shocking that
he=E2=80=99s essentially an adult. For some reason he was the prototype for=
 =E2=80=9Ckid of
friend with kid=E2=80=9D for me, so I eternally recall him as elbow high an=
d
precocious.

You got pulled away before I got a chance to mention that traditional
channels are now accepting branded content in a whole new way, and I=E2=80=
=99m in a
weird position in that I have access to brands (or at least senior leaders
at big ones.) I know that=E2=80=99s for documentaries specifically, but it =
seemed
like the kind of special sauce you=E2=80=99d know how to activate. Let me k=
now if
any bells ring for you.

Otherwise keep me in mind for any weird new things that fall into your
purview: I=E2=80=99d love a chance to work together again! And if I can be =
of any
help to you - either in microtargeting, senior executive mobilizing, or
whatever - please let me know!!

All best,
Josh
