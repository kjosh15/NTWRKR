It was a pleasure catching up - I'm always surprised by the things you've
got in your bag of tricks!! I'd totally forgotten about your financial
management interests, for example...

I'll check out Mr. Flatt - thanks for the tip! In the meantime, I don't
suppose your sister would be up for a coffee or a short call to talk about
her move from TV to board seats, do you? I just did a piece on Bezos' phone
hack and was reminded that there is opportunity in both places. You sister
sounds like she'd have some opinions that might be useful.

Let me know if I can be of any help in your brand-building efforts. I'm
currently relaunching my brand, presskit, and related marketing materials
so am happy to share whatever's useful. Let me know where you're starting
and I'll be happy to suggest.

All best,
Josh
