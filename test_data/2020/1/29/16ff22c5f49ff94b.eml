Crikey - my two sons are already rocketing up; can't imagine what it's like
to see your kids fly off to school somewhere. That's the wonder of
parenting, I guess!

You're a font of thinking yourself, Flint - I really appreciate that you've
got such a purview, esp. given your position in the heart of media creation
and creativity. From where I sit in NYC it's like looking at a VR episode
of Puff the Magic Dragon, with lawsuits and multimedia: hard to understand,
but fascinating.

I've attached the pitch deck for the documentary. The production company
I'm working with has done a nice job, but they don't have contacts on the
OTT side. Based on what I've heard coming out of Cannes and related, now is
the time to push a documentary on one of the big platforms (like Netflix)
in order to get first-mover advantage in creating backwards deal flow for a
corporate sponsor. Do you have any suggestions on who to talk to?

Much obliged and keep me posted,
Josh
