Sounds good. Keep me posted as you continue to build your team - you've got
an interesting challenge in front of you. I'd be keen to help if you ever
need an extra brain!

In the meantime, check out Lisa M. Gray's company soundmindprod.com. Happy
to connect you directly if/when that's of interest.

All best,
Josh
