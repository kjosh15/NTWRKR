Venture.co is a company I've advised since it was just two founders -
they're now doing quite well. They facilitate sale of some pretty
interesting assets and Aaron (one of the founders) was curious if Tovo
could help educate/encourage resellers to learn more about and use their
platform to sell their products. My rought notes below - you game to chat
reg.?

Otherwise I hope the new job is treating you well!!

All best,
Josh

#######

Less than 10k (3500?) people to influence
$4-500mm mostly real estate and energy
Have to educate someone about the apps
Need to get them thinking about alternative assets
Then offer them one
Speed and volume are measurable
   12-14 weeks of getting info to people turning into meetings
Overall conversion is tough (not a vs b)
They=E2=80=99re really good engineers but not marketers
   Info we can give them back is useful
They make 1.5% and give 50% to salespeople
  Could give us 250k on a 100mm deal
See realassetadvisor.com - in their wheelhouse

My summary:

They have a limited base of potential clients (< 10k) who need to be
educated about their class of products. That takes a long time and is very
lossy. If we could target them over time we could (potentially)
significantly improve their deal throughout and take an% of that.
