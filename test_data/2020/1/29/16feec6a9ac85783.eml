Let's just keep the conversation going.  You are always a font of things to
think about.

Zane is a senior at USC. Classics and Philosophy. He's now taller than I
am. No idea what he is going to do with his life.  He's doing piecework for
DARPA.  Gwynna, my daughter who made rare appearances in the day, is a
Freshman at RISD (art college in Rhode Island).

I'm not a documentary maker, but I probably know people who could pull it
off.  Figure out what they'd be interested in and pitch it to them.  My
feeling is that your gift for cybercool is the perfect thing for Executives
who want to look leading edge.

And yeah. Microtargeting something for a sci-fi novel as well as a
fascinating concept.

Create an alternate world for just a few people without their knowing about
it.

Flint
