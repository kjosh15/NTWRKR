Do I have this right that you suggest we pitch:

- Initially demonstrate technology on a deal that:
     is high value
     has an initial pool from which to gather baseline pricing
     has a small final pool to influence
     has 1-3 months runway to execute on
- Based on that, we will begin scaling the technology to automate:
     diagnostics / profiling
     content creation
     deployment
     analytics
- And simultaneously produce:
     technology overview of possibility and impact
     protective diagnostics
     preventative measures recommendations

In exchange for:

- 20% of the company
- Annual salary + benefits
- % of outcome (TBD)

Am I missing anything obvious?

- J
