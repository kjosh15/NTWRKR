CONGRATULATIONS!!!! OMG, this is fabulous news - so many huge congrats.
Clearly you've been busy!! :)

That said, get off the email and go live this amazing experience, and I'll
check back in a few months. All best wishes for a happy healthy birth, and
congrats again!!!

xoxoxo,
Josh

P.S. I'm doing great; two kids, doing more and more executive tech
strategy, may be selling a little Cambridge Analytica engine to Cardi B,
may be doing a tv series on innovation, may be getting sucked up by Google
- as ever, it's all unsure but also all fun. We'll compare notes after the
important stuff (like your giving birth)!!
