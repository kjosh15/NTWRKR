Thanks, Chris! I'm mostly doing work articulating technology innovation
strategy - and the reasons behind the need for it on a tech/market basis -
to senior level execs these days. I'm primarily  curious if KPMG would
benefit from collaborating on that as well as the actual delivery of the
work products. Let me know who is best to connect with over there, and
thanks!

Much obliged,
Josh
