Awesome, thanks! A few questions:

- For State Tax, what quarter am I paying estimated tax for?

- Also, the form allows me to submit tax for New York State AND City Of New
York - does that mean I can pay state and city from this form? What do you
advise?

- In trying to pay federal, it asks me for my SSN. Isn't this tax for the
business? Just want to make sure I'm paying the right thing in the right
place...

Thanks!
- J
