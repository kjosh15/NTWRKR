Sure; I've hosted a few documentary series and in recent conversations with
channel heads at Discovery and Nat Geo have learned that they're more open
to sponsored content than ever before. Most of my work these days is on
retainer to C-suite executives at fortune 400 level companies across a wide
variety of industries, and I'm keen to see if there's some way to merge the
two. Does that interests you / warrant further conversation?

Hope you're well - and where do you live in Barcelona? We lived for a year
near the La Sagrada Familia!
