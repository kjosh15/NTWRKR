So good to catch up!! Loved the conversation, and am curious to hear more
about so many topics... In the meantime, check out the psychometrics
startup we discussed at www.indigometrics.com and feel free to poke at the
demo with the credentials below. Would love to know what you think, esp.
given you view from the heart of silicon valley culture!

Be well,
Josh
