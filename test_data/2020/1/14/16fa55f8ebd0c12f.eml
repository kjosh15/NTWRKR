Pleasure connecting today, as ever! Let me know when you have your deck on
your bundle of renewables together and I'll get it in front of my contacts.

In the meantime, I'd love to hear from Mr. Zell about my commercial real
estate idea, and will see if my friend is interested in approaching Biden.

Many thanks,
Josh
