Would it be possible to get an intro to Glen Hartman and Stacey Jones, both
at Accenture? I met them through you at Brand 50 and Sustainability 50
events respectively.

Aside from the fact that I've been hosting one of Accenture's podcasts, I
just completed a Technology Strategy for a firm in their space and am
curious to compare notes.

Let me know what's possible, and many thanks!

All best,
Josh
