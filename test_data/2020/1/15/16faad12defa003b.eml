Pleasure speaking with you again, as ever. Glad to hear you continue to
land on your feet and that your current ventures are going well.

Let me know if you're able to connect me with Ayisha Kahn, your commercial
real estate friend. I'd be very curious what she thinks of my
microtargeting proposal!

All best wishes,
Josh
