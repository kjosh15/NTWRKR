Andrew,

Thanks again for taking the time to chat today - I learned a ton, and you
were extraordinarily helpful in shaping my thinking around the opportunity
space at Google.

Could you introduce me to Joanna, the senior engineering manager you
suggested in London? I'd love to see what she thinks about my psychometrics
effort.

Similarly, I'd be keen to talk to Bernie Safeheld (sp?) to get his take on
where/if I could be happy at Google.

In the meantime I'll talk with my contacts at globalfuturesgroup.co;
they're the ones that host the Smart Cities conference here in NYC and do
work in this space. My main contact there is mostly working on CIV:LAB.org.
If that looks particularly interesting happy to introduce directly.

Finally, check out Stealing Worlds by Karl Schroeder - it's an interesting
thought piece on distributed sensor networks being made globally available.

Again, I really appreciate the time. Do let me know if I can ever be of
help in any other way!

All best,
Josh
