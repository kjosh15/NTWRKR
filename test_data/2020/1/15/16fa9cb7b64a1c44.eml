BTW we should grab a couple minutes while I'm there to talk about World 50
lunches; they're reaching out to their members to see who will be in NYC in
the next couple months to see if they can create a group of 2-5 members.
They'd like a proposed format from IDEO on something engaging, creative,
and insightful that members could do with IDEO over lunch (~1hr) to try as
a pilot.
