Cool! Best time for me would be the 23rd around lunchtime, or if need be I
could probably move things around for Wednesday. Let me know what works.

Today is totally bonkers scheduling-wise; I could try to give you a quick
call this afternoon around 2:30 or 3, does that work?

All best,
Josh
