Simon,

Long time no speak! I was wondering if you'd be available to speak to a
representative of World 50, an association for senior executives that I
work with. Their Innovating 50 group is comprised of leading innovation
executives that I thought might be interested in learning more about your
work around Smart Cities. Can I connect you with Mike Mudrey, who runs I50?

Many thanks and happy 2020!
- J
