Just spoke to him yesterday - thanks so much!! He=E2=80=99s going to introd=
uce me
to his manager and we=E2=80=99ll see what comes from there. In any case he =
was
exactly the right guy to start with: the work they=E2=80=99re doing is righ=
t in the
bullseye of my interests.

Just our of curiosity, what are the parts that take some doing?

All best and thanks again!!
Josh
