Hey man,

Since I'm leading the eng and product teams, I guess I'd be the best person
to talk to. At the moment, we're pretty focused on growth and market fit
and about to launch our second brand. And to be truly honest, we have some
great advisors/investors and trying to limit our burn with outside
consultants at the moment.

Happy to meet up and talk but not sure if this would lead to a gig in the
near term.
