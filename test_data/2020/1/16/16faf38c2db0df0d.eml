I have a weird one for you; the school my son attends is amazing (diverse,
project led, hugely successful for its students, etc.) but is also TERRIBLE
at corporate outreach. I've suggested we make a video as a means of
introduction to start a conversation with local corporations. Do you know
any CMOs that might be tolerant of a conversation around what said video
should contain? I really don't know where to start but want to add value -
and not waste and local businesspeople's time with content that isn't
useful.

Do you have any suggestions?

Much obliged!
Josh
