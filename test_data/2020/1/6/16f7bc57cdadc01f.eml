In March of 2018 your team (Shekar Krishnan and Gregory Louis) helped our
building (Hayes Court, 33-53 82nd st, Jackson Heights) set up a tenant's
association to fight the new owner's pushing out a lot of existing tenants.
You weren't able to take the case, but the effort helped a bunch of folks
here decide to fight to stay!

We just got new information that may change the picture. In signing our
most recent lease here we discovered that when we moved in Sept 2013 (and
then in our renewal of 2014) we had rent stabilization riders attached (but
not filled out). Our rent history showed the apartment was rent stabilized
from 1984 until 2010, after which all entries were "*REG NOT FOUND FOR
SUBJECT PREMISES*"

Does this things in being able to request a rent stabilization rider going
forward, and/or is this something you can help with (or can suggest someone
who could)?

Many many thanks!!
