Sounds familiar - if you're not doing a ton of different things wtf are you
doing, right?

Really curious to hear more about the acting / voice work you do. I've
hosted three documentary series (and am pitching another to corporate
sponsors now), and done a bunch of VO work (for video games and tv). Have
to admit I fucking loved it - if you're game, I'd love to compare notes!

Keep me posted on this summer; we have a bunch of folks via homeexchange.co=
m
who are interested in trading for points, but we'd love to have folks we
know here!

All best,
Josh

Just wondering, should I (if the unit has it) lower the temperature and ful=

Sorry for all the questions - just want to be precise and have things done =

Hope your travel was smooth an easy!<br>
