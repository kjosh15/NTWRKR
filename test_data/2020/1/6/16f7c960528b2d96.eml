I hope you and yours had a wonderful holiday season. I always feel that the
winter break is a lot like a roller coaster, in that there is a lot of
anticipation, some sheer terror, and then wonder that it's all over
already. A lot like some early relationships I had, but hey...

Let me know if you're game for another short call before things start
getting crazy again. Turns out the IDEO NY office is very very budget
constrained and is going to try to back into the tech strategy over time;
I'm curious if you think the org. as a whole would benefit from a similarly
unified strategy.

Happy happy,
Josh
