Haven't figured out flights yet; I'm happy to do NY either before or after.
I believe you have a pass for the day of the event, and are free to borrow
mine for whatever else you want to see; does that work or do you want to
buy an all access?

I'm on for a call today, although if it's as easy do you mind doing it an
hour later (3pm your time)?
