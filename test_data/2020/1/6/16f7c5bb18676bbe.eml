I=E2=80=99ll send and official intro and CC you on it today. I sent him =
something a while back and he never responded, but it turns out it was =
due to a semi-humorous misunderstanding.

I was at a happy hour with the guy just before the break and he started =
laughing because he thought the email came from a guy on his team =
who=E2=80=99s name is also Josh Higgins (he=E2=80=99s the only other one =
at all of Apple) so he had responded to that guy via Slack and was =
wondering why that guy just didn=E2=80=99t respond further.
