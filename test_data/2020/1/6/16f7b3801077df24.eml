Thanks for this! I made a few tweaks to orient the summary more towards the
content and what the audience can get out of it:

"Big data and analytics are changing how everything operates, from
small-scale companies employing third-party solutions (like the project
management software that obviated project managers) to massive
multinationals who are inheriting systemic algorithmic bias (such as
Cambridge Analytica displayed), and from governments like China and the EU
(who are legislating technology controls in very different ways) to the US
(which basically isn't legislating technology controls at all.)

Josh will provide concrete examples and strategic analysis to show the
myriad ways in which we're under-estimating the potential impact of the
data we're collecting and how it might ultimately be used. From
surreptitious social controls in the workplace to 1984-style "thought
crime" governance, the potential that technology has to change the way
society operates in the very near future has never been so great. Come
learn what we're underestimating and where we can get the most leverage in
what that entails."

Let me know what you think - I'm really excited for this event; do you have
any updates on where our audience will be (in terms of topics of interest,
areas of concern, or hot button issues)?
