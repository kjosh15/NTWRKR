Happy new year! Let me know when would be best to reconnect. I'm keen to
hear more about how you could use this tool, especially as we continue to
build out the qualitative reporting capabilities.

All best,
Josh

<br>
To answer a few points directly as discussed on the call:<br>
<br>
- We have quite a lot of experience working with participants that do not h=
ave a company email address. It requires us to keep on top of our SPF recor=
ds to minimize transfer to junk email but apart from that it works seamless=
ly.<br>
<br>
- We have found that we can accurately and consistently measure and quantif=
y any observable behavior. That matches well with the needs of an oil and g=
as company in that:<br>
=C2=A0<br>
a. Because it uses peer observation of behaviors (rather than management ob=
servation) it is well suited to distributed workforces and workforces that =
often operate out of sight of management.<br>
<br>
b. IndigoMetrics simplifies the process of behavior assessment to collect d=
ata in as short a time and in as enjoyable a way as possible by mimicking o=
nline survey UX patterns. This means that it&#39;s highly effective with wo=
rkforces that may be traditionally wary
 of behavioral systems or surveys. Examples of such workforces include spor=
ts teams and =E2=80=9Cblue collar=E2=80=9D workforces.<br>
<br>
c. IndigoMetrics has far greater reach than traditional management approach=
es and is able to provide consistent data across large oil and gas workforc=
es which can act as an early warning of future challenges and to provide di=
rection for ongoing training programs.<br>
