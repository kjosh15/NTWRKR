My card has been revoked. I confirmed my credit card information for both
cards, and tried to make a one-time payment with my primary card and was
told:

"There may be a problem with the Information you entered. Please Contact

My Account Number is 5100000905300. Why was my card denied?

Thanks!
Josh
