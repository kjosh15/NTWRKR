Is it just me or do the winter holidays get more jam-packed every year? I
keep thinking Halloween is around the corner and then <MEATGRINDER> it's
after new years'!

Let me know when you're game for a short call; I wanted to hit:

- Smart Cities
- IDEO lunches
- Another crazy idea I'm curious to get your take on

Happy 2020...
- J
