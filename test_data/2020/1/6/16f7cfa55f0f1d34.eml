Hello Josh, happy 2020!

I'm Monica Sack, Head of Programming Advancement for the SXSW Conference,
and I wanted to take a moment to say thanks so much for being a speaker at
our upcoming event. The world feels a bit overwhelming at the moment, but
having you be a part of SXSW helps remind us that there are incredible
people sharing creative ideas and inspiring positive change. Thank you so
much for contributing to our community.

To that end, I would like to invite you to our SXSW Speaker Workshop. This
is the 5th year that we're holding a workshop in the NYC area as this great
city keeps showcasing extraordinary speakers at our event.

This workshop is meant to accomplish a few different things: give speakers
a chance to talk and learn from one another (newbies and veterans alike),
get a better understanding of best practices, and ask any questions you
have about the event (big or small). While completely optional, speakers
who've attended in the past have found it both extremely helpful and
inspiring.

For New York, we'll be holding two different workshops so you have some
scheduling options. The content of these will be the same. Please RSVP at
following invite links:

*Thursday, January 16* at Candid:

*Friday, January 17* at Town Stages (who doesn't want end the week hanging
out with awesome people?!):

Lastly, if you're getting this email but you do NOT live in the New York
area, then we should probably update that. Feel free to email me your new
contact information. If you are getting this email but are unaware of your
speaking engagement, please let me know ASAP so we can sort things out.

Thanks, and hope to see you soon!
