100%, I can and would like to commit to all of August... still trying to
work out if July is possible... do you have a deadline for your scheduling?

The acting stuff isn't as glamorous (yet) as I'd like it to be, lol.
My comedy life lead me to meeting an amazing voice actor who basically told
me that "the weird impressions and voices" I do can actually make me money.

It's very "part time" for me... I've done the voice of Jesus for faith
based cartoons in Florida that I've never seen, robot voices, and have been
"on hold" for a bunch of narrator positions for documentaries but they
never tell me why they chose the other person so I am still hackin away at
the craft.

The big thing for me has been voice doubling Schwarzenegger... it was my
main impression for a while and in 2013 a video of me went viral and ever
since, I've been doing voice overs as him for all types of projects ranging
from weird phone calls to a business event... all the way to voicing a live
action robot head on a tank that looks like him.... it's definitely been a
fun ride but I've always been afraid of being completely broke as an artist
so I always had a day job building.

How did you like hosting the shows? Would love to know what that was like
for you?
I've always been interested in jobs like that but I find that the hosts are
typically a specialist along the lines of topic within the series... which
means I should be the host of a documentary of "construction workers that
speak in weird voices to make their co-workers laugh while working."
