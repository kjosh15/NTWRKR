Happy new year! I hope you made it through the holiday gauntlet unscathed;
we spent a week snowed in with my in-laws in a tiny cabin in Iceland, which
was gorgious but also very dark...!

Just checking in to see if that Health Products R&D Team contact panned out
- they sound like a really sweet spot in the org for my interests. I got to
do a bunch of interesting work in the healthcare space while working on
IDEO's Technology Strategy, specifically around embedded sensors,
quantified systems, and healthcare integration.

Many many thanks!
Josh
