Had an idea last night: what if we pitched a campaign for Amtrak connecting
riders to every national park on a circuit? Riders could overnight on
trains between parks, then camp and hike in the parks themselves, and then
train to the next one. They could start anywhere in the circuit and collect
the usual patches, etc. along the way.

Use of national parks is WAY up as people look for cheap stuff to do,
there's an increase in interest in more sustainable travel, and the train
system could use the ridership - maybe even enough to do a revshare with
parks. The existing administration could use the PR, esp. among the kinds
of folks who camp in parks. What do you think?

Hope you're well - let me know if you're around for a call before the new
year gets crazy!!!

All best,
Josh
