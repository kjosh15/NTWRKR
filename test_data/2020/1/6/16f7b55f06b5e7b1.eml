Happy new year!! I hope you made it through the holiday meat grinder
unscathed. ;)

I'm writing with a request: you're my only connection to the demolition
derby world, and my youngest is getting increasingly crazy about cars. Do
you have any recommendations?

All best wishes for 2020,
Josh
