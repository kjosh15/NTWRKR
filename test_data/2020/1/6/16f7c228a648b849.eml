By Friday you were going to:

1. Get confirmation on how effectively we could target a specific,
high-value user (who is educated, affluent, and unlikely to suffer
clickbait),
2. Get pricing for same,
3. Get an estimate on who we'd need to build a small, nimble team to
execute on the above.

You were also waiting to hear from someone about cultural influence so we
can make a good pitch to Cardi B. Just want to make sure you're not
dropping any balls while juggling the Stormey thing. (Did you see what I
did there?!?)

All best - and stoked about this improving approach to getting clients on
this work!!
Josh
