I just finished developing IDEO's Technology Strategy for their NY office
and really enjoyed working on a variety of brands and projects while I was
there. Outside of building the strategy, my remit was to:

a) assist in Business Development (as I have a pretty good network, mostly
to senior-level executives around technology innovation and special
projects),
b) produce thought leadership to define a specific view on existing and
emerging tech,
c) advise and help build the emerging tech side of their projects, esp.
around data and analytics.

I had a blast, but felt like there was - yet again - a lack of meaning in
the products we created. It was making shit for the sake of selling it,
without consideration of what the products would do to change the lives of
their users. It was backwards to what the world seems to be asking for,
which is stuff which leads our lives forwards vs stuff jamming itself
backwards into our lives.

Everything I've read about Gin Lane and Pattern seems to show that you guys
are interested in changing the world by changing how we interface with
brands, and that's something I've never seen before and would like to see
happen.

Does that help?
