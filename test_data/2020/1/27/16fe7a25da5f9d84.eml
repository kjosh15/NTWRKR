Josh,

Thanks for contacting Media Temple support!

I successfully processed the $36.00 payment, so your balance is now $0. This means your h4xindustries.com and ghettosommelier.com domain registrations will automatically renew in February. Also, all new charges moving forward will be processed automatically using the primary card on file assuming the card isn't declined for some reason.

If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this support request or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you.

Best regards,

Andrew U.
