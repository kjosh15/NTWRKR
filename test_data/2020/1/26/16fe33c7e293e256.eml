Jazz working at city of Stockton (no longer at sales force) but auditioned
with them on a thought leadership position; Myles introduced me?

Cultivate both for hiring and sales

Buy ads for all mid-level execs
   Then spot to see if someone is outbidding
   That is an tripwire
   Use feeds to upskill values you want
