Josh,

Dear Josh,

We recently notified you that one or more domains you've registered with Media Temple are due for renewal soon. We have not yet received payment for these domain renewals, which means they will expire.

AFFECTED SERVICES
Domain:  h4xindustries.com
Expiration date: 2020-02-05
Balance due: $18.00



WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
If you want to renew these domains rather than letting them expire, please log in to your Account Center as soon as possible to make sure your payment information is up to date and to clear your unpaid balance. 
https://ac.mediatemple.net/billing/manage_cards.mt

Thanks again for being a Media Temple customer. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or need help.
