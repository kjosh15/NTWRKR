Okidokie - I'll give it a couple more tries.

I do residential homes of all shapes and sizes (renovations and full
builds)... I specified in the wood framing aspect of the build but the past
few months I've switched to managing sites so I can keep my body healthy as
I age but also so I have the energy to perform Stand-up at night and not
have to rely on coffee lol.

We had a fun night with Michael and Zoe, kept it low key! Hope you guys had
fun too!

And thank you for sharing your place with us, it's been super duper awesome=
!

-Dave
