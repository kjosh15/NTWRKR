The mailbox is just super janky - try putting it in only as far as needed
to get it to turn; the super replaced it and didn=E2=80=99t do a very good =
job. :/

Curious about your house building - are you doing custom homes, large scale
buildings, or...?

Hope you had a great new year - thanks again for taking care of our place
and our cats!!!
