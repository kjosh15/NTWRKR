Wanted to give some quick notes about Corning based on what may not have
been readily apparent:


   - Corning is deeply siloed, both geographically and functionally
   - buying tends to be similarly siloed (and hence political)
   - IT is the hardest to get to the table; getting folks like Jeff on
   board brings you closer
   - IT will be the gatekeepers (as nobody else will want to take the risk
   of being wrong)
   - If you can get Cheryl to buy into it IT will fall in line


I'll ping them again next week to see if Jeff has actually moved things
forward and push him to schedule another call a week after - they tend to
be hard to get on the calendar but once there they usually do respect the
date, so it's good to prompt them to schedule in advance.

Otherwise you were AMAZING on this call and handled Jeff's questions like a
champ. I didn't have anything to add because you covered it all so well,
but I've got a rich backchannel with Neda (who tends to explain things to
other staff members who are less technical) and will do my best to keep
things moving on that front.

In the meanwhile let me know what else I can do to support; so far it
sounds like there's good opportunity here!

All best,
Josh
