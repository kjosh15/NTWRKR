Once I'm showering regularly I'll start thinking about a switch. First
things first. ;)

Things here are pretty much the same; we go for walks in the morning and
afternoon, kids play and do classes during the day, etc. etc. etc. The
weirdest thing is that usually this time of year I'm flying around the
world (I was supposed to be in Paris giving a talk yesterday, for example)
and instead I'm ... here. Glad to be having the time with family, but it's
still weird.

How about you? How's your business, and how are you feeling about the
virus/safety?
