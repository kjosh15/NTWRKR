As ever, a great pleasure to speak with you earlier today. I was
particularly eye-opened when you reminded me about all the significant
viruses of the past few decades and saw how my own bias was shielding me
from taking them seriously. The point that we're going to be facing
potential pandemics ongoing from here can't be understated, but perhaps
equally as daunting is our own resistance to accepting this fact. :/

In terms of topics, if we're looking to use the role of innovation (or a
"hacking mindset") as a framework, why don't we talk about:

- How Innovation has always been a part of business (and how it's not
strictly technical)
- Why COVID-19 has suddenly made innovation more visible
- What characterizes "good" (effective) vs "bad" (costly and misguided)
innovation/hacking
- Major risk areas for companies reacting with contraction in the face of
the crisis
- Major opportunity spaces opened up by the virus
   ; I'd want to hit quantification of human behavior here
- How innovation as a core function can be systemically inculcated company
wide

These are broad buckets - we should narrow these down a bit and then pull
out a couple of examples under each which we can prompt each other with.
Before that, though, do you think these buckets are right? What are we
missing / would be interesting specifically for this audience?

Many many thanks again for the invite,
Josh
