Had a good informational interview with a friend who worked at Chef.io (see
below). His take is:

a) Look at infrastructure management tools for further out on the roadmap:

Terraform.io, CloudFormation, and Chef.io are all recommended

Here's a good overview:
https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-=
saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c

b) We should look at application-only solutions, like AWS Fargate or AWS
Lambda, as alternatives to setting up and maintaining a full VM.

c) We'll need to look within each cloud ecosystem to see what each has for
off the shelf security offerings. For example, AWS has its own firewall
service:

alternately, if we end up deploying full VM's:

d) There are a number of AWS-native security apps (not surprisingly):

https://www.exam-labs.com/blog/top-7-most-significant-tools-to-explore-aws-=
security

I'd suggest we make some decisions about our architecture going forward -
for example, if we only roll out a front-end application for clients to
host on their own (and thereby offer no security), OR deploy an application
only w/in a secured cloud environment that changes our threat profile and
assurances significantly.

Thoughts?
