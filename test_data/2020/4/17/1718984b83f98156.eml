Hey Josh I hope you guys are doing well over there,=20

You and everybody is trying to figure it out what to write about during a pa=
ndemic,  including the place I work for. Most desks have moved to mostly cor=
onavirus-focused articles because that=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s happening ri=
ght now and there is a great hunger for it. That said, we are also finding t=
hat non-virus related stories, those that are perhaps more escapist, about c=
ultural things, cooking, house and home/domestic thing, for example, are get=
ting a lot of interest too. And things that aren=E2=80=99t necessarily coron=
avirus centered but about the challenges or issues of around living at home a=
nd isolating.=20

We are constantly trying to answer the same question that you=E2=80=99re ask=
ing me, we=E2=80=99re generally taking a double-pronged approach: Looking at=
 Google trends and what kind of stories are doing well (seeing what people a=
re searching for and looking at which of our own articles are getting traffi=
c for ideas on which subjects people are interested in ); and secondly getti=
ng ahead of that and attempting to coming up with something that seems fresh=
. A new angle, or it=E2=80=99s just interesting news.=20

There=E2=80=99s been a big lean into service journalism during this time, ar=
ticles that help readers do something, cope with something, figure something=
 out, explain something, navigate some thing or some system etc. A lot of th=
em fall under the =E2=80=9Csmarter living=E2=80=9C rubric on the New York Ti=
mes, but right now almost every section is writing them.=20

I am not familiar with what you=E2=80=99ve written, but I=E2=80=99m looking a=
t your page now to see if there=E2=80=99s anyone I could recommend or connec=
t you with. I=E2=80=99m happy to connect you in any way, if I possibly can. B=
ut it=E2=80=99s most meaningful if you have a specific article idea you want=
 to pitch.=20

That=E2=80=99s what it=E2=80=99s gonna come down to, one article that they l=
ike and publish. Then they know you and the next one is 100x easier.=20

=46rom what I know, you might be able to write in the zone where technology a=
nd privacy cross. Writing about technology and computer science, hacking, et=
c. in a way that is meaningful and understandable to the layperson is very v=
aluable. If you can do it.  I think you have a wide berth since technology a=
nd computers are prevalent across nearly all areas of life. I=E2=80=99d also=
 think about how things will change going forward after this experience and h=
ow that relates to your area of expertise.=20

The New York Times is a news organization. At the very basic level they=E2=80=
=99re looking for something that is pertinent right now. I=E2=80=99ve heard m=
any pitches answered with =E2=80=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s the news=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s new here?=E2=80=9D

Ok, that just off the top of my head I don=E2=80=99t know how useful it is t=
o you.

If you have a specific idea let me know and I=E2=80=99ll see if I can get it=
 to somebody who might be interested. A blind introduction with nothing to o=
ffer is not very useful or memorable to an editor.  you have to have somethi=
ng in hand, even if they don=E2=80=99t use it. let me know  I=E2=80=99m not s=
ure how much power I have, but it=E2=80=99ll cut through at least a layer or=
 two. =20

Best, Michael
