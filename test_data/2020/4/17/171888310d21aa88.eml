Hey all, two things:

1) I just invited you to see my working calendar (busy/free only) and would
ask you share same with Hulda and I. That way we can all take a look at
when we're committed or available in making our schedules going forward.

2) Is everyone ok with either changing the use of the Ella Baker calendar
or making a new shared calendar to lay out who is responsible for the group
of kids when? That way we can all plan out our coming weeks communally.

Let me know if anyone has any better / other ideas!

- J
