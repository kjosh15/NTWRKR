Hmmm, let me think on this. Probably a better phone conversation. I have
time to chat tomorrow if you want.

As far as Covid, it was pretty bad for about a week (extreme fatigue, fever
[luckily never more than 100.5], chest pressure, and a dry cough), and then
the fatigue really lingered (still lingering for Jason). Luckily I have a
pulse oximeter, so I was able to check my levels and they never dipped
below 96. The freakiest was the chest pressure and the extreme fatigue.
Jason and I are having tests at Mt. Sinai on Tuesday to see if we have
enough antibodies to donate plasma. Keeping our fingers crossed!

So let me know if you want to chat on Saturday! I'm not going anywhere. Ha.
Ann
