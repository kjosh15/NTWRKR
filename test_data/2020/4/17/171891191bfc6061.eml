Holy smokes!! So glad to hear you're doing better. Was it as brutal for you
as some people seem to experience it?

Really I'm just looking for the same thing any other "thought leader"
consultant is - platforms to sound smart on so we can reference ourselves
to / find potential clients. Know any podcasts that are either a) hiring
talent that can talk tech AND business, or b) looking for tech-smart
luminaries to interview/discuss topics with?

One big thing is that tech innovation is happening at a CRAZY rate because
of this virus, and that spells opportunity and risk for most businesses.
That's where I'm putting most of my chips in terms of brand.

As ever, any advice appreciated. Can I do anything to help you guys??
