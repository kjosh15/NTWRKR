Hi Josh,

Would you be available for a video chat on Tuesday at 7 for a first tenants
association meeting?

*- How are you aggregating responses, and where/how can we see them?*
We have so far gotten contacted by about eight apartments, and have only
collected apartment-related concerns from two or three tenants. We now have
a survey
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9davHqXFG6-7ceD63r4w4l-qyZqUnNq=
dB2r7_4qryU7eOZw/viewform?usp=3Dsf_link>that
will help us collect all the answers into a spreadsheet. Today through
Monday we are knocking on doors to collect survey responses in-person. We
received a key from Noah for entrances to buildings A through D. We=E2=80=
=99ll also
share the responses via spreadsheet.

Since you both already answered most of the questions, we can input your
answers ourselves. The questions about privacy though are important -- can
you answer these two?:
- Would you like to be connected with the neighbors in your building line?
(For example, if you live in E22, we will share your first name, pronouns,
apartment unit, and email address with members in all the "E" apartments.)
--> we got this idea from you actually. Not sure if you are connected with
all tenants in B yet.
- Can we share your concerns (regarding management) with other members of
the tenants association? (If yes: anonymously or with your first name
attached?)
- Are you interested in helping neighbors if they require COVID-19 support?
(yes/maybe/no)

*- Have you connected with the previous tenant's union? Sandra Fell was
instrumental to this and may have some good feedback. *
We had a nice video chat with Noah and Sandra on Monday. They told us the
history of the tenants association and the management. They are in the
process of updating their contacts sheet and sharing some other folders
with us.

*- Is there a list or timeline for getting everyone signed on that's
publicly available so that everyone can help fill in the gaps?*
Noah's contact list is more than half full, but hasn't been updated in 1 or
2 years. He's updating this week. His contacts haven't given him permission
to be contacted by us, so we are asking Noah to reach out to them digitally=
.
As mentioned we are knocking on all doors this weekend. i will try to share
our list of no-response apartment units by tomorrow night.

*- Do you have any legal support or resourcing so participants know what
we're working with as a group?*
We're very familiar with justfix.nyc and we're excited that you know them!
I requested our rent history through them. Their website is great.
Sandra has a couple contacts that she would like to share with us, but we
have none yet. We're also putting together a folder of key resources that
give tenants a clear idea of their rights, as well as legal documents
relating to the building that are publicly available. So far this includes
things like heat regulations, maintenance requirements, our rights to
withhold rent, rights as rent-stabilized tenants, how to get (and read)
your rent history, Department of Buildings violations, the deed and
certificates of occupancy for the buildings, etc. This being pulled from
NYC records, activist organizations (such as Housing Justice for All), and
other tenant organizations (such as Crown Heights Tenants' Union). We
currently do not have a legal contact but would be keen to get in touch
with someone if you or anyone else knows a housing lawyer. If you have
other thoughts on resources we might need, please let us know!

Best,
Jay/Bri/Milo
E22
