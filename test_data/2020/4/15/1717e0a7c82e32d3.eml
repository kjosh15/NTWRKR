Sure, I'd love to! Thank you so much for thinking of me. Very interesting
to see where Carlos ended up; Katalyst seems like a super interesting idea.

Glad to hear you're doing well - at some point if you're curious would love
to catch up on a call to compare notes. I'm ten minutes from the epicenter
of the epicenter here in NYC, watching the crisis unfold up close and
personal.

Entirely separately, I'd love to get your thoughts on growing a network in
the EU; based on how the next presidential election goes we're considering
finally making the move... Cutting WHO funding in the middle of a global
pandemic was one negative indicator too many.
