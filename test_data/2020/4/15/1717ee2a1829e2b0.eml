Give this a shot; could be that you have just one client with incorrect
passwords and that's triggering their block.

Josh,

Thank you for contacting Media Temple!

I double-checked our mail server logs, and found that there have been
multiple failed login attempts by the email address chris@indigometrics.com
at the IP address 94.13.30.140. This led to our security systems blocking
that IP address, in case it was a hacking attempt.

Chris can check the IP address at his location by visiting this website:
https://ipchicken.com/
If it is different than 94.13.30.140, please let us know!

Chris will need to re-enter the password for both incoming and outgoing
servers in all email clients at that IP address, such as Apple Mail,
Outlook, or Thunderbird, including any phones which are set up for email as
well. Once the failed login attempts stop, the IP address blocking should
no longer happen, and any active blocks should clear out within 2 hours.

If re-entering the passwords doesn't help, please let us know and we'll
take a look again!

Please let us know if you have any questions!

For further assistance, please contact us by replying to this support
request through the Media Temple Account Center, or by calling us at
310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you!

Best regards,
