If we get in the habit of updating the account often we can post the latest
on the bottom of the main site page. Otherwise we can include a link to the
twitter account from the bottom of the page, which might be better in case
we don't frequently update.

Do you want to try to add to it more frequently over the next few weeks and
see if it becomes a habit? I can commit to trying this so we can see if we
hit critical mass.
