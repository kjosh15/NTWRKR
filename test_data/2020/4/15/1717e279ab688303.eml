Sounds good. I got fliers to B41, B32, B22, and B01. I think B31 is empty,
and don't know about B21.

A couple quick questions;

- How are you aggregating responses, and where/how can we see them?
- Have you connected with the previous tenant's union? Sandra Fell was
instrumental to this and may have some good feedback.
- Is there a list or timeline for getting everyone signed on that's
publicly available so that everyone can help fill in the gaps?
- Do you have any legal support or resourcing so participants know what
we're working with as a group?

Really excited to see this happening - thanks so much!

- J
