BTW, not sure if it's useful or not, but I know the founders of
Justfix.nyc. If we're looking to unify our community's actions in
requesting service from the owners this might be a good way to do it.

They give you a form to list everything wrong with your apartment and send
the request via certified mail to make a legally binding record in case of
backlash or delay on the part of the landlord. If everyone at Hayes Ct.
submitted these at once it'd be a pretty powerful record for use in
negotiating. Further, it might be a kind of group action the folks at
JustFix.nyc would want to help support as a case study. Just a thought!

All best,
Josh
