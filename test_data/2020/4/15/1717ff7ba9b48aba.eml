the challenges businesses face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sponsored by the County of Maui, the COVID-19 Business Assistance

which are the backbone of our economy" says Leslie Wilkins, President
and CEO of Maui Economic Development Board. "MEDB's business
development team is working to bring businesses access to
up-to-the-minute information. The webcasts and one-on-one guidance

applications to generate much needed cash resources."

owners determine their eligibility for which programs, with clear
step-by-step instructions. As a service to the community in these
uncertain times, the webcasts are free of charge. Guest speakers are

Dan O'Connell (standing right) founder and
CEO of HNu Photonics.

Mayor Michael Victorino recently announced $100,000 in grant funds to
Maui Economic Development Board Inc. (MEDB) for local production of
emergency ventilators to treat COVID-19.

"This is very good news!" said Victorino. "Ventilators are crucial
when it comes to effectively caring for COVID-19 patients, so having
these companies producing them on island is a true blessing for our
community. We also want to mahalo MEDB and the two companies for
their partnership in producing these ventilators."

The two locally-owned technology companies are immediately
redeploying their engineering and machining capabilities to
manufacture the ventilators on Maui. Maui Innovation Group, led by
Dr. Ned Davis at the Maui Research and Technology Park, is currently
developing breakthrough magnetic valve technology at the U.S. Air
Force Academy. HNu Photonics, led by Dr. Dan O'Connell of Kahului,
presently has their Maui-built biolab in orbit on the International
Space Station.

Isar Mostafanezhad presents at Maui TechOhana
On February 6, more than 30 Maui tech entrepreneurs braved the rain
to come listen to, and ask questions of, the guest speaker at the
latest Maui TechOhana. Dr. Isar Mostafanezhad, the founder of Oahu
company Nalu Scientific, came to Maui to share his business model
secrets using Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grants.

Presented by Maui Economic Development Board (MEDB), Maui TechOhana
is a regular networking event with a guest speaker from the tech
industry to talk story on their career path, lessons learned and
relevant topics.

Mostafanezhad shared his story of developing an advanced microchip
specifically to solve a problem for the U.S. Government. "The US
Government has the Small Business Innovative and Research program.
Research and Development is very capital intensive - you need to have
a good design team, you need to fabricate it, test it, etc. It's a
very lengthy process, and risky. But the government needs this
product, and it's not available, so they are prepared to foot the
bill for research and development."
