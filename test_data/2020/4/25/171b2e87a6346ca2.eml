Turns out I need this in order to submit my PPP form to Kabbage, which was
now recommended over GetDivvy (the first place I used) and noncompetitive
with same. CapitalOne (my business account bank) is not yet even accepting
submissions. I may try Lendio also, as they're supposed to be quicker still
for sole proprietors, and to hell with the potential collision risk - the
money will just go too fast.

That said, this means I'm going to eyeball the Schedule C and hope it comes
out OK. If that's a really, really bad idea let me know!

All best,
Josh
