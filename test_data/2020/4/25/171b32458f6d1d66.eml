I completed the entire form, including validating my bank account details,
and was told more information was needed about my submission. But when I
clicked through, it simply said that "Kabbage is reviewing your
application."

I know you guys are inundated with requests, and that the SBA PPP loans are
going super fast. I don't want my submission held up; can you confirm that
everything that's required is available?

Thanks!
Josh Klein
