We're doing ok, planning to go to Iceland this summer. If school doesn't
come back in the fall I have no idea what our plans are; the entire draw of
NYC has been the business network (all f2f) and community (i.e., school and
neighbors), so enduring all the discomfort and hassle of NYC in lockdown
may not be worth it. The question then being... where is?

I was doing some writing this morning about it all and the fact that there
is so incredibly much uncertainty - and will be for quite a while. It's
staggering, and so difficult to imagine, let alone plan, for the future we
are facing. In many ways that's my raison d'etre - imagining what to do
with massive change - but living it at this scale takes a toll.

How about you? You've been trained to deal with situations of huge
complexity and uncertainty; how are you managing?
