Hi Hulda & Josh,

Sorry for the delay, it=E2=80=99s been a very intense week with work and =
too many zooms and emails.

In short, for now I would say that might be a possibility as I finish =
here at the end of May. =20
But I have places to stay until July and may need to get out of the city =
anyway.   So I wouldn=E2=80=99t necessarily ask for that or book =
anything until we speak at the end of the month, if that=E2=80=99s okay. =
 I just need to get through the next week or so to think more fully.

I was also wondering if you have pictures of the apt that you could =
send?

all best
david
