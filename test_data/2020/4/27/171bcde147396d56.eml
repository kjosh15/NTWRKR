OK, so I've been sharing this with some friends who seem to think it's
super valuable and should be shared more widely, but I have no idea where.
Do you think either of those things are true? It's essentially a really
simple framework for thinking through whether you should leave your city
during a crisis.

XXXXXXX

I spoke several weeks ago with a very talented analyst friend (who is also
a big pessimist - but clearly smarter than I about it!) He suggested a
simple framework for predicting/managing worst-case scenarios:

1) Consider bugging out if you see:

widespread infection / absenteeism in fire dept. and police force.
widespread stoppage of delivery trucks to enter city
striking by anyone in the food chain in the NYC area
significant loss of fundamental services (like electricity, phone, heat,
etc.)

2) In each case, use the following matrix to decide when/if to leave:

a) do you know WHY? (I.e, why the power went out?)
If not, trigger a next level response (i.e., flee)

b) If so, is the power outage local, regional, or national?
If > local, then trigger a next level response

I.e., if a significant drop in livability happens but you can't readily
determine why, there's systemic failure that is potentially dangerous.
Similarly, if the same happens and you know why, but it's affecting more
than a local level, then that too is evidence of systemic failure that is
potentially dangerous.

Hopefully this is useful - it comprises the bulk of what I've been looking
out for since the beginning of the pandemic.
