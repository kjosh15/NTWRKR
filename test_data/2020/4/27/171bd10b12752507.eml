Laura,

Thanks again for inviting me to this group - what an awesome group of
people!! Two things:

1) As mentioned in my last call we're making our platform available to
select clients. After I spoke to my business partner we've agreed to make
it available to anyone in this network - it just seems like everyone you've
brought into it are looking to create a net positive global impact. Those
are the kinds of people we want to work with.

IndigoMetrics uses short (less than 3 minute long) surveys to create a
statistical model of the behavior and beliefs of employees. We've found
that remote employees particularly find this useful in knowing
how/where/what to do to collaborate better with their peers. Happy to
explain the platform (www.indigometrics.com) in detail to anyone who is
interested - let me know if there is a better way to offer this to the
people in this network!

2) Rodriguez and Jason Jannati both seem to be working on smart city
initiatives; I've got a number of contacts in this space and would love to
see if I could help them.

Many thanks again,
Josh
