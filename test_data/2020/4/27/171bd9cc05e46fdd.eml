Hi Neighbors!

Thank you so much for offering to volunteer and help your neighbors in
need. As of right now, we haven't received very many requests for urgent
aid needs. We will be contacting those who have said they would volunteer
for helping with *laundry* specific needs after this email, so please check
if you volunteered for that.

For now, we would like to ask anyone with *Spanish speaking/translation*
ability to help us create a version of the Covid survey in Spanish. We are
concerned that many of those we spoke with initially who have expressed a
need for aid haven't reached out due to the language barrier. If you have
the ability to help us with this task, please reach out as soon as possible
as this is an urgent matter.

We plan to email out Covid Volunteer updates on an as-needed basis so do
not expect a weekly update.

Thank you all again,

Your Neighbors/Hayes Court United
