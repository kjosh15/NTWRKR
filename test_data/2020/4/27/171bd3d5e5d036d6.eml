First. I'm glad to get this. It is elegant and thought provoking. And
somehow calming and still a touch alarmist at the same time. So that's
impressive.

It might spread as a tweet or WhatsApp forward. But not sure it would fit
the bill to publish in a way you were hoping to do.

I don't know that I'd personally share it widely or publish it. As a media
org representative, I want collective action solutions. With this, I'd
worry about a bankrun mentality for fleeing. The spirit of this seems to be
to flee before others flee. Rational I guess. But then, smartest plan is
flee ASAP. Why even wait.

And flee to where? How do you know the destination is safer/better? Or that
we as a society will be better able to get through the crisis once we've
fled?

There is probably a companion flow chart / program that is about why
staying is better and the benefits of staying.

AG
