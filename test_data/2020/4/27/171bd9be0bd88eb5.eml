Hello!

If you are receiving this email, you have said you wanted to be more
involved in the association. We are hoping to get more help with some
organizing as we are just not able to do all this work alone!

If you are able to, please reach out to us in the next few days if you are
able to help out with the following projects:

*Building Captains/Accessibility:*
We need some help making sure the documents, surveys, emails, etc. are able
to be accessed by everyone in our building. We want to make sure everyone
is able to read the information we are trying to disseminate and that we
are getting accurate information from everyone as well.

*High priority Projects:*
Help calling tenants who only are accessible via phone for updates and
concerns.
Printing hard copies of documents/emails/surveys for those who cannot
access them online.
Delivering hard copies of documents/emails/surveys for those who cannot
access them online.

*Spanish Translation:*
We desperately need help making sure the documents, surveys, emails, etc.
are able to be accessed by everyone in our building who speak another
language. We want to make sure everyone is able to read the information we
are trying to disseminate and that we are getting accurate information from
everyone as well.

*High priority for the association:*
Translation of documents/emails/surveys into Spanish.
Assistance with bi-lingual outreach to tenants.

*Minute taker:*
We need some help taking notes during meetings! If you are able to share
minutes notes via email after the meeting for us to than create our
bi-weekly email update that would be very helpful. Bonus if you can also
translate it into Spanish.

*Media:*
Creating fliers and how-to-guide's from the research materials we have
gathered.

*External Outreach:*
We need help with reaching out to legal aids, other tenant groups, local
resources, etc.

*High priority: *
Contacting Chhaya/Queens legal aid/other housing legal sources to get
resources for Covid-19 tenant protections.
Contact other Canvas owed building tenant associations.

*Rent History:*
We need help with collecting the rent histories of the apartments in the
building. This would also involve creating surveys and a spreadsheet for
collecting this information. Contacting housing dept for information on
document tampering is also high on the priority list.

Please let us know which, if any projects you can help with! We can't do
this work alone, so please* reach out to help us help you!*


Best,

Your Neighbors/Hayes Court United
