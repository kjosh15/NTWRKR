Good (if brief) convo with Joey, Shortlist's CEO, earlier today. He could
see a few clients IndigoMetrics might be a good fit as a whitelabeled
solution for Shortlist, Disney among them.

He also suggested that Trinet (whom they partner with) would be an ideal
partner for us - they have 16k clients and are the biggest contingency
workforce in the US. He's going to review all our materials and if he still
thinks so can intro us to their BizDev team.

Onward!
- J
