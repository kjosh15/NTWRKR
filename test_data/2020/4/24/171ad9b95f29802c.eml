Ah, that is wonderful news!!
The cosmos is working and I feel much better.
I will add you to my list and will reach out when in need.

Safe travels and wishing you a refreshing summer in beautiful Iceland.
I was only there once in the late 70=E2=80=99s on my way to Europe and =
hope to go back one day.

warm regards
david
