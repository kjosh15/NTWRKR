Subject: [You=E2=80=99re invited] VC discussion on how COVID-19 could chang=
e the
future of work -- Tues., April 28th at 12:30pm PST
To:


Please join a handful of venture investors who focus on the future of work
-- Kara Nortman (Upfront Ventures), Xuezhao Lan (Basis Set Ventures), Naomi
Ionita (Menlo Ventures), Jason Corsello (Acadian Ventures), and Roy Bahat
(Bloomberg Beta) -- as they discuss how COVID-19 could change work.

This might have been a private conversation among a few investors, trading
notes on our questions about the future of work. We decided we should make
it open to anyone in the broader tech community -- founders, people at
startups or established tech companies, policymakers, the curious, etc. --
interested in listening.

Unlike almost every other conversation among VCs, all the participants have
agreed to a =E2=80=9Cno predictions allowed=E2=80=9D rule -- instead of try=
ing to provide
false certainty, we=E2=80=99ll try to name the issues at stake as this cris=
is
shifts so much around us, including work.

Date: Tuesday, April 28, 2020

Time: 12:30pm PST

Strive, and Qordoba. Kara invests in SaaS, consumer and has a focus on
future of work. Before Upfront, Kara co-founded the children's e-commerce
company Moonfrye and also spent seven years at IAC where she co-headed the
M&A group and acted as the Senior Vice President and General Manager of

Stanley, Microsoft, and Battery Ventures. She received her AB in Politics

Dr. Xuezhao Lan (@xuezhao) is the founding partner of Basis Set Ventures, a
$140M early stage venture focused on improving work productivity through
artificial intelligence based out of San Francisco. Lan built the Corporate
Development Strategy team at Dropbox, one of the most active private tech
companies with more than 30 acquisitions. Prior to Dropbox, she worked with
McKinsey in New York and Shanghai, advising Fortune 500 companies on issues
such as big data/AI strategy, growth strategy, market entry, pricing, and
customer lifecycle management. Earlier in her career, Lan was an
entrepreneur who built children's brain training games and an analyst with
the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. She studied human brain
functions for her Ph.D. and received her MA in Statistics, both from the
University of Michigan. She also did her post-doc at Harvard and has
produced several peer-reviewed articles in top publications including
Science.


Naomi Ionita (@npilosof) joined Menlo Ventures as a partner in 2018,
bringing 13 years of operating experience and an expertise across product,
growth and monetization. Her investment focus is early-stage B2B SaaS
companies, and she spends a lot of time at the intersection of bottom-up
SaaS (product-led growth) and Enterprise SaaS. Naomi is especially fond of
habit-forming workflow products that create compounding value for both
users and the business over time. Current areas of interest include
productivity, future of work, departmental SaaS, AI and workflow automation=
.

Naomi began her tech career in 2006, after working in industrial
engineering and management consulting. She was most recently Vice President
of Growth at Invoice2go (a top grossing business app worldwide), where she
built teams across product, design, data, lifecycle marketing, and user
research. Prior to that, Naomi was a product lead at Evernote, where she
also founded the product-led growth team. Her expertise includes building
full-stack teams, launching self-serve product, and driving retention and
monetization. Naomi loves participating in the broader tech community as an
advisor, speaker, and guest lecturer at Reforge, Saastr, Traction, and
more. As someone who has built new products from scratch, and helped
existing products scale from 10M to 100M users, she empathizes with
entrepreneurs at every stage of the business and product lifecycle.

Naomi holds a bachelor of science in industrial engineering from
Northwestern University and an MBA from Stanford University=E2=80=99s Gradu=
ate
School of Business. She lives in San Francisco with her husband, who is a
founder, and daughter, who is also a builder (using Magna-Tiles), and takes
every opportunity she can to travel somewhere new.



Jason Corsello (@jcorsello) is the founder & General Partner of Acadian
Ventures. Acadian Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm
specializing in the Future of Work with investments in companies including

market as an industry analyst, management consultant, and operating
executive.  Most recently, Corsello was on the executive management
team at Cornerstone
OnDemand <http://www.csod.com/> [NASDAQ: CSOD] as Senior Vice President of
Strategy and Corporate Development. Corsello joined Cornerstone in 2011,
leading various functions over 7 years including global marketing, business
development, corporate development, and strategy.  In this role, Corsello
was responsible for driving innovation, go-to-market strategies and new
corporate initiatives including guiding M&A, leading the company's
corporate venture investments and accelerator program, and overseeing the
company=E2=80=99s content strategy and innovation lab.



Corsello joined Cornerstone from HR consulting firm Appirio (now a Wipro
Company), where he was senior vice president of strategy and corporate
development, responsible for the organization's strategy and solutions. At
Appirio he also developed and launched many new services at the firm and
played a lead consulting role with many of the firm's Global 2000 clients
including Nike, Dell, and Metlife.  Prior to his role with Appirio,
Corsello was a research director at Yankee Group (now S&P Global Market
Intelligence), leading the company's human capital management and talent
management advisory and consulting services. He also spent six years with
Flextronics International, where he worked with large, multinational
clients in developing their outsourced manufacturing and supply chain

industry expert in human capital management and has been featured in
leading publications including The Economist, The Wall Street Journal,  and

University of San Diego.



Roy Bahat (@roybahat <http://twitter.com/roybahat>) is the head of
Bloomberg Beta, an early-stage venture firm backed by Bloomberg that
invests in startups making work better, with a focus on machine
intelligence.

Unlike most corporate-backed venture capital funds, Bloomberg Beta invests
for financial return. Bloomberg Beta strives to model working in the same
new ways as startups -- transparent (with its once-internal operating manua=
l
<https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md>
open sourced), driven by data (with a program to statistically predict who
will start companies in the future), and highly dependent on trust (with
founder NPS as its main operating metric).

Before starting the firm, Roy co-founded a venture-backed company and led a
subsidiary of News Corporation, IGN Entertainment, where he created a
program to recruit software engineers without looking at their resumes,
replaced traditional performance reviews with a real-time feedback system,
and set annual bonuses by decision of all employees. He had also worked for
News Corporation's chairman.

In addition to founding startups and working as a corporate executive in
media, he has served in government (in the office of the New York City
Mayor), academia (as a lecturer at UC Berkeley=E2=80=99s Haas School of Bus=
iness),
professional services (early in his career at McKinsey & Co.), and
non-profit (currently on the advisory board of Stanford=E2=80=99s Center on
Philanthropy and Civil Society and as an advisor to the Center for
Investigative Reporting).

Roy was named one of Fast Company=E2=80=99s Most Creative People in Busines=
s and is
a commissioner on the California Governor's Future of Work Commission.

He graduated from Harvard College and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford
University studying economics.
