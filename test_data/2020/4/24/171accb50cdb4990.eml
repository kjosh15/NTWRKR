Hi Josh and Hulda,

I=E2=80=99ve been mulling over my summer plans and need to shift my =
trajectory. =20

The short story is that I gave up my Brooklyn apt after 28 years at the =
end of January for financial and spatial freedom. I was enticed by the =
beauty of your offer, but I just realized that it would lock me into nyc =
for the whole summer.  I decided I needed to have more fluidity to get =
out of the city, which doesn=E2=80=99t match your cat care needs. =20

My apologies for this late realization, I=E2=80=99ve just been swamped =
with work up here so my mind was dealing with the immediate tasks before =
me.  I hope you will find a replacement for your sweet home.  I=E2=80=99m =
sure there are folk would love a change of space for the summer.

Again, thank for this wonderful offer and I=E2=80=99m very sorry that I =
won=E2=80=99t be able to accept it.

all my best
david

Of course, given everything I think it would be wise for both of us to =
touch base at the end of this month to see what the world is like.  I =
