Adrian, meet Rachel - an incredible author and thinker with extensive
experience in the intelligence community.

Rachel, meet Adrian - another incredible thinker I recently reconnected
with. He's got an interesting fiction work and a ton of other experience I
think you'll find interesting.

I leave it to you two from here!

All best,
Josh
