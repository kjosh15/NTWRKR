We already have a couple going through a separation who are very grateful
and excited about taking the apartment, so it looks like this will work out
beautifully for them and us. We do love to travel and we'd love to keep you
in mind for the future if you're ever interested in exploring Jackson
Heights at some point. Our 15 years of experience of lending our apartment
has been overwhelmingly positive. Reach out anytime you might need housing
and who knows, we might jump on the opportunity to get out of town.

Wishing you all the best,
Hulda
