Wanted to mention I really appreciated your comments about culture on
today's call! I'm also super curious to hear more about how
Ethisphere might be able to use our platform to measure employee beliefs
and behavior. Do you have time in the next couple weeks to discuss further?

All best wishes,
Josh
