Hi neighbours,

Please join us for our first action if you are willing and able:
*Saturday and Sunday (April 25 & 26) - all day*
*All tenants report to 311: "We Have No Super!"*
Call 311, text 311-692, use the website
<https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02256>, or the app.

As we mentioned in our meeting on Tuesday, this weekend we would like
anyone who is willing and able to contact 311 to report that we have had no
super since March 1st. Attached is an info packet
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kMCrH9s0kWcbXbcrnuLxeYtgKhJep6UM> explaining
what we're doing, why we're doing it and how to go about it. It's important
that as many of us as possible do this in a short space of time.


Frequently Asked Questions:
*How do I report? What do I say? Why are we doing this?*
The attached info packet
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kMCrH9s0kWcbXbcrnuLxeYtgKhJep6UM> has
all the information. You can call 311, text 311-692, use the website
<https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02256>, or use the app.
*Can I report anonymously?*
You can report anonymously, but ONLY if you text or call. Do NOT use the
app or website if you wish to remain anonymous.
*What if management retaliates against me for calling?*
It is possible that management will retaliate if non-anonymous complaints
are made. If management contacts you to harass you in ANY way (including
but not limited to verbal harassment, lockouts, eviction or refusal to
renew lease), please record the interaction and let us know IMMEDIATELY -
we will move swiftly to report this harassment and ensure that your rights
are protected. *It is illegal for management to harass you.*
*Is this serious enough for 311?*
311 is the city's hotline for non-emergency issues regulated by city
departments. Our complaints will be sent to the Department of Housing
Preservation and Development, who may be able to fine management for
breaching housing code.

Any other information you might need should be included in the info packet.
If you have any questions or know someone who needs a paper copy of this
packet, please don't hesitate to email us.

Thanks
Milo, Bri and Jay.
