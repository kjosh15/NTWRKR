Joshua,
   Sorry for the delay (from your request yesterday). I inadvertently sent a=
 text to David (our rector) at the church office no. (a landline - no texts)=
 rather than his =E2=80=98cell. His response (once I got the message to him)=
 is not encouraging:

=E2=80=9CThe number I have . . . As a caveat, BBB is only doing PPP loans fo=
r existing clients. . .=E2=80=9D

  Do you want me to try to push on this or let it go?

Love,
DAD

Joel K Klein
