When you get a chance - it's one author's take on how NYC is likely to
change as a result of COVID-19. Really worth thinking about as we look to
the next 6 months or so!

Similarly, I did a call with a very smart analyst (Keith, formerly of DOW
Chemical) who believes sincerely that we're going to see food shortages
leading to riots. It's not clear if that is more or less likely here in the
USA, and/or how it may look in EU vs Iceland, but it's something to think
about for the next year or so.

Really, really appreciate you engaging me on all this! It's not fun, it's
pretty grim, but it ultimately helps us make better choices for our family.

xoxo,
Josh
