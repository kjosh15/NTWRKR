Michael,

In the spirit of radical transparency here's an initial swag at terms. In
the meantime, can you send us your list of values so we can get you set up
to use the platform internally? We're hopeful we can resolve the below and
get moving quickly. To that end, does it make sense to schedule a call next
week to work through any issues? If so let us know what times work best for
you.


# Right to buy stock:

- Conditions to exercise: Big Spaceship / IndigoMetrics JV has generated a
minimum of 50,000 users across a minimum of 5 companies. (This is what our
UK partner has agreed to deliver within the year in exchange for revenue
share and build of their own offering.)

- Exercise date: 1 year from now.

- Wording: option agreement to stop us diluting before and after purchase.

Notes:

The option would be in your personal name and we would welcome you to the
advisory board as a part of the purchase. We have a percentage in mind
based on our overall valuation price, but wanted to clarify that we see
this option as being protection for you. I.e., if we sell for a decent
price in 2 years' time and you want exclusive we could give you $1m profit
to replicate the platform if needed.

Does that fit your understanding, did you have a % in mind, and/or would it
help to look at our financial model?


Revenues:

- IndigoMetrics keeps revenue from sales of platform via Big Spaceship. We
agree to a matrix of pricing and free periods etc., but will be flexible to
grow the business.


Exclusivity:

- 1 year exclusivity within consultancy to US corporations, but this
requires a clear definition of =E2=80=9Cconsultancy.=E2=80=9D

Notes: Any ideas? It may be that =E2=80=9Cbrand management advisory consult=
ancy=E2=80=9D is
clearer, but probably better if you define this as you will know what you
want to cover better than us.

Onward!!
- J
