Was wondering if you had a little time next week to talk about contingency
planning. We may be able to retreat to Vermont, and can certainly flee to
Iceland, but don't want to do either unless absolutely necessary. Figuring
out what criteria to watch for as indicators has proven difficult as we're
juggling some emotional and logistical issues, and I could really use a
clear headed third party in figuring out what the plan should be. Any
chance you're available for a short call to discuss?

Many many thanks,
Josh
