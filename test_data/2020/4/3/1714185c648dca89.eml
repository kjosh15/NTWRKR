Hi Josh,

Thanks for taking a look.

We should be clear upfront, we don't have the budget or really the focus of
hiring a consultant to help us win business. Our mining consultant is
different in that he brings two decades of experience in mining from an
innovation perspective, something we would not be able to find anywhere
else, so he's helping us run the program and win new business to grow it.
If it were just the latter, he wouldn't be on a retainer with us for that.

My take was perhaps we can find something that we can win together,
amplifying each other's capabilities in the face of a client (BP?). You and
Newlab would have a role in a program developed and we bring a corporate
partner(s) to fund it. So we are taking advantage of each of our talents
and network. The program funding would include a scope for your role and we
can talk about how to view things long-term. There is no equity taken from
startups in our programs unless there is capital put into them. However,
new venture creation or "purpose built" startups for corporations could be
an interesting place to play for upside. We are working on a few programs
there with some entrepreneurs currently.

I wouldn't expect taking up too much of your time building up something and
pitching it, and always understand that you need to make a living, so all
good if the above wouldn't work. Apologies if I confused things on our last
call.

If this makes sense and feels good to you, happy to continue and I can
answer more of your questions below, send more info, etc.

Best
Satish
