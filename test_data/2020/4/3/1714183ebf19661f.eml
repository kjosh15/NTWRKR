We've got bad news. Because of COVID-19, all our income for the year so far
and in the near future has been wiped out, and we need to stop
participating in Blue Balloon. We're super upset about this as it's been a
part of both our boys' lives for years now and has been a foundation of the
arts for our whole family.

We're hoping that by June we'll have found our feet and be able to
re-enroll. Until then, please let Alex (and Megan) know that they had an
immense positive impact on our kids and we cannot thank them enough.

Sincerely,
Josh Klein, Othinn and Haakon's Dad
