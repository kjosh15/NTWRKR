Thanks, Satish! A few brief questions on the Verizon x Newlab 5G Studio
deck:

- Is the timeline in the 5G deck still accurate (open call April 15 - June
1)?

- How do you see managing Workshop / Convene functions given social
distancing? Just go directly virtual, or have you considered
build/buy/accessing governance platforms (might generate more data on the
process)?

- What startups do you already have in the pipeline for this, if any?

- Let me know when you have the telemedicine/health focus area updated; I'm
very keen on this section!

In our last call we discussed a retainer agreement to start with outreach.
Initial targets are big partners for enrollment, scoping, and running
through the process. This still makes sense to me, especially given current
moving market conditions.

Before moving forward, I'd like to know your growth plans for the lab and
how to get involved in steering this and future labs beyond securing first
customers. What milestones would indicate substantial enough success to
warrant revisiting the role? At what point does equity enter the
discussion? I ask knowing that this will change, but want to make sure
we're aligned about what future goals/targets might be!

There seems to be tons of opportunity to expand the program. For example,
the 5G infrastructure provides a significant hedge against learning
elsewhere. This is especially true across verticals and might be an awesome
model for other technologies (robotics, sensor networks, machine vision,
etc.). Moreover, I can think of many companies in a variety of verticals I
could approach today (BP, Bechtel, Sutter Health, LuluLemon, etc.).

What terms would work best for a retainer agreement, and which long-term
milestones would work best for us to use as reflection points? If we can
determine these, we could start moving on this quickly.

Excited to hear more and to pull out specific terms,
Josh

best,
Josh
