takeaways and action items *

*Special guests told members that the unprecedented crisis would lead to a
challenging and uncertain future. *=E2=80=9CRight now, everyone is presumin=
g that
the totality of this crisis is just figuring out the vaccine and reopening
the economies,=E2=80=9D Ian Bremmer said. =E2=80=9CPay attention to the kno=
ck-on
geopolitical implications that come from a dysfunctional, absent global
order. The politics=E2=80=94both domestically and internationally=E2=80=94c=
ould get really
much more conflictual in orientation as a consequence. Those are the places
where we=E2=80=99re going to see a lot more tail risk.=E2=80=9D Meanwhile, =
Larry Bossidy,
said: =E2=80=9CThis is as different a period as you will ever face in busin=
ess.=E2=80=9D A
few things to consider this week:

   - *Build a strong leadership foundation :: *Doug Conant emphasized the
   need for both a strong foundation and a masterful blueprint. Begin with:
      - A sense of purpose, =E2=80=9Cwhich the leader needs and the enterpr=
ise
      needs=E2=80=9D
      - A set of core leadership beliefs
      - A model for how they want to operate in the world
      - Practices to bring that model to life
      - A commitment to continuous improvement


   - *Execute an integrated stakeholder approach with clarity and
   =E2=80=9Cspirited=E2=80=9D connection :: *Conant advised that what organ=
izations
   communicate to customers, stakeholders, supply chain partners, investors
   and others must be coordinated and consistent. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s abo=
ut telling them how
   you=E2=80=99re going to navigate this, since the waters are too murky to=
 know what
   it=E2=80=99s going to look like when this is done.=E2=80=9D
   - *Celebrate what=E2=80=99s working publicly :: *Conant encouraged leade=
rs to
   celebrate what's being done right in their company as it relates to
   mission, values, and strategy. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve found that as I beg=
in to do that, I
   begin to have a growth and gratitude mindset that says, =E2=80=98You kno=
w, we're
   doing a lot of things right here,=E2=80=99 and the more I looked for thi=
ngs to
   celebrate, interestingly, the better we did.=E2=80=9D He also encouraged=
 leaders to
   have =E2=80=9Cradical flexibility=E2=80=9D with their teams at this time=
.
   - *Prepare for the domino effect of an uncoordinated global response and
   heightened geopolitical tensions :: *Ian Bremmer said we can expect to
   see an increase in Chinese soft power, democratic institutions increasin=
gly
   facing polarization and anti-establishment sentiment, a potential
   technology Cold War between the U.S. and China, and a stronger tilt towa=
rd
   Beijing among Southeast Asian nations as a result of this crisis and its
   geopolitical implications.
   - *A clarion call to leaders :: *Dambisa Moyo warned that while GDP
   predictions globally are portending a "deep and very long recession," it=
's
   worth remembering that governments and corporate leaders are showing the=
y
   can make hard decisions with very little information. She reminded membe=
rs
   to 1) focus firstly on the health of their workforce, both full-time and
   part-time, and suppliers; 2) ensure boards and corporations are providin=
g
   employees the support they need to work remotely while sheltering with
   their families; and 3) have a succession plan in place if the leader is
   unwell or incapacitated.
   - *Get ahead of things like furloughs, and be as sensitive as you can
   :: *Take some staff out as well=E2=80=94not just front-line employees, a=
dvised
   Larry Bossidy. =E2=80=9CGet your close team together and ask what the op=
portunities
   are so we can emerge stronger from this. Think innovatively and not in a
   way that=E2=80=99s insensitive, but in a way to make your business every=
 way
   stronger as it emerges from this.=E2=80=9D
   - *There will be some fallout from doing furloughs :: *Be candid with
   employees throughout the process and communicate. Bossidy suggested fram=
ing
   the messaging as: =E2=80=9CI know not everyone is happy with how we hand=
led things.
   We did it as carefully as we could to make sure that we could all get
   through. We=E2=80=99ve all taken pay cuts, but some were certainly impac=
ted more.
   Now it=E2=80=99s time to think about tomorrow. We=E2=80=99ve got a good =
business and need
   to get back on our feet. I hope you can recognize we did the best we
   could.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D
   - *Be careful of how you use modeling to determine the impact of
   COVID-19 on your business :: *Vivienne Ming started her conversation by
   being =E2=80=9Cbluntly honest=E2=80=9D that machine learning and artific=
ial intelligence
   are traditionally good at history: reviewing historical data and turning
   data into insights that often =E2=80=9Crival expert judgment,=E2=80=9D a=
nd doing so at a
   low cost and great speed. =E2=80=9CBut unfortunately, we're in a pretty =
novel
   situation here, so it=E2=80=99s hard for even the most sophisticated alg=
orithms
   dealing with this kind of data."
   - *Manage all sides of COVID-19 risk ::* =E2=80=9CWe are in a trolley pr=
oblem
   right now,=E2=80=9D said Ming. =E2=80=9CI am in no way pulling back on t=
he thread of the
   immediate health concern, but somehow we need to do a better job of
   managing the consequences of what we=E2=80=99re doing. We need to be mat=
ure enough
   to be able to appreciate that both sides of this could be devastating, a=
nd
   we need to find a better balance to policy strategies right now.=E2=80=
=9D
   - *Thinking about the human capital side of this moment :: *Ming=E2=80=
=99s
   advice to executives on investing in their employees during the COVID-19
   crisis: 1) Teach them a hard skill, such as programming; 2) Build
   resilience.


*Ian Bremmer broke down the various responses to the pandemic by region,
assessing the risks and providing an outlook for the future:*

   - *China: *=E2=80=9CThe first month of the Chinese response was obfuscat=
ion and
   suppression,=E2=80=9D said Bremmer. Once the Chinese government realized=
 they
   couldn=E2=80=99t contain the virus, they were able to enforce an effecti=
ve lockdown
   with =E2=80=9Cextraordinary authority=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cextraordinar=
y technological
   surveillance.=E2=80=9D China=E2=80=99s ability to identify cases, do ful=
l-contact tracing
   and implement social distancing has allowed it to restart the economy an=
d
   reopen Wuhan; Bremmer estimated the Chinese economy is back at 70% in te=
rms
   of its supply chain now, and that 100% will be operational by May 2020.
   - *South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan: *Experienced with handling
   SARS and MERs, these nations were earlier than most other countries in
   implementing social distancing and tracking cases. Despite that, in the
   past few days, Japan has declared a state of emergency, and Singapore ha=
s
   extended a shutdown.
   - *Europe and the U.S.: *While the U.S. and some European countries
   stopped travel from China early on, they have been late in other aspects=
:
   =E2=80=9CLate in surging health care capacity, late in identifying the s=
everity of
   the crisis, and uncoordinated at social distancing and eventual lockdown
   and quarantine measures.=E2=80=9D
   - *Emerging markets: *The outlook is bleak for emerging markets. =E2=80=
=9CThere
   is no scenario under which they=E2=80=99re going to have the economic re=
silience or
   the health care resilience to respond in a way that they need to.=E2=80=
=9D These
   countries will be hit the hardest, because they will have to rely on her=
d
   immunity and won=E2=80=99t be able to roll out effective testing.


*Quick Hits: Bite-sized recommendations from your peers and special guests*

   - *Doug Conant=E2=80=99s three Cs of virtual communication:*
      - *Competence*: =E2=80=9CShowcase you know what=E2=80=99s going on, a=
nd you know the
      kinds of things you need to do to deal with it.=E2=80=9D

aid you=E2=80=99d do.=E2=80=9D

   - Truepic.com, a photo and video verification platform recommended by
   Hany Farid, professor of Computer Science, Digital Forensics, University=
 of
   California at Berkeley
   - World 50 members shared some of the ways they=E2=80=99re building more
   flexibility into their teams=E2=80=99 schedules during this crisis:
      - Weekly video/written memos from CEO with candid thoughts on remote
      working, status of the organization, etc.
      - Blocking off the afternoon for teams to focus on training,
      learning, development
      - No meetings during lunch so families can eat together
      - Virtual happy hours dedicated only to catching up and connecting
      (no work discussions)
   - =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re thinking long term how work might be different.=
 We never
   thought we=E2=80=99d have jobs working off-site=E2=80=94now we have 97% =
off-site, which is
   opening up all kinds of possibilities. It=E2=80=99s a whole new world fo=
r us
   accessing talent. We thought we=E2=80=99d never get there, and then we g=
ot there in
   two weeks. This is all a massive tailwind. We=E2=80=99re very excited fr=
om that
   perspective.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 World 50 Member
   - =E2=80=9CMy team is predominantly female, and they have lots of kids i=
n the
   mix. This whole homeschooling thing is unprecedented. I try and be mindf=
ul
   of the fact that there are just times that they're not going to be
   available. =E2=80=A6 Be as flexible as you can from the beginning to kee=
p people
   from feeling so much pressure. Because we've drafted and disseminated 30=
0
   pieces of communications in the last month. We're not staffed for that.=
