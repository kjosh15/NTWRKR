DON'T GET ME FUCKING STARTED.

There are many issues with this plan, but we can start with slide 16.

"a lifetime encrypted channel".

i.e. keys never get compromised or lost (bear in mind that a "DID" is a
private key, in practice).

Right.

Also: who gives a fuck that I have chosen a private key? What interesting
property about me does that prove? Only, assuming no compromise, that I am
the same guy as last time.

Any other property has to be asserted by some authority. Which are
centralised.

What do I do if my key is compromised in their system? Their answer: start
again. Without a house or bank balance, coz those now belong to the other
guy, I guess?

BTW, I know Drummond from back when I worked on this stuff - and before,
actually. This is his nth attempt to get rich via identity. XDI was the
first I was aware of and I hated it from within about 10 minutes of hearing
about it (at Codecon - ah, such memories). XDI was long before I actually
worked on identity.
