Yoinks!  What an excellent exclamation.  I am all better.  Just hunkering
in.  Questioning my life choices...

I honestly don't know what I'm looking forward to.  As much as I enjoy
IDEO, I'm feeling a bit... limited.  Not sure how that is going to play out
yet, but being in a design consultancy means being on the edges.  Not sure
I want to be there.
