This is beautiful. Only change I would make would be to remove "We are
aware of" from "We are aware of similar transactions".

The section about "beyond the walled garden" should be pulled out as a
separate section of "Future Plans." This is the vision that drives the
whole thing!

And as for Hemingway, try reading the sentence out loud to one of your
children. As soon as you see their eyes start to roll back in their heads
you'll know you need to rewrite. Seriously, being able to radically
simplify this will force the true value to surface!!
