Extract from a conversation below with Theresa at Rivel on the subject of
SOC2. I'll get myself up to speed on what WISPs and TOMs are but sounds like
we make a similar argument to her to try and avoid it. Not sure she is
correct on the extent of the personal data that they have being equal to
ours - but I get her point that they must come quite close in some instances
where they have done an internal survey.

C 

 

We have a lot of personal data - names, titles, emails, phone numbers,
companies, etc. of the people we interview, and for clients we additionally
have encrypted passwords and website usage information. For all, we also
have survey responses and sometimes temporary audio files. So it's quite
similar to the data you have, except that you also have birthdays and
gender, but none of that is 'sensitive information'. Article 32 of GDPR only
states that the data are protected in an 'appropriate' manner given the
sensitivity of the data (see text below and link). For example, if you
aren't processing credit card data, you don't need to have PCI compliance.
And the cost of the tech implementation needs to be considered as well.  I
usually tell clients that as a small company we don't claim ISO compliance
or have SOC audits performed, that we don't process any sensitive personal
data or credit card info, and that we have a full WISP and TOMs suitable to
protect the data we do process. We'll verify compliance with any law that
applies, but the law never requires that we have a SOC 2 audit performed -
and for us it would be overkill in terms of data sensitivity and cost. It's
usually a negotiation. Some contracts will just say that IF we have an audit
performed, we will give them the results, but since we don't get one done, I
never provide it.

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and
the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of
varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk
