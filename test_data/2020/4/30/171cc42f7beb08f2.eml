Definitely, and thanks for the intro! I've attached our overview deck, and
more info is available at www.indigometrics.com. The platform allows you to
measure and manage the behavior and beliefs of your employees, but does so
using peer-to-peer data to create a feedback loop to create alignment
ongoing. It's different from most of the tools out there in that it gives
both managers and employees really good feedback throughout the process, so
there's significant support at every level as companies grow and change.

Happy to set up a time to discuss further!

All best,
Josh
