This is amazing; thanks so much for the thoughtful response!! Curious to
see what this will lead to, especially in terms of pricing - it seems as
though the scale of the factory farms made artificially sublimated pricing
possible for a long time and that tab is now coming due.

To that end I'm in a number of meetings weekly with big business owners who
are hypothesizing that we'll see an increase in "private club" access
groups by region. I.e., if you can pay a premium for locally produced meat,
you'll get a slot in a service that will act as a bulwark against public
purchasing. Do you think that's likely?

And of course, I recognize this isn't what you're paid for, so feel free to
just punt this email - this is all just because I'm curious!!

All best and see you Sunday. Stay healthy!
- Josh
