Chris,

Talked to my friend at revupfund.com and she gave me a very sharp talking
to. Essentially, we need to get really clear on a) what we're growing
towards (acquisition, partnership, investment, etc.), and b) get much more
revenue to prove we're worth that path. My notes are below, but suggest we
carve out some time for the thought exercise Monday, esp. given how weird
COVID-19 has made things.

All best,
Josh


|    plenty of liquidity in our market
|    hit $1mm in revenue - first milestone
|    maybe looking for strategic partner to buy majority of company so we
can still operate it
|    growth for its own sake not as popular now - because it mostly just
failed
|    revenue requirements really gone up
|    value of our p;atform is interface and design - not data
|    VCs looking for 1-5mm in revenue for series A checks
|    need case studies for investors
|    need to define growth in a cogent way
|    how fast can you get to 1mm and then to 5?
|    how differentiated and how to express this
