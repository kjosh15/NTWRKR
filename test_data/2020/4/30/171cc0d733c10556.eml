Glad to hear it! I was thinking of revisiting the idea with some target
companies, based mostly on this piece
<https://qz.com/work/1831644/your-company-should-start-a-podcast-during-the=
-covid-19-crisis/?utm_source=3Demail&utm_medium=3Dquartz-at-work>.
If you could pick any project to work on with any vertical or specific
company out there, what would it be? I'm still keen to do more of this, and
was really impressed by you and your work when we spoke last year. Let me
know what interests you; it may be there's a connection I can help make!

All best,
Josh
