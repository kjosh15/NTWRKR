Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple!

I'm sorry you are running into this issue with Elementor.  I see that you have put a lot of effort into fixing the issue and wish we could provide you with direction.  

As you surely know, every site is unique. Given the quantity and ever-changing complexity of internet software, it simply isn't feasible for us to know the details of how the applications you're running work or interact.  We are happy to help you set up everything regarding our servers and will often go the extra mile to help you find solutions. In this case, it is impossible to know the best next direction aside from starting from scratch using the existing site as a resource.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can answer for you regarding the information in this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services. Feel free to reply to this support request or call us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you.

Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Phoebe A.
