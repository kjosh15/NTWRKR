Replies below:

- The CORS policy.

It seems to only be an error in calling a placeholder image (appears when I
reload the editing page where the save error appears):

(Access to image at 'http://placehold.it/1920x1080' from origin '
http://www.h4xindustries.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.)

If this is a policy issue, why wasn't this a problem before? I was editing
away happily until yesterday afternoon when the problem suddenly appeared.
Secondary to this, I don't think it's likely that my hosting provider is
going to change their CORS policy; is this ignorable?

- Switch your theme (temporarily) to a default WP theme such as Twenty
Sixteen and see if it makes any difference.

Tried this; it didn't change the behavior.

- If the above didn't help, please also send us your system info file
(Elementor > System Info) so we can check your current WordPress
environment. There's a 'Download' button at the bottom.

Please find attached.

- 500 errors are server issues and can occur for many reasons. And we will
need the PHP error logs of your server to determine the cause of the
problem.

I have them; let me know what timespan you need to see and if you need me
to run through any actions on the site/tools to see what they generate
before sending them over.

While you're here, I'm also having a problem where a youtube video is
embedded at the bottom of the landing page. I cannot find where the video
is inserted, and have deleted all the blocks and it still appears. Any tips
on hunting it down to remove it?

Thanks so much!
Josh

<br>
<br>So far I&#39;ve debugged as per <a href=3D"https://docs.elementor.com/a=
rticle/185-the-update-button-does-not-work" target=3D"_blank">https://docs.=
elementor.com/article/185-the-update-button-does-not-work</a>:
<br>
<br>- Erase some sections in the page that you are trying to save and see i=
f it enables you to perform the action (you can retrieve them by using the =
revision history of Elementor).=20
<br>
<br>I erased all the sections of the page; the problem persisted.
<br>
<br>
<br>- Increase the WP memory limit. You can fit the memory limit to our req=
uirements and activate the debug mode of WordPress to check how many MB you=
 need exactly. Although you can do it by yourself, it is preferable to cont=
act your hosting provider for further assistance.=20
<br>
<br>Current memory limit is 256, the max recommended by Elementor docs.
<br>
<br>
<br>- Sometimes, saving issues can happen when the admin-ajax.php script ti=
meouts. You can know if it is the issue by checking the error messages appe=
aring in your browser console. The error message, in this case, is Failed t=
o load resource: the server responded with a status of 413. When you experi=
ence this problem, add the following directives to your .htaccess file to i=
ncrease the dynamic timeout:=20
<br>&lt;IfModule mod_dtimeout.c&gt; &lt;Files ~ &quot;.php&quot;&gt; SetEnv=
If Request_URI &quot;admin-ajax.php&quot; DynamicTimeout=3D150 &lt;/Files&g=
t; &lt;/IfModule&gt;
<br>
<br>Watching the console, I found the error was:=20
<br>
<br>VM5878:1 POST <a href=3D"http://www.mysite.com/MANI/wp-admin/admin-ajax=
.php" target=3D"_blank">http://www.mysite.com/MANI/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php<=
/a> 500 (Internal Server Error)
<br>
<br>I added the line requested to .htaccess in the root of my wordpress dir=
ectory. No luck.
<br>
<br>I did not divide my work into a few templates and paste them into anoth=
er page, nor added an SSL certification as neither are an option at this ti=
me. What else should I try?
