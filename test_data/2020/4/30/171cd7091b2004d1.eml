Hi Josh,

That is a very good article reiterating the importance of internal
communication. I think some places are definitely doing this, or wanting to
do it yet don't know the how-tos. And if they are doing it, they're not
doing the proper distributing and internal outreach to engage employees to
find and listen.

Understanding most companies prefer to keep budget next to nill and to work
internally, I thoroughly enjoy talking with people in the beginning stages
of concept and development, overview, brainstorming, then creating a
production workflow, technical recommendations and setup, best practices
and protocols for creating such internal podcasts.

Keep on, keeping on and do reach out if you start development of your own
or hear of such questions circling your network.

All the best,
Lisa
