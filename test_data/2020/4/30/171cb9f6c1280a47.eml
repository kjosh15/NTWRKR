launch an AI initiative in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. As the =
first step of this initiative (we have a number of other directions we =
are pursuing in leveraging AI towards this cause), we have developed =
COVID-Net - an open source deep neural network for detecting COVID-19 =
infections from chest radiography, with AI explanations to gain =
transparency into visual indicators of COVID-19.  With the unprecedented =
number of COVID-19 infections on a global scale, chest radiography =
(e.g., chest X-rays) has now become more than a complementary screening =
tool to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR testing (i.e., the swab lab =
test), with it actually being used as a primary screening tool in the =
countries that are most affected due to its speed and availability.
>>>> =20
>>>> Rapid screening is critical as it enables those infected to receive =
immediate care, as well as be isolated to mitigate the spread of the =
virus.  By leveraging deep learning AI with COVID-Net, we aim to help =
clinicians improve both sensitivity and specificity by better =
differentiate COVID-19 infections from other forms of viral infections, =
which is a current challenge faced given their similarities, as well as =
assist clinicians with additional knowledge about how COVID-Net detects =
COVID-19 infections through AI explanations. We are making COVID-Net =
available in an open source, open access manner, the hope is to =
accelerate the global use and development of complementary COVID-19 =
screening solutions for rapid screening of those who need it most.
>>>>=20
>>>> The COVID-Net model, dataset, and scientific paper describing both =
COVID-Net and dataset (5941 posteroanterior chest radiography images =
across 2839 patient cases gathered from public datasets) are available =

diagnosis using COVID-Net - which would help with adoption in the field.

research teams at the University of Waterloo and DarwinAI have launch an =
AI initiative in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. As the first step =
of this initiative (we have a number of other directions we are pursuing =
in leveraging AI towards this cause), we have developed COVID-Net - an =
open source deep neural network for detecting COVID-19 infections from =
chest radiography, with AI explanations to gain transparency into visual =
indicators of COVID-19.&nbsp; With the unprecedented number of COVID-19 =
infections on a global scale, chest radiography (e.g., chest X-rays) has =
now become more than a complementary screening tool to polymerase chain =
reaction (PCR) PCR testing (i.e., the swab lab test), with it actually =
being used as a primary screening tool in the countries that are most =
affected due to its speed and availability.</div><div =

screening is critical as it enables those infected to receive immediate =
care, as well as be isolated to mitigate the spread of the virus.&nbsp; =
By leveraging deep learning AI with COVID-Net, we aim to help clinicians =
improve both sensitivity and specificity by better differentiate =
COVID-19 infections from other forms of viral infections, which is a =
current challenge faced given their similarities, as well as assist =
clinicians with additional knowledge about how COVID-Net detects =
COVID-19 infections through AI explanations. We are making COVID-Net =
available in an open source, open access manner, the hope is to =
accelerate the global use and development of complementary COVID-19 =
screening solutions for rapid screening of those who need it =
most.</div><div =
