Just keeping on top of these. Obviously times in the energy sector continue
to be "dynamic"!

1. Let me know when/if you'd be available to talk about the culture
metricing platform I described.

2. New Lab has been in touch with "Miriam" at Launchpad, and are setting up
a call. Let me know if/how I can help facilitate here.

3. Curious to know more about the board of advisors opp you described
(although obviously not time sensitive atm). Keep me posted.

All best,
Josh
