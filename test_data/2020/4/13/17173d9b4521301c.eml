So glad to hear it - that's what community is for!! I'm trying to push them
to get into online order + grocery delivery, so hopefully Dad'll find
someplace that delivers. Otherwise Walmart has been pioneering pickups of
orders (where you buy online, and then just pickup a box, thus reducing
exposure). All good options, and stuff that's going to grow like crazy as
this pandemic continues...!

Give all my best to Mark, and thanks for the update!
