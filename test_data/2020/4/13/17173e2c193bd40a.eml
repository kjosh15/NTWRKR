I've cc'd my wife so she can add to this, but in the meantime:

- Happy to print and pass fliers to the tenants I know are (or were until
recently) here: B41, B32, B22, and B01. I believe B21 and/or B32 just moved
out.

- The last time they organized a tenant's union tech was a big problem; a
lot of the tenants don't have email, let alone slack. The demo has shifted,
but I'd suggest email as a more neutral platform accessible to all.

- My biggest concern is the total lack of good faith. Since the new owners
arrived we've been promised everything from routine repairs to a roof deck,
none of which have actually manifested. Additionally, many of the
apartments were rent stabilized or had rent stabilization in their history,
and since the new owners took over they've filed "corrections" which (in
some cases falsely) change the record to indicate rent stabilization had
been dismantled. This is after the threatening calls, illegal evictions,
etc. they used to try to drive tenants out so they could raise rents.

Given the coronavirus it seems like a good time to get the owners to the
table to deliver on:

a) Basic repairs and services (like worker boilers and leaking roofs)
b) an in-building super with regular trash pickup, repairs, and grounds
cleanup,
c) re-establishment of rent stabilization in apartments that had them
d) clear, legally binding rent deferment or payback plans as we go through
the pandemic.

Let us know what else we can do to help - now is definitely the time!!

All best,
Josh
