Doing well; the kids are having a blast generally, although they miss their
friends. School has been cancelled through the summer, so now we're just
regrouping and trying to figure out a game plan for the near term.

The only big concerns are around food supplies; so far we're doing great,
and the food platforms we usually order our food from are coming through
great (except for obvious stuff like toilet paper, hand sanitizer, masks,
etc.) but if food starts to become harder to get things could get dangerous
quickly.

Overall the numbers continue to be encouraging, inasmuch that the more we
learn the less deadly the disease seems to be. But the political
mismanagement isn't stopping, and so we now turn to the economic
impacts. I'm unemployed since mid-December, so that's a bit scary. OTOH, I
have as strong brand as someone who can anticipate the future of tech, so
at some point I'm going to be in high demand again.

Iceland seems to have done a tremendous job with containment - the problem
being that tourism just fell off a cliff. What's the feeling over there
around where the economy is going and how you'll adapt, and what's your
personal strategy given that being on a boat seems really unsafe these days=
?
