For the past few years we've been developing an advanced analytics platform
for modeling employee engagement and alignment around core values. It
allows employees to answer five questions about five of their peers in
under three minutes, and then gives them anonymous feedback about how they
are perceived on the key behaviors their teams need.

What we've seen since the pandemic began is that users of our platform are
relying on it incredibly heavily to get insight into where they stand with
their teams, their direct reports, and their organizations. Because nobody
has the same face-to-face connections they used to, they are turning to
digital models to help them understand how to collaborate and navigate
business relationships.

If Bankinter is interested, we would be happy to make it available through
you to a prespecified number of members. Let us know if you think there'd
be interest and we'll send you more material on the platform and how it
works!

All best wishes,
Josh
