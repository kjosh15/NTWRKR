Sorry for the erratic series of replies; it's an interesting time!

Right now we're "paused," which is a hopeful euphemism for
shelter-in-place. We can go outside for exercise, but only one person is
supposed to go to any grocery stores at a time, which usually have lines to
keep the number of people inside limited.

We paired with another family early on, so life has been much more sane as
we have another set of adults and kids to connect with daily, keep us to a
schedule, go on walks with, etc. etc.

We decided not to go to Iceland early on in the pandemic because of their
lack of supplies; our bet was that NYC would do better at getting
early-stage supplies, testing, etc. and so far that has held to be true. We
are hopeful that we'll be able to go to Iceland this summer for our annual
vacation, but as with so much we'll have to wait and see what is possible!
But yes, they've done the most testing per capita of any country anywhere
and have had 6 deaths total so far, with a complete leveling of infection
rates.

My folks are doing great; they have a lovely cottage way out in the woods
about an hour from a small town called Walla Walla, so aside from Dad's
propensity to talk the ear off anyone he meets they seem quite happy. I'm
pushing them to find a good grocery delivery service so they can reduce
their exposure further.

Hope you all are doing well; how are you responding to the quarantine, and
are you learning any new skills or behaviors that seem to be helping?

Lots of love,
Josh
