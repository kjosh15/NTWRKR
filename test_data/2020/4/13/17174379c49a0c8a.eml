Well that all sounds pretty good - fingers crossed!  We are doing fine
here. We have kind friends getting groceries, or the shops will deliver if
you wait long enough. THe order we put in this morning will come on the
23rd, a week next THursday! The sun is shining and we have spent a lot of
time in the garden. My friend who lives across the road, and the one next
door and I, have been able to meet for coffee each sitting at  our gates
and with our own coffee, obviously. We have had a chat in the sunshine for
about an hour. It is easy to hear at that distance, though well over the 3
metres recommended. Walking up and down the drive I meet and chat with
neighbours ding their gardens - again at a suitable distance.  Have you
heard how Devon and Yvonne are getting on with all this, by the way?
 Much love t you all
Lyn and Robin
