Looks like NYC was able to get enough support in that we're not overloaded
on beds and ICUs, so far. It'll be very interesting to observe how the US,
with its disarticulated response, evolves to opening up its lockdown in the
weeks to come.

Hope you and yours are doing well - I'm still curious why you chose to stay
in the UK vs. heading back to Iceland, as that's a choice we made
ourselves.

All best,
Josh
