Two things:

1. To do this we may have some bounces in email - some may/may not go
through while we're doing the transition. Better to do this now, but didn't
want to start it without a heads up. I'll notify you before I hit go, but
let me know if there's any timing to pay attention to.

2. to set this up, I need the names and passwords of all the existing email
accounts and access to our controls on GoDaddy.com. Can you pass me the
credentials you've been using?
