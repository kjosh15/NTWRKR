Two options;

a) We all share our working calendars w/ availability only visible. That
means your gmail cal will show blocks for everyone's stuff.
b) Have one "kid's logistics" calendar, which has time blocked for kid care
each day, and we then share that.

The latter has the overhead of choosing who takes which blocks of time -
and we can all see the gaps. But it is one singular list we all need to
keep filled. The former shows where people are NOT available, in advance.

Which do you think would work best?
