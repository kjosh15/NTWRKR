Looking forward to the presidential elections we're estimating a 50/50
chance we're due to leave for the EU in 2021. Berlin is top of our list so
far. Do you have time for a brief call to talk about building networks in
the EU, what the business climate is like in Berlin, and overall tips for
transitions?

Hope you're well and your hobby projects are thriving!!
- J
