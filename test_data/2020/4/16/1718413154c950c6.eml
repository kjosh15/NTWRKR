Every thought leader and their brother is looking for a platform to talk
about the future of technology and how it's changing business in the time
of the pandemic. Do you have any tips on standing out and finding channels?

Hope you guys are doing well, all things considered - I miss seeing you
around the neighborhood or at '77!!

All best,
Josh
