 you might like this little poem for our times

The earth whispered but you did not hear.
> The earth spoke but you did not listen
> The earth screamed but you turned her off.
> And so I was born...
> I was not born to punish you..
> I was born to awaken you..
> The earth cried out for help...
> Massive flooding. But you didn't listen.
> Burning fires. But you didn't listen.
> Strong hurricanes. But you didn't listen.
> Terrifying Tornadoes. But you didn't listen.
> You still don't listen to the earth when.
> Ocean animals are dying due to pollutants in the waters.
> Glaciers melting at an alarming rate.
> Severe drought.
> You didn't listen to how much negativity the earth is receiving.
> Non-stop wars.
> Non-stop greed.
> You just kept going on with your life..
> No matter how much hate there was..
> No matter how many killings daily..
> It was more important to get that latest iPhone than worry about what the
> earth was trying to tell you..
> But now I am here.
> And I've made the world stop in its tracks.
> I've made YOU finally listen.
> I've made you take refuge.
> I've made you stop thinking about materialistic things..
> Now you are like the earth...
> You are only worried about YOUR survival.
> How does that feel?
> I give you fever.. as the fires burn on earth.
> I give you respiratory issues.. as pollution filled  the earth=E2=80=99s =
air.
> I give you weakness as the earth weakens every day.
> I took away your comforts..
> Your outings.
> The things you would use to forget about the planet and its pain.
> And I made the world stop...
> And now...
> China has better air quality.. Skys are clear blue because factories are
> not spewing pollution unto the earth's air.
> The water in Venice is clean and Because the gondola boats that pollute
> the water are not being used.
> YOU are having to take time to reflect on what is important in your life.
> Again I am not here to punish you.. I am here to Awaken you...
> When all this is over and I am gone... Please remember these moments..
> Listen to the earth.
> Listen to your soul.
> Stop Polluting the earth.
> Stop Fighting amongst each other.
> Stop caring about materialistic things.
> And start loving your neighbors.
> Start caring about the earth and all its creatures.
> Start believing in a Creator.
> Because next time I may come back even stronger....
> Signed,
> Coronavirus..
