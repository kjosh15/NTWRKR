That's great, thanks so much! I'll sit tight until I hear from her.

Everything here is going well, with some hope in sight. Being "first" is an
advantage in this case, and they're already talking about widespread
antibody testing.

Right now we're discussing heading to Iceland in late May/June, but it may
be just Hulda and the boys at first depending on what projects are in play.
Awkwardly there is a ton of interest in working on new/emerging tech
projects "in a few months." As ever with this pandemic, the future is
uncertain!!

How are you guys holding up; are you getting tired of being at home yet?
