This is an op-ed piece arguing that there is a huge opportunity in using
tracking technology in a new way with newly autonomous employees.

What's counterintuitive about this is that the technical support needed is
in empowering employees even further, and specifically in empowering them
to communicate between each other - not up or down the management hierarchy=
.

Businesspeople need to know this now because we're in a very narrow window
of unprecedented technology adoption, and first movers will see significant
advantage long-term, and especially as we come out of COVID-19 disruption.

This work builds on my last two books - Reputation Economics (McMillan) and
Hacking Work (Penguin) - as well as my consulting work to Fortune-400
executives from BP to Ford to Merck. Additionally, I co-founded
IndigoMetrics, a company focused on statistically modeling employee
behavior engagement and alignment, and have been working in this space for
the last four years. Finally, examples of past articles, interviews, etc.
are available at www.josh.is/writing

I've already written the article and am happy to offer it to you
exclusively if you think it would be a good fit. Please let me know if
you'd like to see it!

Many thanks,
Josh Klein
