OMG SO ADORABLE!!!! So amazing; huge huge congratulations!

I can only imagine what your schedule is like these days; give me a window
when you think she's likely to be sleeping and we can play phone tag next
week if needed.

Yep, we're in queens - ten minutes' walk from Elmherst Hospital, in fact.
Super exciting.

Looking forward to catching up,
Josh
