Brian,

Let me know if you have a half hour in the next couple weeks to talk about
how I might be able to help in describing the Incline opportunity to your
clients; I've been doing some thought leadership work in my own network and
am starting to see leaders looking to where they can proactively move ahead
of the competition as we come out of the pandemic.

If you think there's an opportunity there, let's compare notes and see if I
can be helpful  in your sales activities!

All best,
Josh
