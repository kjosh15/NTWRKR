Hi Josh,

Just a thought. This is the new rector of Bifr=C3=B6st:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/margr%C3%A9t-j%C3%B3nsd%C3%B3ttir-njar%C3%B0v%C=
3%ADk-12b59213/

I haven't met her or spoken to her yet. Check whether Hulda has any
connections to her. I think it might be interesting for you to speak to her
directly about what you do as she is now the head of Bifr=C3=B6st but also =
has
all sorts of connections.

xahh
