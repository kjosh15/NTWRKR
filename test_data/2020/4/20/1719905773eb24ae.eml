Just checking in; my family is ten blocks from the heart of the pandemic in
the US so these are definitely interesting times. So, first of all I hope
you and yours are safe and healthy!

Second thing is that the startup I've been working on for the last couple
years (IndigoMetrics.com) is about to ink a deal with a Fortune 200 and has
three more big (100k+ users) customers currently in the pipeline. The
coronavirus has officially shifted us from "very interesting and nice to
have" to "I need this to keep my company from capsizing." We're not moving
fast enough yet to knock on your door officially, but I think we're getting
close.

Would you game for a brief call to catch up on the last decade, help me
figure out when and how best to bother you in an official capacity, and
trade notes on life in the pandemic?

Sending all best wishes,
Josh
