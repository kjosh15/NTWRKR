Just checking in; my family is ten blocks from the heart of the pandemic in
the US so these are definitely interesting times. That said, while what's
happening is absolutely tragic, it is also a massive change - and change
can mean opportunity.

I've been doing a lot of work around measuring culture and behavior
(statistically and at scale) in ways leadership can use, and with the
sudden push to remote working we're seeing a huge uptick in companies
wanting more insight into what their newly-autonomous employees believe and
how they act. While I can't answer all of these questions it does seem like
the kind of thing AT Kearnery could do extremely well.

Let me know if you're up for a short call to catch up!

Sending all best wishes,
Josh
