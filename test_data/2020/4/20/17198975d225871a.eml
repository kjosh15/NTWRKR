Chris,

Sorry this took so long to get to. Your CV and related materials are
brilliant; extremely well done!! I honestly can't think of anything to add
here. In terms of contacts, below are the best I can offer - I don't have
any contacts at a number of these companies. Let me know if any are useful.

Finally, I'll be speaking to Rob Barnett in an hour - thanks again for
setting this up!

All best,
Josh
