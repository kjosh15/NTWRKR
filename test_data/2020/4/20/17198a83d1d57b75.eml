Wanted to update you that she connected with me on LinkedIn but made it
clear she was fighting fires atm but that we should reconnect in August.
So, one small step...

I may ping her again in a few weeks to see how she's thinking about making
Bifr=C3=B6st a leader or jumping off point for Icelanders looking to secure=
 work
outside of Iceland. With remote work the "brain drain" phenomena might end
up being a boon...

 Yes, NYC is scary at the moment, and we live ten minute&#39;s walk from El=
mhurst Hospital, the epicenter of the disease in the USA. Fortunately, we&#=
39;ve created=C2=A0a cell with another family and the kids are loving the h=
ome schooling that&#39;s been set up; they&#39;re flourishing with all the =
parental attention. The adults are time-sharing each other&#39;s apartments=
, which creates enough distance to keep us from going too crazy. The hardes=
