Been seeing a TON of amazing content out of W50; you guys are moving at a
million miles an hour. If you've got a moment and want to get outside your
current operating space I'd love to catch up with you. Otherwise, sending
all best wishes to you and yours - I hope you're all safe and healthy!!

All best,
Josh
