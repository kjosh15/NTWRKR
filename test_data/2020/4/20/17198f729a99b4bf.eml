Just checking in with my favorite folks; we're ten blocks from the heart of
the pandemic in the US so interesting times. Hit me with an update when you
get a chance; what's happening is absolutely tragic, but is also a massive
change - and change can mean opportunity.

Sending all best wishes,
Josh
