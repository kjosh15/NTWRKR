Ben,

Lately I've been trolling through my own contacts at LinkedIn (mostly to
help friends who are trying to figure out where to go after the bottom fell
out of their industry), and realized I somehow know:

Vikram Tank, Product Manager at Google focusing on AI
Davang Shah, Managing Director, Marketing at Google
Elizabeth Churchill, Director of UX at Google

Most of these I met after giving a presentation to some group or other, so
none are likely to remember my name off the top of their head. Do you think
it's worth pinging them to try to goose Google Recruiting?

As ever, feel free to tell me to fuck off on this approach - just looking
for new angles in an otherwise rather quiescent hiring cycle...

All best,
Josh
