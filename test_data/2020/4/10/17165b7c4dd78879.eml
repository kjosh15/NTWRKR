What time are we leaning toward? 2:00?, 2:30? We, the parental unit will wor=
k around your schedules. In regard to additional people, we leave it up to y=
ou. Mom-a-roo mentioned that my sister is also someone we should consider if=
 we are going to add individuals. It starts to get hard to imagine us not tr=
ying to talk over each other if we get a large group. We are back to we leav=
e it to you-all to decide.
