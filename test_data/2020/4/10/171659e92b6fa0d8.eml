Hey Josh,

My husband spent a week quarantined in the basement and then another week
in the house but not feeling 100%.  He is back at work and back to himself,
thank god!!

My only issue now is that my sitters (mom, sister and mother in law) are
either sick or practicing social distancing, so it's just me and the 3
kids.  I get to work for a couple of hours when they nap, if I'm lucky!!!

I can't wait for things to get back to normal and I can get back to work!
Momma needs a mental and physical break!!

I hope all is well with you guys!!

Steph
