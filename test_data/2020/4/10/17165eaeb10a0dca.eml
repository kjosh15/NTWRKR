Been chatting with GetDivvy, who are processing these claims faster than
anyone else. They suggested putting in an estimate for the 2019 taxes and
then submitting my 2018 return as evidence. Chances are I'll be contacted
for clarification.

It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. I know you're juggling
three kids, a sick husband, and isolation, but is there any chance you
could help me get an estimate on the 2019 State & Local Taxes On Employee
Compensation? Or should I just divide what I paid myself ($86,147.43 - we
lived out of our savings for a bit this summer) by 3 and call it good?

Many many many thanks,
- J
