I'm filing for payroll protection for myself; apparently you can file as a
sole proprieter, but the worksheet requires an entry for taxes on
compensation. The form is clearly for bigger businesses with multiple
employees - I don't pay Group health insurance, or Family Leave, for
example - but when I pulled out how much money I'd paid myself last year it
was too low to register any pay qualifying loan amount. Adding in a bogus
tax on compensation changed that. Can we make an estimate on 2019 taxes?

Really appreciate the help on this - the PPP money is vanishing super fast
so I'm a litte desperate to get my forms in...!

- J
