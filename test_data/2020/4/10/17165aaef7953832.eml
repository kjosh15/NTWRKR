Thank goodness!! Really glad to hear everyone is (relatively) healthy.
We're five blocks from Elmherst hospital in Queens, and it's pretty scary.

Otherwise things are great, although I'm trying to apply for the Payroll
Protection Plan and they're requesting the total of our 2019
State & Local Taxes On Employee Compensation. Given that we haven't filed
yet do you have any idea what this number should be?

Best of luck with the three kids... the good news is, at some point we'll
be able to look back and nod our heads sagely and how wonderful it was to
have all this time with them!

All best,
Josh
