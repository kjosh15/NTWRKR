Let's do 2:30pm PST. I think more than three "groups" gets a little
difficult. Let's stick with this list and we can expand if we like. I'm
happy to send out a zoom invite if everyone is ok with that, or we can try
Skype (although it's a lot buggier) - let me know what you're all
comfortable with!

xoxo,
Josh
