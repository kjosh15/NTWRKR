Hey - so sorry for the delay and I need to loop back and send an email to
Keith for you.  My mother-in-law had an accident last week so we had an
emergency relocation to Gaithersburg  Heading back to Va tomorrow.  Nope re
NYC this month (or next).   We are not at full force right now and only
doing "mission critical" work.  Long story.
