Glad to hear you're feeling better. Will be curious to hear where you net
out when you get to having an antibodies test...!

We're five blocks from Elmherst Hospital, the epicenter of the epicenter in
the USA. It's SUPER interesting; like sitting ringside on rapid global
change.

Plans for Summer are to head to Iceland if we're able. I'm trying to add on
some new contracts so I can do that remotely - and also push this
INCREDIBLE opportunity for Indigo along the way!
