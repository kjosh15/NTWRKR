Good to hear. Yes it's interesting times everywhere. There is a broadcast
from the Icelandic government happening now in 5 min. that I think will be
interesting.

We are all well. We have decided to stay in the UK as we have the girls and
the grandkids here but very much hoping to go to Iceland from July to
September if things are getting better.

I haven't forgotten about the Bifrost connection. There is a new rector and
I don't know here yet. I will send you her details later today and discuss
with you whether it might be best if you write to her directly.

Until later.

xahh

 Yes, NYC is scary at the moment, and we live ten minute&#39;s walk from El=
mhurst Hospital, the epicenter of the disease in the USA. Fortunately, we&#=
39;ve created=C2=A0a cell with another family and the kids are loving the h=
ome schooling that&#39;s been set up; they&#39;re flourishing with all the =
parental attention. The adults are time-sharing each other&#39;s apartments=
, which creates enough distance to keep us from going too crazy. The hardes=

national talks reflect this focus, as does his work consulting and advising=
 startups and large multinationals alike.&quot;<br></div><div><div><br></di=
