Hi Josh and Hulda!

We definitely hear you about your concerns and agree that slack is maybe
not the best for all the tenants. We would however like to have a place to
compile information, resources and communication as a community board. That
way tenants can feel more empowered to be involved as a community online,
especially during this moment when we are unable to organize in person.

We are planning on communicating to tenants that cannot use slack via email
and maybe text, and are definitely willing to train people to use slack. We
are willing to try another method of communication other than slack if it
doesn't seem to be the best method. We want to have a way for tenants to
share and communicate rather than just through email. Emails can be
overwhelming if multiple tenants are emailing the whole list of people
involved rather than in a space dedicated to that specific discussion.

We are sending you both a slack invite so please join if you would like to
be more involved!

Best,
