I really like this, except for the idea of cultural debt - I much prefer
the idea that cultures can evolve between leadership and employees, rather
than any mismatch being characterized as =E2=80=9Cdebt.=E2=80=9D

Why don=E2=80=99t you take a shot at writing this? We can then take turns r=
evising
and then try to publish.
