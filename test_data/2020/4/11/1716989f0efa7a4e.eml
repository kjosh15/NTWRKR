I don=E2=80=99t know either. There are fields for:

2019 Total:
Salary, Wages, Commissions or Similar Compensation
2019 Total:
Cash Tips Or Equivalent
2019 Total:
Vacation, Family, Parental, Medical or Sick Leave
2019 Total:
Group Health Insurance
2019 Total:
Retirement Benefits
2019 Total:
State & Local Taxes On Employee Compensation
2019 Total:
Portion Of Wages In Excess Of $100,000/yr (1)
2019 Total:
Payments To Independent Contractors
2019 Total:
Payment To Sole Proprietor


The more you enter into these fields the bigger the grant. I'm calculating
wages by looking at money we transferred from our business account and
long-term savings accounts to our personal account over 2019. Any ideas on
how to fill in the rest?

After talking with GetDivvy they suggest including our 2018 taxes as
documentation and then seeing what they ask in followup. But having a =E2=
=80=9C0=E2=80=9D
for the grant amount (which is what you get if you only put in wages) won=
=E2=80=99t
result in much.
