I know we already talked this through on the phone, but here's my notes for
reference:

The CDC and WHO all indicate that the symptoms of Covid-19 are Fever,
Cough, and Shortness of breath.

Headaches, chills, body aches, diarrhea etc. are all sometimes associated,
but aren't what they look for - mostly because they happen much less of the
time. As a result, how about this as a framework:

a) If you're feeling really sick, isolate and let's observe and decide what
to do next. It may be the patient or the rest of us don't feel good about
the situation, in which case we can default to the CDC guidelines (below).
Or, we can give it a few days and revamp our assessment.

b) If you develop symptoms of Fever, Cough, or Shortness of Breath, we can
use the CDC guidelines, which are to isolate until:

You have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no
fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers)

AND

other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of
breath have improved)

AND

at least 7 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared

Obviously we're all making this up as we go along, but this ought to give
us a framework to start making decisions with.
