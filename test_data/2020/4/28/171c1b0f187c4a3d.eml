Long time no speak!! Congratulations on the CHRO role; we all knew it was
only a matter of time... :)

I'm writing as I spent the years since we last spoke developing a platform
for measuring employee behavior and beliefs in a statistically valid way *f=
rom
a values-led perspective*. Whereas most competor platforms are oriented
around gathering rough qualitative data that can tell a good story to
shareholders, we spent a lot of time developing data models to identify
bias and to give employees useful, actionable feedback ... and to do it in
a way that fosters psychological safety and empowers them to action.

Since COVID-19 struck we're seen an enormous uptick in the frequency and
intensity of use, and we quickly learned that it's because remote workers
have no view into how their team perceives their work, and managers no
longer have line of sight on their beliefs or behaviors. Couple that with
the massive increase in autonomy most workers are suddenly getting and our
platform turns out to be a real lifeline.

We're scaling up rapidly to meet this demand, but want to be really careful
to partner with clients who will help us drive towards becoming the company
we want to be. When I think back about our conversations way-back-when I
remember again and again being humbled and impressed with your insight,
candor, and willingness to adapt. That's the kind of clients we want to
work with through this crisis.

Let me know if you're game for a quick call to catch up and discuss, and I
hope you and yours are safe and healthy in this challenging time!

All best,
Josh
