Not sure what you're up to given the pandemic, but I hope you and yours are
safe and healthy!

Wanted to put a bug in your ear that I know a ton of folks in the culture,
business, and gov't communities in Iceland and that they're quite keen to
solicit filming projects. I'll be there starting mid-June. Let me know if I
can help in any way if shooting there sounds appealing!

All best,
Josh
