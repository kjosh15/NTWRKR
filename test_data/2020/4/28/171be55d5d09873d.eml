Glad to hear that you are going to Iceland this summer!   I think that will
do you and the family a world of good.  I am assuming that your living
space will be larger than what you have in NYC?  If so, then I would
imagine that alone will shift your perspective quite a bit which in turn
may help with the worry/anxiety.   To your question about uncertainty and
that it will be that way for quite a while - start with making the
uncertain, certain.  By that I mean live your life as though uncertainty is
the new, permanent normal.  If that is the case, then what about your
behavior is it you need to adjust?  Two parts - first - outside of a meteor
hitting the earth and complete and utter civil way/zombie apocalypse odds -
you are at any given moment probably safe, well fed, not in physical pain,
and not exposed to the elements.  Outside of some highly extreme and if
that temporary situations - that state of being is unlikely to change.
hard stop. remind yourself of that.  what has changed is your state of mind
and how you are coping with a lot of swirl.  Second - you have been a part
of the gig economy as long as I have known you Josh - you and your family
will be fine.  Don't plan for the future - just start behaving IN IT as
though it is here right now - that means innovating on how you market
yourself i.e. Geniecast for example, and thinking about which parts of your
insight to start emphasizing more of and in which medium.  I think the
culture piece is brilliant.  What about a version for your family unit?
What about a version for the type of culture you want to develop from
scratch with the new virtual homeschool clan a bunch of Mom's want to start
when they decide to leave the public school system?  What about posting all
of your journal entries as a blog or doing a VLOG at home with your family
and using the upcoming Iceland trip as an opportunity for an experiment
around culture? maybe between your kids and their Scandinavian cousins?
What about the crow work you did?  I am all over the place at the moment -
my point is - stop thinking about the future and just start doing it.  That
is how you deal with uncertainty - you make your own behavior disciplined
and stable as a means to get through it.  Kind of like diving into the wave
rather than letting it knock you over when it's too close to jump over.
You will be fine.  Deep breaths.
