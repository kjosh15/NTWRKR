So how's the pandemic treating you? I hope you and yours are weathering the
pandemic well! I'm five blocks from the epicenter of COVID-19 in NYC, so
it's been a real front row seat experience...

I wanted to put a bug in your ear that I've got a bunch of friends in
Iceland in the culture, gov't, and business communities and that they're
quite keen to have shooting projects over there. Right now Iceland is one
of the few places that's relatively safe and friendly for making TV, and
I'll be heading over mid-June (I've got citizenship there, so why not...!)

If you or anyone you know is interested in shooting something over there,
let me know how I can help. Hope you're well - catch me up when you get a
moment!

All best,
Josh
