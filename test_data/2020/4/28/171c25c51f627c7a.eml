Thanks so much for the conversation today - sorry I had to jet so suddenly
but my kids came home and I knew I'd forgotten to lock the door... ah, the
wonders of working from home!

Let me know how your conversation with Sydney goes and if I can provide any
more info. Happy to give you access to our sandbox, an overview deck, etc.
if that'd be helpful.

Still chewing on what you said about SARS, esp. wondering about how things
will progress going forward - i.e., that business travel will likely stay
down, but depending on the financial impact personal travel may go back
up... I guess we'll see one way or another!

All best wishes,
Josh
