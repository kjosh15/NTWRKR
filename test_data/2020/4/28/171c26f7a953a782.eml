I caught your W50 talk earlier today; I'm a special advisor and was
thrilled to hear your take on the importance of culture right now!

I'm writing as over the last couple years I've developed a platform for
gathering and statistically modeling peer-to-peer evaluations of behavior
using action statements derived from the core values of the organization.
We've got a ton of data and are seeing some really interesting shifts now
that everyone is going remote. Would this be an interesting  platform for
the work you're doing?

Let me know if it would be worth a followup conversation.

Many thanks!
Josh
