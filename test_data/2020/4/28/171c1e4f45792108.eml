You're just the most lovely person, Rachel - thank you so so much for
this!! Your approach is spot on, and pretty much what we've adopted. One of
the biggest gifts of this pandemic is in providing a crash course in living
with uncertainty. We had it before, but were able to pretend things were
much less uncertain than they were. Becoming comfortable with it is an
excellent base for living ongoing, especially as we age!

Can't thank you enough for being out there and being such a good friend.
Let me know if/how/what I can do to ever help return the favor!!

All best,
Josh
