Not sure what's going on in your part of the world vis a vis shooting, but
Iceland is one of the few safe, friendly places for it in the EU atm. I
know a ton of folks both in congress and the business community, and plan
to be there mid-June. Let me know if you have any projects that benefit
from a beautiful backdrop!

All best,
Josh
