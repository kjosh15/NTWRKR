First off, congrats on the producer / director credit - so cool!!! Saw that
coming a mile off...

Secondly, I hope you're weathering this pandemic well. I'm five blocks from
the epicenter of COVID-19 in NYC, so it's been a real front row seat
experience.

Lastly, since we last spoke I've gotten Icelandic citizenship and made
friends with a bunch of congresspeople there. Right now Iceland is one of
the few places that's relatively safe and friendly for making TV. Are you
or anyone you know interested in shooting something over there, and if so
how can I help?

Hope you're well - catch me up when you get a moment!

All best,
Josh
