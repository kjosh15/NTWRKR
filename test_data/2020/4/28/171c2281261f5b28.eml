Three offers:

1. I've been doing some work with an innovation firm that has a line on a
significant number of thermal cameras + software to do fever detection at
office and warehouse entrances. Based on the comments by Juan Enriquez
yesterday I'd be happy to connect any members that are interested.

2. My own startup offers a significant advantage to newly remote workers,
helping them see exactly what behaviors need improvement and giving
leadership a statistical model for managing them. I'm happy to offer the
next three months free during this crisis to World 50 members if you think
there would be interest - let me know!

3. Would a breakdown on track-and-trace technology, the privacy
implications, and the responsibilities the tech would entail be useful to
members? Out of all the content you guys have been providing the only gap
I've seen is in quick, actionable understanding of the technology involved.

And, of course, would love to do that podcast!

Hope you and yours are doing well,
- J
