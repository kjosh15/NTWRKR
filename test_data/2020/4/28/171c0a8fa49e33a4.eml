Hi Josh and Hulda,

Hope you are all well and safe.

I want to pick your brains. We have been looking at different ways of
moving forward with Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar this summer. I think we will =
have
plenty of Icelandic children and less children from abroad.

In a little brainstorming session with Alfrun my daughter about how we can
make sure Alexia gets better stimulated the idea came that we should do
regular zoom sessions with her. Following that I thought of an online
language school. We would start by developing this for Icelandic children
living abroad and if that works well we could possibly develop a tool for
different nationalities.

Before I run I wanted to ask you for an input and whether you could see
this as a beginning of a startup idea?

I would love to hear your thoughts. The initial steps will be to do a
Saturday morning or a Sunday afternoon school through Skype. It would be
done live so the children can interact with the app. 10 at the time and
they will have a teacher or two that speaks to them and guides them in the
theme or method we use. We would centre this in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur a=
nd with the
teachers we have there to start with and as part of Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6fr=
ar to
start with. But if the idea has a bigger potential I would be interested in
setting up a company with a couple of other people that would have
complimentary skills to build this on a bigger scale.

I look forward to hearing from you whether this is something that makes
sense or whether I am away with the fairies ;)

x
