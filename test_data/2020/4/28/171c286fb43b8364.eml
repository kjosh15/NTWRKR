There are a couple of RFID plays for Estee that help get the most out of
the new normal headed our way due to COVID.
1) BOPIS - buy online pick up in store is traditionally stronger in
segments other than beauty but it is likely to see an uptick. Knowing how
much inventory you have where and when is key for BOPIS, the value of a
good inventory in magnified when you broadcast to a customer that they can
come and pick it up.
2) Ship from store also has significant inventory visibility advantage
particularly if there is an unforeseen ecomm bump. UHF RFID enables
accurate local inventory counts
3) Store to Store - better management and allocation of inventory
4) Not sure there is a direct correlation but in apparel for fitting rooms
UHF is being explored as a way to confirm to customers/consumers that a
garment has been treated, sterilized or not yet tried on.
5) LiA - we have been working with Google on the LiA (local inventory ads)
initiative. this allows for local search online via google for inventory
and in stock items within brick and mortar.  similar to BOPIS but more
verify that it is available before I head into the retail space.
6) What is in your supply chain and where is another obvious one we already
covered.

There is an RFID project kicking off at Estee called Secure and Connect, I
believe this is being initiated by Chris Clark VP of GLobal Supply Chain at
Estee Lauder. Sounds like it is in the early exploratory stages.


Let me know if you have any questions
