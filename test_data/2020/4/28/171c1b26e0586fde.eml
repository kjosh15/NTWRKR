first thought; we recently ran some analytics showing that our qualitative =
questions increased employee engagement (in one use case)
 by more than 20% over just six week by pairing them with our expert system=
. I.e., we asked employees who were diverging from the company&#39;s measur=
ed values how they felt about the company - while giving them direct feedba=
ck from peers who were excelling in
 those areas. The result was an immediate and significant improvement in ho=
w they were dealing with said value. Given your goal of improving safety, t=

 and at scale, while producing a steady statistic for said improvement.<u><=

 Please find two docs attached:<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><br>
1. IndigoMetrics Demo Background 20190521.pdf: Login credentials to try the=
 platform as well as a walkthrough of its core functionality. Feel free to =
log in and do whatever you like to the platform as it is fully sandboxed.<b=

<br>
2. IndigoMetrics Oil and Gas 20191008.pdf: A case study of our work with an=
 Oil and Gas client focused on Oil Contractor safety behaviors.<br>
<br>
<br>
To answer a few points directly as discussed on the call:<br>
<br>
- We have quite a lot of experience working with participants that do not h=
ave a company email address. It requires us to keep on top of our SPF recor=
ds to minimize transfer to junk email but apart from that it works seamless=
ly.<br>
<br>
- We have found that we can accurately and consistently measure and quantif=
y any observable behavior. That matches well with the needs of an oil and g=
as company in that:<br>
=C2=A0<br>
a. Because it uses peer observation of behaviors (rather than management ob=
servation) it is well suited to distributed workforces and workforces that =
often operate out of sight of management.<br>
<br>
b. IndigoMetrics simplifies the process of behavior assessment to collect d=
ata in as short a time and in as enjoyable a way as possible by mimicking o=
nline survey UX patterns. This means that it&#39;s highly effective with wo=
rkforces that may be traditionally wary
 of behavioral systems or surveys. Examples of such workforces include spor=
ts teams and =E2=80=9Cblue collar=E2=80=9D workforces.<br>
<br>
c. IndigoMetrics has far greater reach than traditional management approach=
es and is able to provide consistent data across large oil and gas workforc=
es which can act as an early warning of future challenges and to provide di=
rection for ongoing training programs.<br>
<br>
Let us know if we can provide anything else and/or if you have any question=
s!<br>
