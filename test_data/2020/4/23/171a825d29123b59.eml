Weena,

You'd mentioned wanting to have a strategic plan. I spoke several weeks ago
with a very talented analyst friend of mine (also a HUGE prepper and
doomsday fanatic, but hey). He suggested two frameworks for
predicting/managing worst-case scenarios:

1) Consider bugging out if you see:

widespread infection / absenteeism in fire dept. and police force.
widespread stoppage of delivery trucks to enter city
striking by anyone in the food chain in the NYC area
significant loss of fundamental services (like electricity, phone, heat,
etc.)

2) In each case, use the following matrix to decide when/if to leave:

a) do you know WHY? (I.e, why the power went out?)
If not, trigger a next level response (i.e., flee)

b) If so, is the power outage local, regional, or national?
If > local, then trigger a next level response

I.e., if a significant drop in livability happens but you can't readily
determine why, there's systemic failure that is potentially dangerous.
Similarly, if the same happens but regionally, that too is evidence of
systemic failure that is potentially dangerous.

Hopefully this is useful - it comprises the bulk of what I've been looking
out for since the beginning of the pandemic.

All best,
Josh
