Thanks for the intro, Weena!

Dan, I=E2=80=99m working with Abbot (the ones who did the =E2=80=9C5 minute=
 COVID-19=E2=80=9D
tests. They=E2=80=99re looking for someone to set up clinical trials for th=
eir
continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) among non-insulin using diabetics to
show that their behavior can be changed. This would be a precursor to more
broad applicability for prediabetics, etc.

Trouble is, I=E2=80=99ve never built a full clinical trial by myself and un=
derstand
it=E2=80=99s as much art as science. Do you have 30m to quickly talk it ove=
r? At
this point I need exposure and vocabulary as much as anything else so I can
continue to upskill on my own.

Let me know if you have time for a brief call next week!!!

All best,
Josh
