I listened to Chris' W50 session yesterday and it occurred to me that he
might have some interesting ideas on how to use the psychometrics platform
I co-founded. We're seeing a HUGE uptick in interest given that it's
basically a lifeline for remote working teams to both understand and
improve how they collaborate.

It's been standard operating procedure since day one not to "sell from the
stage" with W50; is there an appropriate way to connect with Chris to see
if the platform is something he'd like to experiment with?

Similarly, we're considering offering the platform to select clients for
free to help support them through the pandemic. W50 has always been good to
me; is this something W50 would want to offer to its customers? (The
platform is traditionally B2B white-labeled.)

Hope you and yours are doing well!
- J
