Was thinking it might be worth publishing on medium or something, to get
feedback and improve it. Do you think so?

&gt; You&#39;d mentioned wanting to have a strategic plan. I spoke several =
weeks ago with a very talented analyst friend of mine (also a HUGE prepper =
and doomsday fanatic, but hey). He suggested two frameworks for predicting/=
managing worst-case scenarios:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1) Consider bugging out if you see:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; widespread infection / absenteeism in fire dept. and police force.<br>
&gt; widespread stoppage of delivery trucks to enter city<br>
&gt; striking by anyone in the food chain in the NYC area<br>
&gt; significant loss of fundamental services (like electricity, phone, hea=
t, etc.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2) In each case, use the following matrix to decide when/if to leave:<=
br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; a) do you know WHY? (I.e, why the power went out?)<br>
&gt; If not, trigger a next level response (i.e., flee)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; b) If so, is the power outage local, regional, or national?<br>
&gt; If &gt; local, then trigger a next level response<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I.e., if a significant drop in livability happens but you can&#39;t re=
adily determine why, there&#39;s systemic failure that is potentially dange=
rous. Similarly, if the same happens but regionally, that too is evidence o=
f systemic failure that is potentially dangerous.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hopefully this is useful - it comprises the bulk of what I&#39;ve been=
 looking out for since the beginning of the pandemic. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; All best,<br>
&gt; Josh<br>
