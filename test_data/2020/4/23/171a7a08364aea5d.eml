OK, I'll broker an intro shortly.

Family is doing ok; my older son (7 y.o.) is starting to feel the pinch -
he's really emotionally alert and recently revealed that he's known what's
in all the refrigerator trucks going by all along. Otherwise we're planning
to head to Iceland in June (the gov't has basically said they'll make sure
anyone who wants to return to the country can get there) and we'll see what
things look like for coming back in August...

Would love to talk to Geniecast! Understand you're underwater, so no
worries on timing.

Last thing to toss in the ring is that IndigoMetrics turns out to be tailor
made for remote workers and we're getting lots of interest from some very
big players (including one of the big four accounting firms). As a result
we're offering it for free for the next three months to select clients
(i.e., we really want to diversify before our client responsiveness causes
us to structure our roadmap for a single industry.) If you can think of any
way to use it, we'll get you set up ASAP. Not too transparently, we're
looking for impressive names to put on our client list. :)

Saw you sent another email, so will hit that one separate. Hope you're
well!!

- J
