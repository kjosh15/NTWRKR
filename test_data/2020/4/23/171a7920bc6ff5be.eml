Ran into John today; he mentioned that the cleaners should be coming in
three times a week, and that we should have the roof repaired within a
week. Is that all correct?

Otherwise, you still have our April check - please let me know what the
owners prefer for payment plans so we can see what's possible.

Thanks,
Josh
