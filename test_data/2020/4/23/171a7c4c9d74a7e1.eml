Josh -

Happy to chat any time this week or next.  To set expectations, I have
never been in charge of setting up a clinical trial but have been on teams
that have set them up and discuss them tangentially through various review
committees etc.  Also - don't know much about metabolism but will do my
best.

after 5 PCT or from 7:30-8-30 am PCT might work best for me.  most days
this week and next
