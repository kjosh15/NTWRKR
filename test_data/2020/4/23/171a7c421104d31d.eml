Hey Josh,

I'd love to be able to help but I'm a little hesitant to commit to such a
long time interval, especially since I will still have to spend nights at
my mom's during this time and I'm not sure where I stand with summer work.
Right now, I would be comfortable committing to two weeks; exactly when can
be up to you given Weena's friends who may be helping. If nothing else
works out, let me know (email works) because as the summer gets closer I'll
have a better idea of my schedule. Thanks!

Best,
Nick Tarr

P.S.- If its more convenient to give one of Weena's friends the whole time
block, that's also fine.

Hey Nick, am I right that you're pretty much fully flexible through the
summer? Also wanted to note that the cats can be a pain in the ass; they
have to be fed in the morning and evening (around 8am and 8pm), which kinda
kills evenings out. Of course, given the pandemic maybe that's not a thing
anymore. They also need to have the litter scooped daily b/c otherwise they
will shit on your bed. But otherwise - free apartment!!

Let us know if you've got any limitations / questions; if you can commit to
being here mid-June through August (unless we can find someone else who may
want to take the place while you're away - Weena knows of a few dancers,
for example) we can look at buying tickets. Let us know!

- J

P.S. I'm emailing you b/c that's the contact info your dad gave me (plus
all my stodgy old business contacts only use email and fax...) If there's a
better way to contact you, let me know!
