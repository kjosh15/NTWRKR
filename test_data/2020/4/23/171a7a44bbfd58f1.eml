Hey Nick, am I right that you're pretty much fully flexible through the
summer? Also wanted to note that the cats can be a pain in the ass; they
have to be fed in the morning and evening (around 8am and 8pm), which kinda
kills evenings out. Of course, given the pandemic maybe that's not a thing
anymore. They also need to have the litter scooped daily b/c otherwise they
will shit on your bed. But otherwise - free apartment!!

Let us know if you've got any limitations / questions; if you can commit to
being here mid-June through August (unless we can find someone else who may
want to take the place while you're away - Weena knows of a few dancers,
for example) we can look at buying tickets. Let us know!

- J

P.S. I'm emailing you b/c that's the contact info your dad gave me (plus
all my stodgy old business contacts only use email and fax...) If there's a
better way to contact you, let me know!
