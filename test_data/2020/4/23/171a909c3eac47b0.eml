Thanks - I'm just glad my folks are not simultaneously going through the
same thing - and they have each other.   She is still at home.  She really
needs to be at a care facility or at least having someone come in several
times a week.  COVID just complicated the transition.  Rest of the family
is doing pretty well.  I'm steeling myself for no camp and no school next
year either.. How about you guys?
Best,
Rachel
