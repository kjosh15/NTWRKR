Ron called me yesterday and was asking questions and giving his thoughts =
on the future and based on that I figured he=E2=80=99d fit right into =
this group. I sent out a calendar invite for another zoom session next =
Friday, same time as yesterday.

I also wanted to share a couple of pieces that ring my bell, and I think =
will resonate with the rest of you given our recent discussions.

Stay Strong,

VIRUS LAYS BARE THE FRAILTY OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT
https://www.ft.com/content/7eff769a-74dd-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca

If there is a silver lining to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that it has =
injected a sense of togetherness into polarised societies. But the =
virus, and the economic lockdowns needed to combat it, also shine a =
glaring light on existing inequalities =E2=80=94 and even create new =
ones. Beyond defeating the disease, the great test all countries will =
soon face is whether current feelings of common purpose will shape =
society after the crisis. As western leaders learnt in the Great =
Depression, and after the second world war, to demand collective =
sacrifice you must offer a social contract that benefits everyone.

Today=E2=80=99s crisis is laying bare how far many rich societies fall =
short of this ideal. Much as the struggle to contain the pandemic has =
exposed the unpreparedness of health systems, so the brittleness of many =
countries=E2=80=99 economies has been exposed, as governments scramble =
to stave off mass bankruptcies and cope with mass unemployment. Despite =
inspirational calls for national mobilisation, we are not really all in =
this together.

The economic lockdowns are imposing the greatest cost on those already =
worst off. Overnight millions of jobs and livelihoods have been lost in =
hospitality, leisure and related sectors, while better paid knowledge =
workers often face only the nuisance of working from home. Worse, those =
in low-wage jobs who can still work are often risking their lives =E2=80=94=
 as carers and healthcare support workers, but also as shelf stackers, =
delivery drivers and cleaners.

Governments=E2=80=99 extraordinary budget support for the economy, while =
necessary, will in some ways make matters worse. Countries that have =
allowed the emergence of an irregular and precarious labour market are =
finding it particularly hard to channel financial help to workers with =
such insecure employment. Meanwhile, vast monetary loosening by central =
banks will help the asset-rich. Behind it all, underfunded public =
services are creaking under the burden of applying crisis policies.

The way we wage war on the virus benefits some at the expense of others. =
The victims of Covid-19 are overwhelmingly the old. But the biggest =
victims of the lockdowns are the young and active, who are asked to =
suspend their education and forgo precious income. Sacrifices are =
inevitable, but every society must demonstrate how it will offer =
restitution to those who bear the heaviest burden of national efforts.

Radical reforms =E2=80=94 reversing the prevailing policy direction of =
the last four decades =E2=80=94 will need to be put on the table. =
Governments will have to accept a more active role in the economy. They =
must see public services as investments rather than liabilities, and =
look for ways to make labour markets less insecure. Redistribution will =
again be on the agenda; the privileges of the elderly and wealthy in =
question. Policies until recently considered eccentric, such as basic =
income and wealth taxes, will have to be in the mix.

The taboo-breaking measures governments are taking to sustain businesses =
and incomes during the lockdown are rightly compared to the sort of =
wartime economy western countries have not experienced for seven =
decades. The analogy goes still further.

The leaders who won the war did not wait for victory to plan for what =
would follow. Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill issued the =
Atlantic Charter, setting the course for the United Nations, in 1941. =
The UK published the Beveridge Report, its commitment to a universal =
welfare state, in 1942. In 1944, the Bretton Woods conference forged the =
postwar financial architecture. That same kind of foresight is needed =
today. Beyond the public health war, true leaders will mobilise now to =
win the peace.=
