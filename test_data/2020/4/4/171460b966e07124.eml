Thanks, Jen! We're doing well - ten minutes from the epicenter of the
epicenter, but are either asymptomatic, have already had it, or don't have
it. Total schr=C3=B6dinger's cat here, as with much of the country...

Sorry to hear about Leah; is she doing ok, or does is it tough going? We've
paired up with another family whose kids go to the same school and it's
helped a ton; the kids go to one house or the other for school each day and
seem to be loving it.

How about yourselves? Any sign Seattle is getting widespread enough testing
for a next step?

All best,
Josh
