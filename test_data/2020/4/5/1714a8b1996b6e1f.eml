So good to hear from you!! And especially glad to hear you're all safe and
well - but what is a bee "super"?

We're sitting in the epicenter of the epicenter, and it's quite a view on
the potential shifts in the world. Yesterday I got a call from an old
friend in Bangalore, who said he'd seen news about NYC and was worried
about me.

Overall we're doing very well; we made a cell with a neighboring family
with two lovely kids from the same school as Othinn, and the kids rotate
from house to house for schoolwork in the morning and then outside
adventures and projects in the afternoon. The woman from the other couple
is a certified movement therapist, professional dancer, yoga instructor,
etc. etc., and none of the children dare cross Hulda, so my wife does the
morning shift and then they all get to do adventures all afternoon. They
kids seem to love it - there is enough distance from another family being
around that everyone has a little variety in their interactions, and they
don't seem to be clamoring for all the extracurriculars which previously
filled so much time.

In a way this pandemic has been a gift, giving us all a pause to stop and
come together and revel in the underpinnings of our lives together. We're
not rushing off to Taekwando or Ukulele class, or hustling in and out of
subways... instead there is much more drawing and storytelling (and
cleaning, and cooking, and all the other stuff of life.)

We think of you all often, especially as we settle in to read together with
a hot cup of tea. We're not on a lovely farm in Wales, but in many ways the
community and the way people are drawing together here mean we wouldn't
want to be anywhere else (at least at the moment - we'll see what happens
with the larger socio economic shocks!) We're curious people, and what is
emerging here may be the first signs of how the world can change for the
better.

Oh, and my folks seem to be completely amenable to the pandemic; they moved
to Walla Walla some time ago and are loving their little cabin in the
woods. Mom can't get Dad to stop talking to cashiers (and anyone else who
will listen) when they do go to the stores, but I think we've convinced him
to at least wear a mask while he does it.

xoxo,
Josh
