*Top takeaways and action items *

There=E2=80=99s still tremendous uncertainty about COVID-19 and the duratio=
n of its
impact. Referring to a graph of coronavirus deaths by country, Juan
Enr=C3=ADquez noted that it=E2=80=99s going to =E2=80=9Cget worse before it=
 gets better,=E2=80=9D while
Ian Goldin described the current situation as =E2=80=9Cthe beginning of the
beginning, not the beginning of the end.=E2=80=9D

*Bob Eckert outlined that most companies will experience three fundamental
phases during a crisis. *

   - *Crisis phase. *=E2=80=9CRecognize that all of us=E2=80=94whether it=
=E2=80=99s your employees,
   your customers, your bosses, your board of directors, your investors=E2=
=80=94we are
   all right now working in the bottom two rungs of Maslow=E2=80=99s hierar=
chy. =E2=80=A6 It=E2=80=99s
   critical to understand: That=E2=80=99s where all of us are coming from.=
=E2=80=9D How should
   members lead during this phase? =E2=80=9CYou cannot overly communicate, =
especially
   to employees and customers. They really appreciate and value transparenc=
y
   right now.=E2=80=9D He recommended hosting twice daily meetings to align=
 teams
   across the global with a central message and mission. And even during th=
is
   first phase, he said, =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s worthwhile to think through =
phase three, the
   new normal.=E2=80=9D
   - *Transition or recovery.* =E2=80=9CFirst, look at history. How did you=
r
   business respond, for example, to the 2008 recession, and how quickly di=
d
   it come back? And secondly, build models and scenarios, using a variety =
of
   assumptions and sensitivities. Stress-test the downside. What if it=E2=
=80=99s a
   very long, slow recovery? How do you get from here to there?=E2=80=9D
   - *The new normal.* =E2=80=9CI know my new normal and interactions will =
be
   different,=E2=80=9D said Eckert. He encouraged members to think about wh=
at actions
   they can be taking today to influence how the new normal is shaped in th=
eir
   favor.

*And there are still key things leaders can do today. *

   - *Three traits of leaders :: *As Bob Eckert said: =E2=80=9CA leader doe=
s three
   things: A leader defines reality correctly, paints a vision for the futu=
re
   and motivates people to get from here to there.=E2=80=9D These traits ar=
e more
   important now, since many trust their employers more than governments fo=
r
   information about the Coronavirus.
   - *=E2=80=9CAll bets are off=E2=80=9D :: *According to Bill George: =E2=
=80=9CYou don't have
   certainty. What should you communicate? In uncertain situations, just te=
ll
   [shareholders], =E2=80=98This is what we=E2=80=99re going to do. We=E2=
=80=99re going to come out of
   this winning; we=E2=80=99re going to come out of it roaring. We=E2=80=99=
re changing our
   strategy to be the winner coming out of it.=E2=80=99 But don=E2=80=99t g=
ive earnings
   guidance.=E2=80=9D
   - *Be transparent in communications ::* =E2=80=9CWhen you communicate wi=
th your
   employees...think of this a little bit like doing quarterly reports ever=
y
   week,=E2=80=9D Enriquez said. =E2=80=9CYou want to under-promise and ove=
r-deliver.=E2=80=9D The
   pandemic will worsen in the U.S. over the next few weeks before it begin=
s
   to improve, and the media firestorm will be relentless. Companies that a=
re
   honest with their employees and realistic about this are =E2=80=9Cfar le=
ss likely
   to be embarrassed or to be overwhelmed by this stuff.=E2=80=9D People ca=
n handle
   bad news, but they need to know the truth. Greg Creed, former CEO, Yum!
   Brands, added: =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think anyone will ever accuse yo=
u of
   overcommunicating. Even if you think you=E2=80=99re communicating a lot,=
 my guess
   is you=E2=80=99re probably not because people really want to hear you. T=
hey want to
   be reassured; they want to know if we=E2=80=99re going to come out on th=
e other
   side.=E2=80=9D
   - *Think about your restart now ::* Even though the next two to four
   weeks will be frightening as coronavirus spreads in the U.S., Enr=C3=ADq=
uez
   encouraged members to start thinking ahead to the future. =E2=80=9CYou=
=E2=80=99ve got to
   start thinking about where you=E2=80=99re going to restart. Where is the=
 pent-up
   demand? How hard were my consumers hit?=E2=80=9D

*We=E2=80=99re going to see a =E2=80=9Creal, deep recession,=E2=80=9D says =
Bill George. =E2=80=9CYou need
to really batten down the hatches and grab for every dime of cash you can
get.=E2=80=9D*

   - *Cash is king :: *Drawing on his experience with Goldman Sachs during
   the 2008 financial crisis, George urged members to store up as much
   liquidity as possible. =E2=80=9CCash is going to be king or queen, if yo=
u will.=E2=80=9D He
   suggested that members slow their payables, collect as much revenue as
   possible, and take in as much credit from as many banks as they can. He
   gave the caveat, however, that there are two areas where organizations
   should hesitate to pull back too much: dividends and front-line employee=
s.
   =E2=80=9CIf you have to, to survive, cut your dividends. =E2=80=A6 But i=
n the order of
   priority, that would be at the low end,=E2=80=9D he said. As far as fron=
t-line
   employees are concerned, he encouraged members to =E2=80=9Chonor them,=
=E2=80=9D citing as
   evidence the fact that the major corporations that haven=E2=80=99t done =
so have
   experienced strikes. =E2=80=9CIf there are pay cuts, you should take the=
m. They
   should start at the top with the CEO.=E2=80=9D
   - *Hold on the earnings guidance :: *=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re just going =
to look like a
   fool if you give earnings guidance,=E2=80=9D said George. In an environm=
ent rife
   with such uncertainty, it has become impossible to give shareholders the
   kinds of projections they=E2=80=99re seeking. =E2=80=9CIn uncertain situ=
ations, just tell
   [shareholders], =E2=80=98This is what we=E2=80=99re going to do. We=E2=
=80=99re going to come out of
   this winning. We=E2=80=99re going to come out of it roaring. We=E2=80=99=
re changing our
   strategy to be the winner coming out of it.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

As organizations have shifted their teams and operations to remote working
over the last couple weeks, many have struggled to find their new
normal. *Github
co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij shared perspectives on leading a
100-percent remote work company *and how members can adapt during this
critical time.

   - *Think beyond the tools to the cultural shift technology enables :: *I=
t=E2=80=99s
   simple enough to transition in-person meetings to Zoom and hallway
   conversations to Slack, but Sijbrandij encouraged members to think about
   embracing the broader cultural shifts they enable. =E2=80=9CFor example,=
 not
   everything that is a meeting today probably has to be a meeting,=E2=80=
=9D he said,
   adding that digital tools have also pushed Github to be more intentional
   about how they communicate and the guidelines they use internally.
   - *Here=E2=80=99s what that looks like practically :: *=E2=80=9CEvery ti=
me we have a
   meeting, there's a Google doc that has the agenda, but we also take live
   notes during the meeting in line with the agenda so that there's kind of=
 a
   good construct of what's being discussed, what's being concluded,=E2=80=
=9D he said.
   =E2=80=9CIt makes it easier to follow the meeting later on. It also make=
s it easier
   for everyone to be on the same playing field asking a question.=E2=80=9D

   - =E2=80=9CWhat I do know: *Do the exact opposite of what others are doi=
ng. *If
   you have a strong balance sheet, as people are retrenching, this is an
   opportunity to expand or buy. If people are laying off, this is the best
   time to hire the best people out there. This is how you build a stronger
   company in the long term. Everyone is panicking and the long term will b=

   what it is. Who knows how long? But what we do know is it always goes ba=

</strong></span><br>
<br>
<span style=3D"font-size:14px">There=E2=80=99s still tremendous uncertainty=
 about COVID-19 and the duration of its impact. Referring to a graph of cor=
onavirus deaths by country, Juan Enr=C3=ADquez noted that it=E2=80=99s goin=
g to =E2=80=9Cget worse before it gets better,=E2=80=9D while Ian Goldin de=
scribed the current situation as =E2=80=9Cthe beginning of the beginning, n=
ot the beginning of the end.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0<br>
<br>
<strong>Bob Eckert outlined that most companies will experience three funda=
mental phases during a crisis.=C2=A0</strong></span>

<ul>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>Crisis phase. </strong>=E2=80=
=9CRecognize that all of us=E2=80=94whether it=E2=80=99s your employees, yo=
ur customers, your bosses, your board of directors, your investors=E2=80=94=
we are all right now working in the bottom two rungs of Maslow=E2=80=99s hi=
erarchy. =E2=80=A6 It=E2=80=99s critical to understand: That=E2=80=99s wher=
e all of us are coming from.=E2=80=9D How should members lead during this p=
hase? =E2=80=9CYou cannot overly communicate, especially to employees and c=
ustomers. They really appreciate and value transparency right now.=E2=80=9D=
 He recommended hosting twice daily meetings to align teams across the glob=
al with a central message and mission. And even during this first phase, he=
 said, =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s worthwhile to think through phase three, the n=
ew normal.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</span></li>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>Transition or recovery.</strong=
> =E2=80=9CFirst, look at history. How did your business respond, for examp=
le, to the 2008 recession, and how quickly did it come back? And secondly, =
build models and scenarios, using a variety of assumptions and sensitivitie=
s. Stress-test the downside. What if it=E2=80=99s a very long, slow recover=
y? How do you get from here to there?=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</span></li>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>The new normal.</strong> =E2=80=
=9CI know my new normal and interactions will be different,=E2=80=9D said E=
ckert. He encouraged members to think about what actions they can be taking=
 today to influence how the new normal is shaped in their favor.=C2=A0</spa=
n></li>
</ul>
<span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>And there are still key things leade=
rs can do today.=C2=A0</strong></span>

<ul>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>Three traits of leaders :: </st=
rong>As Bob Eckert said: =E2=80=9CA leader does three things: A leader defi=
nes reality correctly, paints a vision for the future and motivates people =
to get from here to there.=E2=80=9D These traits are more important now, si=
nce many trust their employers more than governments for information about =
the Coronavirus.</span></li>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>=E2=80=9CAll bets are off=E2=80=
=9D :: </strong>According to Bill George: =E2=80=9CYou don&#39;t have certa=
inty. What should you communicate? In uncertain situations, just tell [shar=
eholders], =E2=80=98This is what we=E2=80=99re going to do. We=E2=80=99re g=
oing to come out of this winning; we=E2=80=99re going to come out of it roa=
ring. We=E2=80=99re changing our strategy to be the winner coming out of it=
.=E2=80=99 But don=E2=80=99t give earnings guidance.=E2=80=9D</span></li>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>Be transparent in communication=
s ::</strong> =E2=80=9CWhen you communicate with your employees...think of =
this a little bit like doing quarterly reports every week,=E2=80=9D Enrique=
z said. =E2=80=9CYou want to under-promise and over-deliver.=E2=80=9D The p=
andemic will worsen in the U.S. over the next few weeks before it begins to=
 improve, and the media firestorm will be relentless. Companies that are ho=
nest with their employees and realistic about this are =E2=80=9Cfar less li=
kely to be embarrassed or to be overwhelmed by this stuff.=E2=80=9D People =
can handle bad news, but they need to know the truth. Greg Creed, former CE=
O, Yum! Brands, added: =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think anyone will ever accu=
se you of overcommunicating. Even if you think you=E2=80=99re communicating=
 a lot, my guess is you=E2=80=99re probably not because people really want =
to hear you. They want to be reassured; they want to know if
we=E2=80=99re going to come out on the other side.=E2=80=9D</span></li>
	<li><span style=3D"font-size:14px"><strong>Think about your restart now ::=
