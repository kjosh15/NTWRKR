Sweets,

Here are the current opps in line. There is:


   1. one short-term project (BTeam)
   2. one highly likely candidate near-term (Normative)
   3. one likely candidate longer-term (Abbot)
   4. two long-term maybe corporations in process (Apple, Google)
   5. three maybe/possibly candidate (Korn Ferry, Halma, BP's Launchpad)

Timing:

   1. BTeam will give a yes/no in the next two weeks
   2. Normative is likely to make an offer in the next two weeks
   3. Korn Ferry, Halma, and BP could happen anytime in the next month
   4. Abbott may/may not move quickly in the next month
   5. Apple and Google will likely be 3-6 months to an offer


xoxo,
Josh
