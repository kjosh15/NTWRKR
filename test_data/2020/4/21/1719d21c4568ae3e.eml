Hey Nick, am I right that you're pretty much fully flexible through the
summer? Also wanted to note that the cats can be a pain in the ass; they
have to be fed in the morning and evening (around 8am and 8pm), which kinda
kills evenings out. Of course, given the pandemic maybe that's not a thing
anymore. They also need to have the litter scooped daily b/c otherwise they
will shit on your bed. But otherwise - free apartment!!

Let us know if you've got any limitations / questions to address as we look
at tickets.

- J
