Totally understand. Right now we're looking to get tickets from mid-June
through the end of August, and are hoping to buy them soon. Once we do
we'll have exact dates to work with you around.

You can see pics of the place here:
https://www.homeexchange.com/homes/view/1457293

Take some time to get through the week and let us know when you're clearer
on what would work for you!

All best,
Josh
