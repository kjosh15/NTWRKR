Glad you're doing well!! We're in JH, watching it all unfold. Gotta say
that seeing my own kids flourish under the new, less structured regime has
definitely been an eye-opener.

I'm looking for contracts where I can help companies capitalize on this
narrow window of time when they can leapfrog new technologies, but more
specifically I'm pushing my startup (indigometrics.com) to help companies
with newly-remote workers. We're essentially a lifeline for employees who
need to know where they stand with their teams and what to work on to
collaborate better, and employers who no longer have line-of-site on what
their employees believe and/or are doing - all done in a way that respects
privacy and creates better outcomes.

Let me know how I can support you guys beyond just getting the word out!!

All best,
Josh
