Lyn,

Just wanted to follow up to say that your advice has followed me since you
wrote - "Generally things turn out to be not as bad as you feared but not
as good as you hoped." It's been quite reassuring as it is, most of all, a
reasonable hypothesis!

To that end we're doing our best as NYC hits what we hope is its peak. As
we live not five blocks from the epicenter of the epicenter in the US we've
been doing our best to see the positive, and not least of that is a front
row seat to how people may be able to live with this (and threats like it)
in the future. And it *is* interesting!! Most important of all, of course,
is that people are pulling together and you can see, now more than ever,
the beauty in the communities we've found ourselves a part of.

In any event we're very pleased to hear you're well and thriving. I can
only imagine the impact you've had on your to do list! Our boys here are
consuming most of our time, which we're quite happy with, but we're getting
a few little projects wrapped up here and there.

All best wishes and lots of love,
Josh & Hulda
