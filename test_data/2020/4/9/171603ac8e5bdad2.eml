I completely botched pitching this to you previously - apologies. More
properly this time:


I'm submitting an opinion piece arguing that most companies are responding
to the pandemic-prompted shift to remote work by trying to exert more
digital control over workers. This is going to hurt them for both technical
and behavioral reasons. Moreover, there is huge opportunity in creating
specific types of technical support for newly autonomous employees.

What's counterintuitive about this is that the technical support needed is
in empowering employees even further, and specifically in empowering them
to communicate between each other over behavioral metrics - not up or down
the management hierarchy.

Managers need to know this because we're in a very narrow window of
unprecedented technology adoption, and first movers will see significant
advantage long-term -  especially as we come out of COVID-19 disruption.

This work builds on my last two books - Reputation Economics (McMillan) and
Hacking Work (Penguin) - as well as my consulting work to Fortune-400
executives from BP to Ford to Merck. Additionally, I co-founded
IndigoMetrics, a company focused in statistically modeling employee
behavior engagement and alignment, and have been working in this space for
the last four years.

I've already written the entire article and can send it to you for review
for exclusive publication at your convenience.

Many thanks,
Josh Klein
