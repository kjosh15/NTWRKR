Sweets,

Here are the current opps in line. There is:

   - one highly likely candidate near-term (Normative)
   - one likely candidate longer-term (Abbot)
   - one maybe/possibly candidate (Korn Ferry)
   - two long-term maybe corporation in process (Google, Apple)

Normative is likely to make an offer in the next two weeks
Korn Ferry could happen anytime in the next few months.
Abbott may/may not move quickly in the next month
Google and Apple will likely be 3-6 months to an offer

xoxo,
Josh
