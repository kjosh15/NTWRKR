Yes, we have been thinking of you all Josh! We had not realised when I last
wrote just how central you are to all this, as we hadn't been out to get a
paper. What sort of lockdown have they got over there? Can you go out at
all for exercise? It is going to be rather difficult over the next few
months when the temperature goes up in NY. I suppose there is no chance of
flying off to Iceland this time! What a shame you were not over there when
all this broke out, as I imagine they will deal with it very sensibly
there. THe Icelanders seem to be very sensible people!.
 My work with the refugees is, of course, totally curtailed for the moment,
though we keep in touch  by email. I got   a message from a friend of mine,
Ken BLack, who has made  a video of himself with some activities to keep
the kids occupied. Some require a garden, at the beginning, but he goes on
to things you  can do indoors. IN fact the  string one could be modified
for indoors, I guess. Anyway, I will forward it to you.
 We are sending you much love and prayers for your well being. YOu are all
very young and very fit!.  We have a friend in the village here who has
caught the virus. He is 85, asthmatic and had cancer two years ago. He went
into hospital in Worcester last week, and is now getting better! Yay! His
name is Ben. Please pray for his continued recovery.
 I trust that Karen and JOel are both doing OK over there in the country?
Do send them big hugs from us both
 With much love to you all
Lyn and Robin
Lyn
