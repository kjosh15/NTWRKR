Do you think Rivel could use a short Q&A session with me about the future
of work and how the risks inherent in assuming "everything will go back to
normal" (around how employees work remotely or not) are bigger than most
realize... and the opportunity is greater? Didn't want to offer if you
didn't think it would be well recieved and/or if there's another angle to
play on it, such as doing a video talk or something.
