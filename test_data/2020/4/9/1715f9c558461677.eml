I'm sure you have your hands full with coronavirus topics, but was
wondering if anyone has talked specifically about the peculiar Overton
window of adoption we're looking at and how it's shifting the balance of
power for workers of all types.

I'd love to get some air time if we can find something to talk about - let
me know if you have 20m for me to pitch some ideas to you!
