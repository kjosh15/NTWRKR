Hi,

How are you? Also where are you? Didja leave NYC?

Thanks for the email check in earlier. Good to hear from you.

We're cooped up at home with the baby. Liza had symptoms and a likely COVID
diagnosis. She's mostly better now. Will come out of isolation on the
bedroom tomorrow. Then 14 days at home for me on symptom watch.

But all in all doing fine. Yes, overrun with virus econ stories.

Always enjoy your ideas and pitches. Maybe we do a call tomorrow.

What we need at this moment is a) a huge question everyone needs us to
answer like where does 2 Trillion come from? Or a character doing things
now that we can hear about and see, like the ventilator episode.

Anyway, I've been interrupted by the twerp twice while typing this. So
that's my life now.

Hope you're well.

Alex
