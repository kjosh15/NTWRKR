I=E2=80=99m starting to think about the next set of guideposts to planning. I=
nitially we developed a set for if/when to flee the city. Then we made a set=
 for going to iceland (and are executing on it!) Now we can start thinking a=
bout what to watch for to make choices post-summer, and I think this article=
 really articulated what will be needed. Let me know what you think!

Xoxo,
