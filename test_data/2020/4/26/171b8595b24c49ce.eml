takeaways and action items *

*Acceleration was a top-line theme* of World 50 conversations this week.
Despite the ongoing unpredictability caused by COVID-19=E2=80=94from global
economic fallout and supply chain disruptions to geopolitical tensions and
more=E2=80=94special guests reminded members that the pandemic has primaril=
y
fast-tracked geopolitical and economic trends we were already seeing. But,
how are those themes unfolding in a COVID-19 world, and what are the
implications leaders should be aware of?

   - *Globalization :: *R.P. Eddy says we=E2=80=99re not going to shift awa=
y from
   globalization. =E2=80=9CThere's way too much efficiency already found an=
d too many
   businesses=E2=80=94and entire nations=E2=80=94fundamentally built on glo=
balization,=E2=80=9D he
   said. But he pointed out two trends related to China that he expects wil=
l
   accelerate:
      - a decrease in the reliance on China, itself an effect of another
      accelerating trend: the tension between the Asian nation and the U.S.
      - a shift in what we consider =E2=80=9Ccritical infrastructure,=E2=80=
=9D which has
      historically meant water, food, electricity, telecommunications, etc.=
 but
      should perhaps include pharmaceuticals, too.
      - Elsewhere, Bruce Mehlman said, =E2=80=9CThere is an excessive level=
 of
      dependence that, clearly, policymakers are going to want to shed when=
 it
      comes to emerging technologies now, but also lifesaving and
critical things
      such as health care supplies you're seeing around the world as well.=
=E2=80=9D
   - *If not China, then who? :: *As China faces backlash for its lack of
   transparency in sharing COVID-19 information with the rest of the world,
   many are wondering if it=E2=80=99s time to decouple from the country. Wh=
ile no
   individual country can displace China completely, Mehlman says that seve=
ral
   APAC nations that play by the traditional, multilateral rules of the WTO
   can create meaningful opportunities to offset Chinese dominance, pointin=
g
   to South Korea and Japan in particular, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia.
   - *The game-changer in Hong Kong ::* Elizabeth Economy pointed to
   Beijing=E2=80=99s increasing influence in Hong Kong=E2=80=99s judicial s=
ystem, which
   experts and democracy activists say will weaken the "one country, two
   systems" framework. Experts and democracy activists have pinned their ho=
pes
   on an independent judicial system, but Beijing=E2=80=99s new representat=
ive in the
   SAR is increasingly arguing that the rule of law has to be in service of
   the Chinese communist party. =E2=80=9CThat's a game-changer,=E2=80=9D Ec=
onomy said. =E2=80=9CThe
   basic law is not supposed to run out for another few decades, but I thin=
k
   this process is very much being accelerated right now.=E2=80=9D
   - *Backlash against tech :: *Mehlman says the rising policy, privacy,
   and cybersecurity concerns over market dominance of technology
   players=E2=80=94especially in the EU, but also in the United States=E2=
=80=94will be bigger
   issues in the future, especially since technology companies will be key =
to
   contact tracing and other recovery protocols. =E2=80=9CI don't believe t=
hat the
   genuine help for the world, for which they should be applauded, buys the=
m a
   get-out-of-antitrust-jail-free card,=E2=80=9D he said.
   - *The domino effect of remote work :: *Remote work was already a
   growing trend among organizations, particularly in Asia, says Su-Yen Won=
g.
   But there are more positive outcomes of remote workplaces than just
   allowing your teams to continue working when they can=E2=80=99t travel p=
hysically:
   The focus on performance and output, as opposed to just input, will also
   improve diversity, whether it=E2=80=99s better empowering working mother=
s or
   disabled communities, or expanding the talent pool from a recruiting
   perspective.


While geopolitical and economic trends may be playing out at an accelerated
speed, *leadership in a COVID-19 world (and after) may require blue-sky
thinking*. As Juan Enr=C3=ADquez told members: =E2=80=9CWe may return to no=
rmal in terms
of our permission to go outside, but the reason why we're having this talk
this week=E2=80=94and next week, and the week after that=E2=80=94on what do=
es the world
look like is because it has shifted so absolutely fundamentally in economic
terms, in power terms and in the trust in each other. And I don't think
that's a speed bump that we're going to forget for a couple of years at
least.=E2=80=9D Special guests shared perspectives on leading during=E2=80=
=94and
after=E2=80=94challenging times:

   - *There=E2=80=99s no going back ::* Leaders need to recognize that the =
goal
   isn=E2=80=99t to get back to normal, but to plan through this crisis int=
o an
   unknowable future. It=E2=80=99s an uncomfortable truth, said Chris Fusse=
ll, but the
   companies that make the hard pivot into whatever new world arises will b=
e
   better situated than those that try to revert to old systems. This won=
=E2=80=99t be
   the last decentralized and uncertain crisis, and companies need to
   reimagine their organizational structures to reflect that. Fussell advis=
ed
   members to *plan against =E2=80=9Cbig rocks=E2=80=9D*=E2=80=94massive po=
tential hurdles that
   they could face in the near- to midterm future=E2=80=94and create contin=
gency plans
   for the possible outcomes. Fashion retailers, for example, could game pl=
an
   around the possibility that students don=E2=80=99t go back to school in =
the fall.
   How would that affect fall fashion lines and manufacturing? How would th=
e
   business model shift to respond? After several of these exercises, a new=
,
   more adaptable business model should take shape.
   - *Focus on =E2=80=9Cno-regrets,=E2=80=9D not =E2=80=9C100% correct=E2=
=80=9D decisions :: *Because the
   world is moving at =E2=80=9Cwarp speed=E2=80=9D in light of the pandemic=
, Ron Williams
   encouraged members to quit worrying about being =E2=80=9Cabsolutely 100%=
 correct,=E2=80=9D
   and to instead focus on making =E2=80=9Cno-regrets moves.=E2=80=9D To di=
scern what those
   moves are, ask, =E2=80=9CWhat are the things that are going to be fundam=
entally
   important to do?=E2=80=9D For instance, he said, make sure that IT incur=
sions are
   being heavily monitored and that cybersecurity is as =E2=80=9Chardened=
=E2=80=9D as can be.
   - *On communicating with the board during a crisis :: *Don=E2=80=99t jus=
t read
   the pages, Williams advised members. It=E2=80=99s one of the biggest mis=
takes he
   sees management make. Start with the assumption that the board has read
   everything, and take the time to =E2=80=9Creally crystallize the critica=
l strategic
   issues=E2=80=9D in order to provide a brief executive summary and be ful=
ly prepared
   for the board to ask questions. =E2=80=9CYou should always feel comforta=
ble being
   highly transparent, communicating the really critical issues and
   vulnerabilities that the organization has.=E2=80=9D
   - *Expect consumer behavior to change rapidly=E2=80=94often without warn=
ing ::* In
   part six of his call series with members, Enr=C3=ADquez said we=E2=80=99=
re now entering
   a new world and that consumer behavior can spike up and down in really
   unpredictable ways. =E2=80=9CThat means that your market intelligence an=
d your
   ability to understand where the consumer is going becomes absolutely
   critical, because you're not going to open the doors and find the same
   consumer.=E2=80=9D
   - *=E2=80=9CThis is a humongous moment for more heart=E2=80=94and to use=
 the heart on
   yourself=E2=80=9D* :: As leaders navigate this unprecedented pandemic an=
d its
   very real consequences=E2=80=94from sick employees to potential job loss=
es and
   more=E2=80=94Eddy offered a few suggestions for members during this time=
.
      - Forgive yourself. =E2=80=9CYou're going to fail; you're going to ge=
t
      fatigued.=E2=80=9D
      - Have a very clear daily regime.
      - Replace yourself. =E2=80=9CRealize you're going to get burned down.=
 Figure
      out how your deputies can carry more water.=E2=80=9D


*Quick Hits: Bite-sized insights from your peers and special guests*

   - *CEO winners: *Ron Williams called out American Express=E2=80=99 Steve=
 Squeri
   and JP Morgan=E2=80=99s Jamie Dimon as chief executives who have stood o=
ut to him
   for their leadership in recent weeks.
   - *+95%:* This is the percentage of people who don=E2=80=99t make up the=
ir own
   minds when making decisions, according to Eddy. =E2=80=9CThey don't coll=
ect their
   own data. They don't make up their own minds. They follow certain
   cheerleaders and mascots in their life that they pay attention to.=E2=80=
=9D Eddy
   advised leaders to consider these questions: When are you making up your
   own mind? And, at the times you're not, why aren't you?
   - *A group of members huddled to draft a return-to-work framework. Here
   are the steps they recommend:*
      1. *Ask people how they are doing by conducting an employee survey.* =
(How
      are you doing? Are you able to work from home effectively? How
long do you
      think you can continue to work from home?)
      2. *Meet people where they are.* If people need time to get back to
      =E2=80=9Cnormal,=E2=80=9D then give them the space to do so. If their=
 conditions would be
      improved by being back at the office, then consider accordingly
when making
      phased plans.
      3. *Set your priorities. *Who needs to be back? Who can wait? Invite
      people back to work accordingly. Be sensitive to the feedback gathere=
d
      above.
      4. *Phase people in slowly. *Don=E2=80=99t bring all the =E2=80=9Cwav=
es=E2=80=9D of people
      back to work in short order. Let there be spacing between these phase=
s.
      5. *Control access into your space. *Limit where people can park,
      what entrance they can use, ingress and egress, etc.
      6. *Gather data as appropriate to your business *(temperature checks,
      virus testing, antibody testing, etc.). The EEOC issued its guidance
      <https://go.world50.com/e/159871/KJaeDkwIqrw1h7HP6Hg0mX6Wk2bUOI/dmjhj=
8/636985487?h=3Dgp5oLU5MJcYomYuIfXSFjJSTgYCYvmBNEvhRgXhLMTM>during
      the call.
      7. *Provide PPE *as needed and appropriate, both for health and
      safety, and for mental well-being.
      8. *Revisit everything constantly and communicate frequently.*
