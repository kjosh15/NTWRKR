Super.
Invention vs innovation for me is mostly invention =3D research & IP; =
Innovation is making money =E2=80=A6it has to reach the market and meet =
a customer need.
I love your point about an iterative & hacking mindset inherent to =
innovation.

I don=E2=80=99t want environmental considerations to take over=E2=80=A6but=
 I just joined the Advisory board of a CalTech startup that does no/low =
Co2 cement=E2=80=A6which is brilliant. That=E2=80=99s why it was top of =
mind=E2=80=A6 (Brimstone Energy, https://www.brimstoneenergy.com).
The point I wanted to share is that you can choose to spend your time on =
good things which are also commercial.

Best,

Thank-you Josh,
<div class=3D"">Great plan.</div>
<div class=3D"">- Re =E2=80=98good=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98bad innovation we =
can speak about ethics ( =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s not because you can that you=
 should=E2=80=99), environment and quickly touch on privacy (?)</div>
<div class=3D"">- I would add 3 broad areas to the opportunity point: human=
 capital, IT (what people today see as =E2=80=98tech=E2=80=99), engineering=
/ science based tech.</div>
<div class=3D"">- On the last point about systematic innovation, I would hi=
t: multi-functional backgrounds working together, innovation in products, s=
ervices and biz models.</div>
<div class=3D""><br class=3D"">
</div>
<div class=3D"">Perhaps we could end on a positive future vision, and how i=
nnovation makes you think about the way things might work rather than fail =
( which is 80% of the time) ( an optimistic mindset?), and how it=E2=80=99s=
 a key to building the future based on a set of priorities,
 rather than something scary.</div>
<div class=3D""><br class=3D"">
</div>
<div class=3D"">Do we also need to start with a definition? Eg invention vs=
 innovation</div>
<div class=3D""><br class=3D"">
</div>
<div class=3D"">Let me know what you think...</div>
<div class=3D"">Always great to connect, let=E2=80=99s speak soon!</div>
<div class=3D"">Many thanks,</div>

<div dir=3D"ltr" class=3D"">As ever, a great pleasure to speak with you ear=
lier today. I was particularly eye-opened when you reminded me about all th=
e significant viruses of the past few decades and saw how my own bias was s=
hielding me from taking them seriously. The point
 that we're going to be facing potential pandemics ongoing from here can't =
be understated, but perhaps equally as daunting is our own resistance to ac=
cepting this fact. :/

<div class=3D"">In terms of topics, if we're looking to use the role of inn=
ovation (or a &quot;hacking mindset&quot;) as a framework, why don't we tal=
k about:</div>
<div class=3D""><br class=3D"">
</div>
<div class=3D"">- How Innovation has always been a part of business (and ho=
w it's not strictly technical)</div>
<div class=3D"">- Why COVID-19 has suddenly made innovation more visible</d=
iv>
<div class=3D"">- What characterizes&nbsp;&quot;good&quot; (effective) vs &=
quot;bad&quot; (costly and misguided) innovation/hacking</div>
<div class=3D"">- Major risk areas for companies reacting with contraction =
in the face of the crisis</div>
<div class=3D"">
<div class=3D"">- Major opportunity spaces opened up by the virus</div>
<div class=3D"">&nbsp; &nbsp;; I'd want to hit quantification of human beha=
vior here</div>
<div class=3D"">
<div class=3D"">- How innovation as a core function can be systemically&nbs=
p;inculcated company wide</div>
<div class=3D""><br class=3D"">
</div>
<div class=3D"">These are broad buckets - we should narrow these down a bit=
 and then pull out a couple of examples under each which we can prompt each=
 other with. Before that, though, do you think these buckets are right? Wha=
t are we missing / would be interesting specifically
 for this audience?</div>
