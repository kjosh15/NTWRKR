Great thinking; starting my framing iterative vs incremental as parallels
to invention vs innovation, maybe? Don't want to get too lost in the weeds,
but clarifying why we think this hacking mindset is so powerful now could
likely benefit from the explanation.

Similarly on the optimistic vision. My take is that we've learned so much
about innovation in the last twenty years, and that this builds on
discoveries of the last 100+ to put us in an extraordinary position to make
radical, positive change. I.e., converting whole nations to electric
vehicles, UBI, reversals on pharmaceutical development incentives... all
things which were previously considered impossible but which may suddenly
become critical requirements.

As an aside, how do you want to approach the environmental issue? If we're
talking about crisis we were willfully ignoring about it sits at the same
table as pandemics, but I don't want to be overly hyperbolic at the same
time! Thoughts?
