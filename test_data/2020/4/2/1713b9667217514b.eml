Good to hear! Doing well - located ten minutes' walk from Elmurst hospital,
so getting to hear lots of ambulances these days. Very strange times
indeed, especially how "normal" life is outside of it all. Being known as a
thinker about the future means that I'm starting to get more interest from
big companies, which is especially confusing because there's so much
possibility - but every time I look out the window I see nothing except
people in masks.

Anyway, glad you guys are doing well. If I can be of any help please do let
me know, and obviously as I'm able I'll continue to suggest Clay.run as a
solution!

Rain check on that dinner in Queens, my friends. ;)
