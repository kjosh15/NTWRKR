One of the best articulations of the questions in front of us that I've
seen yet:

https://science.slashdot.org/story/20/03/31/2116255/what-happens-after-the-lockdown

I.e., the social distancing we're doing now doesn't solve anything. All it
does is buy us time to craft solutions. But if we don't change our
circumstances (i.e., hospital capacity, treatment modalities, vaccines,
etc.) then whenever we stop the lockdown we go right back to full pandemic.
