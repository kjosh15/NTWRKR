Nice!! Glad to hear you're all safe and sound. We're still in Jackson
Heights, ten minutes from Elmhurst Hospital (the epicenter of the
epicenter). We decided to stay here because Iceland is very under-resourced
(only 42 ventilators in the whole country), although they're doing very
well in flattening the curve, and NYC is able to out-bid anybody else for
resources. Additionally, we made a cell with another family with two kids
and they're all thriving together - the interreliance has been a godsend
and provided a much-needed sense of continuity for all our kids that they
wouldn't get if we shipped off to Iceland. Terrifying trade-offs to juggle!

How's things on the work side? I find it continually confusing that I get
on calls and talk through numbers and negotiate contracts and yet everytime
I look out the window all I see is ambulances. Cognitive dissonance at a
grand scale. You?
