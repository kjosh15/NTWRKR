Good that you're quarantined in your own place, I guess!

So I asked Ben Laurie (about as old school a cryptographer as you're likely
to find) about DIDs and he said: "DON'T GET ME FUCKING STARTED."

Seems like his biggest issue is in "a lifetime encrypted channel," i.e.
keys never get compromised or lost (bear in mind that a "DID" is a private
key, in practice).

Also, that having a private key only proves (assuming no compromise) that I
am the same guy as last time - any other property has to be asserted by a
centralized authority.

Finally, if your key is compromised you have to start again without a house
or bank balance.

Ben knows Drummond from way back, apparently.

You have any counter arguments to all this? And yeah, I'm working to
connect you guys directly because that'd be rad.

As for us, we're still in Queens in the epicenter of the epicenter - mostly
because NYC is way more capable of resourcing than Iceland (they only have
42 ventilators in the country, although they also have functional
government and so have severely flattened the curve...)
