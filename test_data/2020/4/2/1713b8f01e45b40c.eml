Currently in NYC, ten minutes walk from Elmherst Hospital (the epicenter of
the epicenter). We ended up rejecting Iceland because of resourcing - they
have 42 ventilators in the whole country, so while they've done amazingly
well with flattening the curve their ability to handle total load is vastly
inferior. I can tell you it has been quite the daily discussion, however -
stay in the most virally infected part of the USA, or fly to a tiny
island that could easily be toppled in the aftermath?

On the plus side, we've made a cell with another family and the children
are doing exceptionally well with it. So much so that we're already
wondering what we will do "after." After, of course, being a euphemism for
some other state in which we're not locked in our homes.

Would be very curious to get your take on how this will all play out, both
economically and politically. Our decision to stay stateside has added up
in the short term from a medical view (i.e., if one of us gets injured or
sick we think we'll have better chances here), but longer term and from an
economic view who knows how the US is going to manage? That my family all
has Icelandic citizenship (and thus access to Schengen countries) certainly
changes our thinking.

Let me know if you'd like to do a zoom call sometime just to catch up.
Finding a balance has been an ongoing effort - but at the very least I
think we've all learned that talking to folks you trust is a premium
commodity these days.

All best wishes,
Josh
