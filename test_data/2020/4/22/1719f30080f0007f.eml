Joshua,

I watched ~12 minutes (into the 3rd or 4th question) and my gut reaction is n=
egative. Here are some red flags for me:
* They toss around medical techno-speak with no attempt to clarify/explain.
* They say they are fast-tracked by the FDA but have no idea why they are no=
t shown on the FDA=E2=80=99s fast-track list. Come on, that=E2=80=99s malark=
ey - nobody working on a fast-track drug approval doesn=E2=80=99t know where=
 they stand with the FDA.=20
* They say they are in large-scale tests and then speak of 75 patients. That=
 is NOT large scale.=20
* When asked about their double blind tests they say, 1- they don=E2=80=99t h=
ave results and, 2- they cannot share results and they want the results befo=
re they invite in investors. Then they, a- share specific =E2=80=9Cantidotal=
=E2=80=9D results (that they =E2=80=9Ccan=E2=80=99t share=E2=80=9D) and, b- d=
o you know any startup that refuses $s from investors? It sounds like a gian=
t piece of bait to hook investors.=20

Yes, I may be entirely wrong. The number of red flags that I can remember fr=
om watching only 1/4 of the =E2=80=9Cinterview=E2=80=9D leaves me suspect.=20=


Love,
DAD
