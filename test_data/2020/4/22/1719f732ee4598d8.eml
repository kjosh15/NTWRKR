All good points. I got the link from a new source, so was curious what your
take was. It sounds like they=E2=80=99re seeing whT they want to see.

Two new, more well referenced data points, though:

A. I spoke to Eric Johanson via Skype today; hadn=E2=80=99t heard from him =
in
years, but via his work with Bill Gates he had a good view on the vaccine
development and was very bullish that they=E2=80=99ll have at least one vac=
cine
within a year.

B. Another friend of mine is the new advisory board chair for Cambridge=E2=
=80=99s
R&D lab, which (as with all of Cambridge right now) is focused solely on
Covid-19. She sent me this link:

https://3xscreen.videosync.fi/20200417-cambridge-conversations

Their take was that we will continue seeing pandemics like this ongoing, as
we=E2=80=99ve seen a couple per decade for the last twenty years or so (jus=
t not
here.) They also were quite confident that what made Covid-19 deadly was
the cytokine storm caused by the immune system overreacting to the virus,
which is good as it lets us narrow the treatment modalities.

Thought you=E2=80=99d find this info interesting!

Love,
Josh
