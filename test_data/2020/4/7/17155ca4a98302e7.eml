Good talking today; really appreciate your taking the time to walk me
through both where you're at and how the various investments stand given
the crisis.

I took three topics to follow on going forward:

1. IndigoMetrics, the culture metricing platform I described. Let me know
when you have time for me to walk you through the sandbox and we can see if
it would help with your finding a fit for entrepreneurs-in-corporations
(and/or others!)

2. New Lab's 5G Lab. I'm getting more detailed info on this so you don't
have to wade through the brochureware.

3. Board of Advisors for Launchpad (and R&D more broadly?) You'd mentioned
a potential role here; let me know as you learn more.

And of course, I'm intrigued by your scaled sensors platform. Out of all
the efforts you'd mentioned this one (and to a lesser degree the scaled
carbon credit platform) intrigued me most. As you said, it sounds like the
most likely to be a unicorn - and definitely ticks the boxes for large
impact. Please keep me updated as we come out of this crisis and you start
looking at people to help steer it into growth.

All best,
Josh
