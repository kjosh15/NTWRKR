Not sure, I think you need to strip it down to the nutmeat much quicker and
really boost that out - it wasn't entirely clear to me what you're
specifically advocating for.

Also, got some feedback - there's a LOT of nervousness right now among
senior partnership that we can't sell anything in to clients as no one's
liquid. I just don't think this is true, I think there are enough
successful, or well-run, companies that they can make some investments,
particularly to prevent talent from bleeding away.

Anyway, just wanted to flag that for you.
