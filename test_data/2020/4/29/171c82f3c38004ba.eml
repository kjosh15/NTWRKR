Thanks for reaching out Josh. Hope you and yours' are staying safe and
well.  As a farm, we're in good shape. We're catching up to this massive
increase in demand and starting to get ahead of it. We've got plenty of
animals, slaughter dates, and above all, a healthy staff on farm and in the
city. From my understanding, commercial meat will take a major hit. Tyson
plants are closing as their workers are getting sick. Made worse by a
slowness to distribute masks and pretty terrible working conditions. Worth
mentioning that the meat industry successfully lobbied to prevent USDA from
slowing work speeds and reducing line capacity last year. Without
processors, Tyson farmers have no way to send birds to market (I suspect
many will be killed and trashed as they=E2=80=99ll be too expensive to cont=
inue
feeding). Thus there=E2=80=99ll be no new revenue to purchase new chickens.=
 The
overall supply will drop substantially. This is happening in beef and pork
production too. In a lot of ways it=E2=80=99s not the farmers fault, they=
=E2=80=99re either
in debt or barely breaking even with max production.

The farms I work  with are having some trouble keeping up with all their
customers now cooking from home, but overall are doing well. I=E2=80=99ve b=
een
downright humbled by the resilience of small producers in the face of this.

Stay well

Mike
