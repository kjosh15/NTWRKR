Happy to talk anytime - I=E2=80=99m good after 11 today.  Also around =
the ROW!

I think you should be doing anything and everything to get the business =
humming and ideally as close to breakeven or cash positive as possible.  =
Get it ready to speak to VCs and PE. But I don=E2=80=99t think people =
are going to move super quickly.  I know lots of folks with cash sitting =
on the sidelines thinking the good deals around today will still be =
around in 6 months and there=E2=80=99s no need to rush - see how =
everything plays out.  Of course there are exceptions.  But whether =
I=E2=80=99m right or wrong, there=E2=80=99s lots of things that can be =
done today.

Let me know a good time.

By the way - this stuff is fantastic -=20
