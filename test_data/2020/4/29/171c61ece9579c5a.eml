Might be worth warming up some potentail buyer/partner contacts, esp. as we
move forward and start signing up bigger clients more quickly. Grist for
the mill, but I keep finding myself laying in bed at night thinking about
the questions we can ask and experiments we can run once we get to a point
where we don't have to focus on sales as much anymore. Being able to really
optimize and expand the platform feels like where the fun is, and having a
big corporate partner/owner/whatever could go a long way to making that
possible.

Just more musing for the day,
Josh
