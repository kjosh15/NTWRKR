Looooooong time no speak - how's the pandemic treating you?

I saw you swan by on LinkedIn and that you're at Fjord now; I wrote the
tech strategy for IDEO NY Q3/4 last year and am curious how you're liking
it over there. Let me know if you have time for a breif call reg.; would be
good to catch up!

All best wishes for you and yours,
Josh
