"Remote work was already a growing trend among organizations, particularly
in Asia, says Su-Yen Wong. But there are more positive outcomes of remote
workplaces than just allowing your teams to continue working when they
can=E2=80=99t travel physically: The focus on performance and output, as op=
posed to
just input, will also improve diversity, whether it=E2=80=99s better empowe=
ring
working mothers or disabled communities, or expanding the talent pool from
a recruiting perspective."
