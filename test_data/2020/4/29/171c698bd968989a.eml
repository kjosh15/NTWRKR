Hey there. Hope you=E2=80=99re doing well too. The cutting boards have =
now been joined by knife making, mask sewing, some light carpentry, and =
leather work. We may have a Renaissance Fair going on in my driveway =
soon.

I=E2=80=99d be happy to chat about that. I=E2=80=99ve been holding a =
meeting with a bunch of CISOs every few weeks during the pandemic, and =
it=E2=80=99s been interesting to see that most of them are leading the =
COVID response for the company even tho the risks go far beyond cyber. I =
think it=E2=80=99s for a variety of reasons (CISO=E2=80=99s natively are =
risk managers, they have structured incident response plans, they have =
good eyes on employees and their behavior (to your ask)=E2=80=A6) So =
I=E2=80=99ll have some data points I can share for sure.

let me know when you want to chat.

One of the things I'm trying to figure out is if conduct risk is being =
bucketed as a cyber threat given the prevelance of remote working now. =
Do you have a few minutes to quickly discuss in the next week or two?
