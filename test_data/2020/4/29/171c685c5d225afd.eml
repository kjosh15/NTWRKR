Absolutely agree with your timeline - I'm more concerned with how to
prepare and get the right relationships in place so that six months from
now everything is ready to execute and we've built all the right kinds of
proof.

We're breakeven right now, mostly because none of us are drawing a salary
and operating costs are infinitesimal. Adding in ~350k users at
>$1/user/month would change that, along with our outlook.

Today is solid. How does 10am EST tomorrow look?
