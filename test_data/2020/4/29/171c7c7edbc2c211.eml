No, haven't thought much about numbers or practicalities as this just came
up as an idea in a conversation that Alfrun and I had last Saturday. I have
cc. Alfrun as she might have some ideas e.g. how much English people are
willing to pay for online sessions for their kids.

I started looking at this podcast on Sunday called Blingual Kids Rock
https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bilingual-kids-rock and realised that
there are 100 languages with over 7 million speakers (6500 languages but
2000 have only app. 1000 speakers). This means that the idea could be
scaled in the future but Icelandic could be a good testing field.

Here are some initial thoughts as you are sending me some positive vibes:

*Target Groups: *
People who want their children to have access to regular Icelandic sessions
Icelandic families living abroad
Mixed family with 1 Icelandic parent
Interest groups e.g. Canadians with Icelandic roots

*Service offered:*
Group sessions 1 hour a week over Zoom or similar (split into different age
groups)
Private sessions
Subscription to Icelandic curriculum
Service to Government or authorities to distribute curriculum (e.g.
Arnastofnun makes curriculum but nobody has access)
Dialogue with authorities about what kind of curriculum works and is
needed.
Language stimulating games (the founder of https://mussila.com/ might be a
good person to discuss this with)
Curriculum for children immigrating to Iceland
Toolbox for primary and secondary schools to use for immigrants in Iceland
(and possibly older and younger as well)

*Pricing model: *
Access to some free curriculum (e.g. what is paid by Governments)
Monthly subscription models (different rates)
Fee for live sessions

In the development period we would be running this mainly with the teachers
who have been involved in Tungum=C3=A1lat=C3=B6frar but if this works we co=
uld be
looking at having a database of teachers that are available for private
tutoring as well as group sessions.

*Initial tests:*
Contacting all Icelandic Societies around the world
Getting a survey into newsletters through the Embassies
Working with M=C3=B3=C3=B0urm=C3=A1l - an umbrella organisation for all lan=
guage groups
living in Iceland.
(here is an interview with her in the podcast that I mentioned above:
https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bilingual-kids-rock/e/43778437)

Just some initial thoughts. If this works for Icelandic this could work for
all other languages and especially in the non English speaking world as
English is rapidly becoming a second language everywhere.

These are my very initial thoughts on this ;)

I look forward to hearing back.

xahh
