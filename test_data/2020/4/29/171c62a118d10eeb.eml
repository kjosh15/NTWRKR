I've been seeing lots of noise around how PE is going to go on a buying
spree for a bunch of new types of assets as we come out of the pandemic.

My startup is just about to sign one of the three largest construction
firms, one of the big three accounting firms, and one of the world's
biggest jewelers (~320k users between them). Our bet is that once that
happens we'll see a significant uptick in follow-on sales as the big names
provide "proof" to legitimize the service. (We have had ~12 large
multinationals cite that as their reason for passing on using it so far,
despite significant interest.)

What my partner and I really want is someone to manage the sales/support
pipeline so we can focus on feature development and product expansion - all
off the back of a significant sale. We have a good relationship with a
natural fit acquirer, but it's always good to have competitive offers.

Do you have a moment in the next couple weeks to help me look at if it
makes sense to approach PE buyers, and if so what they'd likely want to
see? My sense is that things are going to move very quickly once companies
move from "keeping the wheels on the bus" to "capitalizing on the pandemic
to make investments/changes."

Hope you and yours are well!!
- J
