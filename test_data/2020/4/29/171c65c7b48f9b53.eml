Wanted to also mention that our psychometrics platform for measuring and
managing employee behavior and beliefs is starting to blow up as leaders
realize that employees no longer have clear line-of-sight into how their
behavior is being understood by thier peers. Numbers are up across the
board for adherance, response times, quantity of qualitative data, etc. Let
me know if it'd be useful to revisit with your team!

Hope you and yours are well,
Josh
