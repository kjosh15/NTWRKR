If you get a chance can you pull me updated numbers on retention rates,
quantity of qualitative data, time to response, etc. both pre- and
post-covid? In my pitch to Tiffany yesterday I found that I'm citing these
a lot as examples of "why now" for Indigo, and could use the latest and
greatest.
