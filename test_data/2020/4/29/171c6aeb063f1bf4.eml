I have a friend (also through Ron) who is big in PE in NYC. He offered to
look at our numbers and expected trajectory to see if/what a local firm
would likely be looking for in ~6 months. Given the drawback on the parts
of the VCs we're seeing now (as well as my pet theory about their likely
behavior going forward, see below) I thought it made sense to get a feel
for PE's take.

What sorts of #'s do you feel comfortable sharing with him? He's a friend,
but I haven't worked with him before.

I know you have UK counterparts, although they've traditionally been more
conservative IIR. Do you think the thesis is worth testing there?

- J

P.S. My personal take is that VCs will do what they did in the last couple
crisis - draw way back on core thesis that means certain sectors,
technologies, or services get access to more stringently controlled
funding, and the rest none at all for a while. What do you think?
