I've a number of colleagues who aren't quite as indulgent in their desire
to learn about COVID-19 as I am, and who keep trying to understand what is
so *complicated* about the disease. This article, I thought, did a pretty
good job explaining a lot of it:

https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/we-still-dont-know-how-the-coronavi=
rus-is-killing-us.html

It's a little alarmist (hard to find generalist media that isn't), and I
don't consider myself expert enough to fact check it given the scope, but
my hope was that if you had a similar problem with cross-disciplinary
colleagues it might be of help.

Looking forward to Friday!
