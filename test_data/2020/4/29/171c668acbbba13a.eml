First off, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy!! Where are you
isolating?

Secondly, my startup which quantifies beliefs and behaviors is blowing up
in the face of the remote work onslaught - it turns out that employees
really, really want to have models of how they're percieved by their peers,
especially as that relates to the value of their contributions.

The big question in my and my co-founders' minds, however, is if/when/how
this system could be used to support democracy. We've already seen how
top-down panopticons can work to support/control behavior. Ours is designed
to support and create cohesion in emergant, democratic behavior sets.

Do you have any thoughts on the matter? Would really value your opinion!

All best wishes,
Josh
