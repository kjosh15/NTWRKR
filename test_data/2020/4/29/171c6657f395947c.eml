First, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy. I've been passing on that
link about the cutting boards. Awesome project!!

Separately, the startup I've been working on to quantify behavior and
belief in employees has been getting a lot of traction in the pandemic. One
of the things I'm trying to figure out is if conduct risk is being bucketed
as a cyber threat given the prevelance of remote working now. Do you have a
few minutes to quickly discuss in the next week or two?

All best,
Josh
