>> If there is a silver lining to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that it has i=
njected a sense of togetherness into polarised societies. But the virus, and=
 the economic lockdowns needed to combat it, also shine a glaring light on e=
xisting inequalities =E2=80=94 and even create new ones. Beyond defeating th=
e disease, the great test all countries will soon face is whether current fe=
elings of common purpose will shape society after the crisis. As western lea=
ders learnt in the Great Depression, and after the second world war, to dema=
nd collective sacrifice you must offer a social contract that benefits every=
one.
>>=20
>> Today=E2=80=99s crisis is laying bare how far many rich societies fall sh=
ort of this ideal. Much as the struggle to contain the pandemic has exposed t=
he unpreparedness of health systems, so the brittleness of many countries=E2=
=80=99 economies has been exposed, as governments scramble to stave off mass=
 bankruptcies and cope with mass unemployment. Despite inspirational calls f=
or national mobilisation, we are not really all in this together.
>>=20
>> The economic lockdowns are imposing the greatest cost on those already wo=
rst off. Overnight millions of jobs and livelihoods have been lost in hospit=
ality, leisure and related sectors, while better paid knowledge workers ofte=
n face only the nuisance of working from home. Worse, those in low-wage jobs=
 who can still work are often risking their lives =E2=80=94 as carers and he=
althcare support workers, but also as shelf stackers, delivery drivers and c=
leaners.
>>=20
>> Governments=E2=80=99 extraordinary budget support for the economy, while n=
ecessary, will in some ways make matters worse. Countries that have allowed t=
he emergence of an irregular and precarious labour market are finding it par=
ticularly hard to channel financial help to workers with such insecure emplo=
yment. Meanwhile, vast monetary loosening by central banks will help the ass=
et-rich. Behind it all, underfunded public services are creaking under the b=
urden of applying crisis policies.
>>=20
>> The way we wage war on the virus benefits some at the expense of others. T=
he victims of Covid-19 are overwhelmingly the old. But the biggest victims o=
f the lockdowns are the young and active, who are asked to suspend their edu=
cation and forgo precious income. Sacrifices are inevitable, but every socie=
ty must demonstrate how it will offer restitution to those who bear the heav=
iest burden of national efforts.
>>=20
>> Radical reforms =E2=80=94 reversing the prevailing policy direction of th=
e last four decades =E2=80=94 will need to be put on the table. Governments w=
ill have to accept a more active role in the economy. They must see public s=
ervices as investments rather than liabilities, and look for ways to make la=
bour markets less insecure. Redistribution will again be on the agenda; the p=
rivileges of the elderly and wealthy in question. Policies until recently co=
nsidered eccentric, such as basic income and wealth taxes, will have to be i=
n the mix.
>>=20
>> The taboo-breaking measures governments are taking to sustain businesses a=
nd incomes during the lockdown are rightly compared to the sort of wartime e=
conomy western countries have not experienced for seven decades. The analogy=
 goes still further.
>>=20
>> The leaders who won the war did not wait for victory to plan for what wou=
ld follow. Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill issued the Atlantic Ch=
arter, setting the course for the United Nations, in 1941. The UK published t=
he Beveridge Report, its commitment to a universal welfare state, in 1942. I=
n 1944, the Bretton Woods conference forged the postwar financial architectu=
re. That same kind of foresight is needed today. Beyond the public health wa=
r, true leaders will mobilise now to win the peace.
