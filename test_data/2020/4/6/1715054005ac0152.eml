I imagine you're going 100mph; do you have time for a brief call to
strategize on this podcast interview? Or want to just set up a time to do
it and we can edit it up after? Am keen to get talking - there's SO MUCH
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW that's invisible to the average executive, and which
will be utterly formative (in terms of policy, or employee management, or
tech debt, or or or) for years to come...

All best,
Josh
