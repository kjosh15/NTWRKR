I've been getting a lot of questions around what's appropriate during this=
 time to send out to customers.

I wrote a little bit about it here: https://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blo=

Generally speaking=2C two things are true--and I'll add a third:

1) People are consuming a ton of content now.

2) They have a ton of questions about some really confusing and uncertain=
 times.

3) You have heroes in your network. Share their stories if you have nothin=
g else to talk about.

SVB and T3 Advisors are coming together to answer all your questions about=
 managing real estate in the current climate. We'll cover everything from=
 how to engage with your landlord to how to plan for headcount=2C navigati=

 hope is that the variety of perspectives will give entrepreneurs the answ=
ers they are are seeking during this uncertain time.

This situation is incredibly difficult for everyone=2C but it's especially=
 hard for anyone who lives alone--and I'm not just talking about the elder=
ly widow down the hallway from you. If you came to NYC and had been living=
 the dream of being young and single in a place that had somewhere to be e=
very night--being single during a quarantine can be a really lonely experi=
ence.

Sure=2C you have friends to Zoom with or colleagues that you're on Slack w=
ith all day=2C but what about getting inspired by new and interesting peop=
le?

When I first moved into my apartment=2C we had paint on the wall from the=
 previous owners that I think had been there for most of their 50 years in=
 our space. It was this awful faded yellow color that still had the outlin=
es of their art on the walls.

I ordered paint off of Clare.com and it came with everything we needed to=
 brighten the space up. Color selection with their big swatches was easy--=
and boy am I glad I did it now. Like you=2C we're obviously spending a lot=
 of time staring at the inside of our apartment.

If you want to spruce up your quarantine bunker=2C use the code BETTERTOGE=
THER for $10 off four gallons or more--but the offer expires end of day to=
morrow.

Sure=2C it's a portfolio company--but it's not an ad. It's a suggestion. E=
very time I look at our walls I keep thinking about how awful that yellow=
 was and how happy it makes me not to see it anymore.

You've got the time to paint--and isn't it about time your kids ramped up=
 their chores? Get those Zoom toddlers some rollers!

th officials keep us informed. We can use this information to best survive=
 the crisis. Join us for a very timely discussion on public health in the=
 new era of COVID19.  Hear perspectives and ask questions in a virtual pan=
