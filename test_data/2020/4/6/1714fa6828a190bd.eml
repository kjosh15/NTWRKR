            <p>Generally speaking, two things are true--and I'll add a third=
:</p>
            <p>1) People are consuming a ton of content now.</p>
            <p>2) They have a ton of questions about some really confusing a=
nd uncertain times.</p>
            <p>3) You have heroes in your network. Share their stories if yo=

          <p>This situation is incredibly difficult for everyone, but it's e=
specially hard for anyone who lives alone--and I'm not just talking about th=
e elderly widow down the hallway from you. If you came to NYC and had been l=
iving the dream of being young and single in a place that had somewhere to b=
e every night--being single during a quarantine can be a really lonely exper=
ience.</p>
          <p>Sure, you have friends to Zoom with or colleagues that you're o=
n Slack with all day, but what about getting inspired by new and interesting=
 people?</p>

          <p>When I first moved into my apartment, we had paint on the wall f=
rom the previous owners that I think had been there for most of their 50 yea=
rs in our space. It was this awful faded yellow color that still had the out=
lines of their art on the walls.</p>
          <p>I ordered paint off of <a href=3D"https://thisisgoingtobebig.us=
1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D4c2ee8c906b6f9bdf2b29d2b8&amp;id=3Db8b09bd=
bdb&amp;e=3D6fbf0a30be" target=3D"_blank">Clare.com</a>&nbsp;and it came wit=
h everything we needed to brighten the space up. Color selection with their b=
ig swatches was easy--and boy am I glad I did it now. Like you, we're obviou=
sly spending a lot of time staring at the inside of our apartment.</p>
          <p>If you want to spruce up your quarantine bunker, use the code B=

 day tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Sure, it's a portfolio company--but it's not an ad. It's a sugg=
estion. Every time I look at our walls I keep thinking about how awful that y=
ellow was and how happy it makes me not to see it anymore.</p>

 ramped up their chores? Get those Zoom toddlers some rollers!</p>
