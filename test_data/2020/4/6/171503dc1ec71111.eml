This site was recommended:

http://covid19.healthdata.org/

Of particular note is that we are just about to hit peak in NYC, in which
it is estimated that we will need 24,786 beds (we have 13,010), 6,636 ICU's
(we have 718), and 5,641 ventilators. The good news is that demand slopes
sharply downwards after that, and by April 27th should have enough beds and
ICUs to meet demand again.

So wash your hands! And maybe don't listen to the news as much... ;)
