Thanks!! Let me know how I can help with this; really appreciate it.

Things here are good; kids are loving homeschooling, the weather is getting
really nice, and we're just savoring the time together without the
onslaught of "stuff" we usually would be doing. Lots of home projects
getting done over here.

That said, there's an overarching sense of concern as NYC is due to hit its
peak this week, with the medical system truly getting destroyed. By the end
of the week we will need 24,786 beds (we have 13,010) and 6,636 ICU's (we
have 718)... So it will be ugly.

How about yourselves? All well and healthy? And what's your take on
Iceland? I'm curious why you've stayed where you are vs. heading back
there.

All best,
Josh
