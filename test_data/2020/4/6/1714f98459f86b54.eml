We'll be sending out a big batch of acceptances today, but there looks to

I've been getting a lot of questions around what's appropriate during this
time to send out to customers.

I wrote a little bit about it here:

Generally speaking, two things are true--and I'll add a third:

1) People are consuming a ton of content now.

2) They have a ton of questions about some really confusing and uncertain
times.

3) You have heroes in your network. Share their stories if you have nothing
else to talk about.

SVB and T3 Advisors are coming together to answer all your questions about
managing real estate in the current climate. We'll cover everything from
how to engage with your landlord to how to plan for headcount, navigating
legalities, best practices and more. Nothing is off limits, and our hope is
that the variety of perspectives will give entrepreneurs the answers they
are are seeking during this uncertain time.

This situation is incredibly difficult for everyone, but it's especially
hard for anyone who lives alone--and I'm not just talking about the elderly
widow down the hallway from you. If you came to NYC and had been living the
dream of being young and single in a place that had somewhere to be every
night--being single during a quarantine can be a really lonely experience.

Sure, you have friends to Zoom with or colleagues that you're on Slack with
all day, but what about getting inspired by new and interesting people?

When I first moved into my apartment, we had paint on the wall from the
previous owners that I think had been there for most of their 50 years in
our space. It was this awful faded yellow color that still had the outlines
of their art on the walls.

I ordered paint off of Clare.com
<https://thisisgoingtobebig.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D4c2ee8c906b=
6f9bdf2b29d2b8&id=3Db8b09bdbdb&e=3D6fbf0a30be>
and
it came with everything we needed to brighten the space up. Color selection
with their big swatches was easy--and boy am I glad I did it now. Like you,
we're obviously spending a lot of time staring at the inside of our
apartment.

If you want to spruce up your quarantine bunker, use the code
BETTERTOGETHER for $10 off four gallons or more--but the offer expires end
of day tomorrow.

Sure, it's a portfolio company--but it's not an ad. It's a suggestion.
Every time I look at our walls I keep thinking about how awful that yellow
was and how happy it makes me not to see it anymore.

You've got the time to paint--and isn't it about time your kids ramped up
their chores? Get those Zoom toddlers some rollers!
