I have no counter arguments. I share those concerns as well and also am
incredibly skeptical A A) most companies would be incentivized to use DIDs,
since either selling or controlling aspects of identity is good for
business and B) how they think the majority of non-technical users  are
expected to handle things like account recovery, which will most likely
require having a backup credential authenticator and I don't think most
people would buy. Not surprised Ben knows Drummond, this dude has been on
the identity and security scene for EVER. I think he has attended just
about every IIW...

Will let you know about Vermont and can ask my aunt if she knows anyone,
sounds like a lot of old folks had similar ideas and the folks who usually
go away in the summer are sticking around.
Stay safe this week is gonna blow.
