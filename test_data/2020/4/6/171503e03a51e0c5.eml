Fair enough. I pushed my friend on these and he basically agreed.
Businesses still seem to like it, though... ;P

Your point about Drummond seems spot on, BTW. I've never met him AFAIK but
man, reputation is a real thing.

Similarly, let me know if you hear anything further about hiring at Google.
I'm keen to start absorbing something other than epidemiology!!

All best,
Josh
