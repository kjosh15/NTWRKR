Hey Josh -

Thanks. I'll get back to you on the suggested terms tomorrow.

In the meantime, our values are:

Take care of each other
Speak Up (no silent disagreement)
Collaborate inside and out
Produce amazing work

I've been trying to figure out how to get something in there about
diversity (both in the Diversity & Inclusion sense but also diversity of
experience, POV, etc) AND adaptivity.

We also have everyone who interviews read our manual
<https://bigspaceship.com/public/manual.pdf>, which has a lot of the
underpinnings of the values and culture.

Let me know if you need any further info.

M
