Weena,

I just spent several hours figuring out what a small business owner can
apply for. Here's the current options AFAIK:

# 1. Small business continuity loan (NYC)

https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/article/nyc-small-business-continuity-loan=
-program

0% interest for one year, up to $75k
This is first-come-first-serve, so if you don't apply now you won't get it
This is via New York City
zero-interest loan of up to $75,000 to businesses with fewer than 100
employees whose sales have decreased by 25% or more due to COVID-19. This
includes sole proprietorships

# 2. Economic Injury Disaster Loans and Loan Advance (EIDL) (Federal)

https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/

Up to $10,000 doesn't have to be repaid
easy to apply

# 3. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) (Federal)

https://sbsconnect.nyc.gov/covid/eligibility/

self-employed can apply starting April 10th
complete the Paycheck Protection Program loan application and submit the
application with the required documentation to an approved lender
Loans can be for up to two months of your average monthly payroll costs
from the last year plus an additional 25% of that amount.
should have the loan forgiven at the end if you use it just for payroll

Hope this helps!!

best,
Josh
