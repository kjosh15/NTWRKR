We need to check in with John to make sure that check is coming in June.
Given how slow employment is going it looks like we're going to need it.
Finger's crossed I'm wrong, but unless I close on something this month we
wouldn't get a paycheck until then anyway!

Can you take this on?

xoxo,
Josh
