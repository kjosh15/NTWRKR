Here we=E2=80=99re really looking at two types of programme =E2=80=93 =
high impact, noisy titles (whether a premium box set or talent led) or a =
visible commitment in terms of developing new talent (whether in front =

New Directors and so it is rare to take up bespoke commissions outside =

and so are looking at ideas further out.
