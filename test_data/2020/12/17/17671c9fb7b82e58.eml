Can sign into Apple Arcade to do this (which means we have to get out again
before they start monthly charges) or pay $14 to get it on steam. Happy to
do this if want a game for H to play, but... he's not asking yet, and I'm
inclined to let him follow the Prodigy/Epic route first. Thoughts?

xoxo,
Josh
