AMAZING!!! Genius work, Chris - very very well done! I'd recall that only a
week or two ago you were talking about being very concerned for the
contract; you've done amazingly in navigating this one.

Just out of curiosity, if I rollout to the full 33,000 what would our total
numbers look like?

All best,
Josh
