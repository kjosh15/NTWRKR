Hi Josh,

Afraid we don=E2=80=99t have good news from BBC3. But let=E2=80=99s =
submit to the larger BBC system to see what happens.

Below is what I got back. They are shooting for a much younger demo than =
before. 16 year olds is an age bracket that I=E2=80=99m frankly not even =
sure how to create for. This project seems way over their heads. But =
maybe not for another BBC channel...

Thanks for sending this over and thinking of Three. This feels like it =
could work very well in YouTube, with viewers debating in the comments. =
However, it doesn=E2=80=99t fit in with our current iPlayer strategy. =
Here we=E2=80=99re really looking at two types of programme =E2=80=93 =
high impact, noisy titles (whether a premium box set or talent led) or a =
visible commitment in terms of developing new talent (whether in front =
of or behind the camera) in smaller pieces that will have real resonance =
with 16-24s. On the latter, we have some schemes in place such as for =
New Directors and so it is rare to take up bespoke commissions outside =
of that. Furthermore, we are largely commissioned up for the next year =
and so are looking at ideas further out.
=20
However, do feel free to send this in to the BBC Pitch system, and you =
could get another view from one of the factual commissioners.

Onwards,
Matt
