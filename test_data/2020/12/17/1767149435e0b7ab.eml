In filling in the initial form I listed my LLC as having two employees as
it seemed to indicate it needed to know how many people benefitted (in this
case my wife and I). However, I am a sole proprietor and do not contract
anyone, so I believe I need to change this to zero. I'm ready to submit my
Schedule C in any case; please advise on a) if I should change this, and if
so b) how.

If I'm reading your materials correctly I need to have this all submitted
within the next two weeks - thanks for your help!

All best wishes,
Josh
