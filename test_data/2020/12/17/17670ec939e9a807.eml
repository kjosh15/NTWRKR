So some twists on the gifts saga; it turns out that there are almost no
english books left at the bookstore (and the ones they have the boys
already know via school.) They're getting a ton of Icelandic books
because of the book flood.

However, we can think of two solutions. 1) You order some books via Amazon
and the kids are stoked when they arrive in the lull after XMas. Or 2) You
order a Kindle gift card. We've been leaving heavily on the Kindle for
english books in the last couple months and they're always keen to buy new
ones.

Let me know what you think! Otherwise we got them a fabulous gift from you
guys - a classic marble maze

Xoxo,
