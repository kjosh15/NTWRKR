            <p>Glad you liked it, and, if you have time, it'd be great
              to touch base again before the holidays.</p>
            <p>How are you this coming Friday, the 18th? Say noon, 1pm,
              or 2pm? Some other time? <br>
            </p>
            <p>I'd like to add this quote from the FT which succinctly
              describes the opportunity we stand before:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=monerium"
                target="_blank" moz-do-not-send="true">https://www.ft.com/search?q=monerium</a>:
              <br>
              <br>
              "Monerium ... can create e-money (effectively digitised
              fiat currency) which can also be traded cross-border
              without a financial intermediary. It could potentially
              create an explosion in the use of e-money across the
              continent. Much like other cryptocurrency technologies, it
              could also change the balance of power in the financial
              sector making traditional banks less important." </p>
            <p>Near term, we are looking for capital with connections
              and experience which helps us launch and scale, and people
              who can help us execute. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Our stretch goal is the SP500 by 2040, or sooner. <br>
            </p>

                    <p>Great talking to you likewise!</p>
                    <p>I am about to send an invite to a Google Drive
                      folder with summary and deck, for your eyes only
                      please. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>It'd be great to talk again when you've had time
                      to digest. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Incidentally, I looked up David Friedman,
                      according  Wikipedia he is Patri's father, and
                      David's website has an article about Iceland's
                      constitution in the commonwealth era. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Modern Iceland has evolved since libertarian days
                      of the Viking settlers, but at Monerium we are
                      effectively building a "narrow bank" for
                      blockchains inspired by the ideas of several
                      well-known economists, including Milton Friedman.
                      <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>And this is by using an established framework for
                      financial services in major jurisdiction, e-money
                      in the EU. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Which could help displace the current
                      To-Big-To-Fail banks and make the financial system
                      more efficient and less risky. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>As you also mentioned, small and medium sized
                      banks should be in favor of a more decentralized
                      approach to finance. </p>
