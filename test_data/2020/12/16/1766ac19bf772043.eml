Been thinking about how to really crystalize the value behind Indigo,
visually, and want to put a three part visual together following an
explanation that companies currently navigate with engagement software
alone, which only tells them, at best, WHO is engaged.

1) When employees are engaged (visual of Longitudinal Graph)
2) Where employees are aligned (visual of Spider Graph)
3) Which specific behaviors (visual of Score Detail)

The idea being to highlight that unlike current offerings we have a
comprehensive view of how to manage corporate culture and are building a
suite of tools to use this data to do so autonomously and at scale.

Let me know if this reflects your thinking - again, I'm trying to get very
core here. There's a ton of detail to add (such as the subset values for
D&I, Innovation, etc. migration) but the deck needs to nail the
across-your-face value.
