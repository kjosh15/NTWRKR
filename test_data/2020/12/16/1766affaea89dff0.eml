Stephanie,

I'm filing for PPP forgiveness and they are requesting my 2019 IRS Form
1040 Schedule C (or F).

I filled in Kabbage (my lender)'s form saying that I have two employees (or
am self-employed) meaning my wife and I and that we used 100% of the
$18,056.00 PPP loan within 24 weeks of receiving it on 5/12/2020.

I can just submit my 1040 Schedule C, or I can go back and try to get them
to list us as having 0 employees first. Can you advise?

Thanks!
Josh
