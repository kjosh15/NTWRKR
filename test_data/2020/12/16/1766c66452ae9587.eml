Hey Khatdija!

Best of luck in wrapping up 2020! Looking forward to seeing what 2021 can
hold.

How about 9am EST Jan 18, 20, or 22nd, or 10am or 11am EST on the 19th or
21st? Alternately, my overall calendar is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>
if that's helpful. Excited to reconnect.

All best,
Josh
