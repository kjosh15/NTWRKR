Happy holidays!! Very exciting news about vaccines coming to Iceland. I'll
be curious to see how the rollout goes.

Separately, let me know if your revisor has an interest in a brief call. I
think I'll need to employ a separate service to do my US filing, but will
need assistance in filing within Iceland going forward in any case and
could use a trusted recommendation.

I hope you and your family are all well,
Josh
