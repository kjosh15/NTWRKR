Hi Josh,

I hope your week is going well! Deepest apologies on our end for the
delayed response. The end of the year has been quite hectic for World 50 --
as I am sure it is everywhere this year!

Thank you so much for coming to Dr. Ming's call. She is incredible and
you're absolutely right, listening to her work and the impact it has was
extraordinary. We're thinking of having Dr. Ming come back sometime next
year for a second call to share more of her findings -- we'll certainly
keep you posted for that one as well.

I don't think schedules will allow us to find time before the new year but
we'd love to set time up to share some of our upcoming 2021 plans in
January. Would you have availability the week of January 18? We can be
flexible to your schedule.

Looking forward to getting something in the books!

Best,
Khatdija
