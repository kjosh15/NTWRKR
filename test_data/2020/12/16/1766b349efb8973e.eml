Holly,

We're building some functional updates on the platform that allow subset
values to be measured and integrated - i.e., we can do an evaluation of
your D&I behaviors based on the results from your existing values, and
potentially migrate more D&I-positive action statements over time to change
employee perception of what success is. For WhatIf, it means you can pull
data on a much wider variety of potential areas needing change, as well as
measure impact on a much broader spread of results.

Let me know where your team is at on the analytics effort and if it's worth
a call to discuss.

All best,
Josh
