Sent this out a while ago. Am finding the feedback loops on this process
pretty rocky, but useful as hell. The fear of messing up around the
contacts we're able to talk to is massive; somehow I didn't realize that
people of this calibre would be taking my calls and saying "send me your
deck" within the first 30 seconds. All good stuff!

All best,
Josh
