Sorry, PayPal seized some of our assets so we don't use them anymore. You
can also just transfer to my US bank account if that's easier.

As for Amazon, it's the same problem - when I enter in your address it
tells me "The state and ZIP Code you provided do not match."

I believe Mom is calling today to talk XMas stuff; looking forward to it!

xoxo,
Josh
