    <p>I&#39;d like to add this quote from the FT which succinctly describe=

      the opportunity we stand before:</p>
    <p><a href=3D"https://www.ft.com/search?q=3Dmonerium" target=3D"_blank"=

      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Monerium ... can create e-money (effectively digitised fiat
      currency) which can also be traded cross-border without a
      financial intermediary. It could potentially create an explosion
      in the use of e-money across the continent. Much like other
      cryptocurrency technologies, it could also change the balance of
      power in the financial sector making traditional banks less
      important.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>Near term, we are looking for capital with connections and
      experience which helps us launch and scale, and people who can
      help us execute. <br>

    <p>Our stretch goal is the SP500 by 2040, or sooner. <br>

                                              <p>Josh, good to meet you,
                                                welcome to the Warm
                                                Island of the North.</p>
                                              <p>A well known Silicon
                                                Valley entrepreneur,
                                                Balaji Srinivasan,
                                                recently claimed that
                                                fiat currency is a scam.
                                                <br>

                                              secret mission is to fix
                                              fiat - or at least improve
                                              it significantly - by
                                              using blockchains to
                                              remove intermediaries in
                                              mainstream commercial
                                              transactions. <br>
                                              <p>Towards that end, we
                                                became the first company
                                                authorized to issue
                                                e-money on blockchains.

                                              <p>Which is a Big Deal
                                                because the EU just
                                                announced a proposal for
                                                Markets in Crypto Assets
                                                which stipulates that
                                                all &quot;stablecoins&quot;=
 in
                                                Europe should be

                                                and behind the scenes
                                                for ways to &quot;flatten
