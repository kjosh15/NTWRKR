Awesome, thanks! Sounds inline with what we've heard so far.

Also, spoke to this guy yesterday - he wants to see my materials and
consider recommending us to the CEO of Accenture or one of a few other
funds he manages/advises. Reminded me that where we really differentiate is
in access: i.e., if we can tell a really good story, we can potentially
find the right investors/buyers.

Let me know if/when you want to reconnect, and thanks!
- J
