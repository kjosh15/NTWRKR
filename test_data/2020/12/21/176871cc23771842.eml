Good catching up today - it=E2=80=99s been a while!! Glad to hear you two a=
re doing
well, and congrats on the awesome projects you=E2=80=99ve been working on. =
I=E2=80=99m
going to have think more about the CGM idea...

Below is that latest thread on power. I=E2=80=99d thought it was the thread=
 on
battery use, but turns out he replied (to the group) with his solar setup.
If you can rescue this by suggesting an alternative solar setup and asking
if anyone has feedback that would be a godsend - my apologies if I screwed
this up. :/

Finally, hit me up at josh.is/scheduling to set a time to reconnect in
January. I=E2=80=99d still like to find a way to engage with the ravens her=
e, and
am curious to compare notes on how to move the crowbox community forward.

Happy holidays,
Josh

now offhand of a good cable (that is, a nice long cable) that can carry 5VD=

ause we never explored it so we don&#39;t have a good idea of cost, and we =
don&#39;t have data on voltage loss (to wire resistance) across that distan=

>2) Portable power. The demand for this seems huge and we did limited preli=
minary testing quite some time ago, but with some discouraging results. We =
tested five banks and only the VOLTAIC brand properly worked on low-current=
 devices without shutting itself off. The nominal use-case these devices ar=
e designed for means that 95% of them have auto-shutoff functions which are=
 largely unlabeled. That said, while Voltaic power banks are a little expen=
sive they&#39;re less expensive than most in-line GFCI switches for extensi=
on cords and so could be a good tradeoff for many people. Is anyone out the=

which ones DON&#39;T have the auto-shut-off feature so we can point people =
at good alternatives?<br><br>Much obliged,<br>Josh<br><br>P.S. In case you&=
#39;re skimming the above DON&#39;T JUST BUY a cheap 30,000mAh power bank f=
rom Amazon and expect it to work! The only vendor we found that produced a =
workable power bank that didn&#39;t auto-shutoff was Voltaic, and that was =
some time ago. Updated research is needed.<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-p=
