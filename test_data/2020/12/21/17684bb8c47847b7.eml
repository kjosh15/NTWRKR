NP and happy holidays!

Big news is we found a way to track subset data for D&I. I.e., rather than
track an entirely new set of D&I values, we're able to map action
statements used to define existing values to a subset of D&I values. This
allows two things:

1) After a couple months we can magically produce a broadly mapped view of
where D&I problems / priorities exist. (Or Innovation, or Customer
Engagement, or whatever else).

2) If the client approves, we can start migrating more D&I oriented action
statements into existing value sets. I.e., if they have Collaboration as a
value, we can start asking about collaboration with people who are
dissimilar in order to help promote a shift in frame.

We're talking to the executive director of Wharton's People Analytics
division and I hope to get them to test the efficacy in producing behavior
change, but based on what we're seen so far this reframing of desired
behaviors is as autonomous and distributed a solution as you could ask for.
(I.e., probably not as impactful as workshops or interventions, but
certainly more helpful than watching a video.)

I owe you a great thanks for all this, BTW: you're the one who pointed out
that embedding D&I into a larger curriculum was far more successful than
confronting people about a specific problem!

Additionally, World 50's D&I group is going to hit 500 companies in Q2 '21,
and we're talking about using the platform so everyone can compare
measures. My pitch there is that we cannot compare specific scores, but we
can measure impact (in terms of % of change over time) so that everyone can
share best practices and advance the world of work as a whole.

The big problem here is defining the action statements that 500 different
companies across every industry can all agree best define good D&I
behaviors. Have any ideas?

Finally, what's news with you?!? Vaccines are on their way, you have a new
president, and the future is wildly uncertain. How's it going?
