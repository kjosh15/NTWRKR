v><br></div><div>I played the drumming on my phone instead of with headphone=
s - next time will definitely use headphones as I think it=E2=80=99ll be mor=
e effective. Had several false starts thinking that the music was too fast, I=
 was too hot, wasn=E2=80=99t feeling anything, etc. and each time dropped de=
eper into it as soon as I let go of the concern.</div><div><br></div><div>Fi=
rst I tried going into a hole in the yard, but it had a hose and some mechan=
ical pieces in and felt scary. Then tried going into a hole by one of the bi=
rch trees further down the hill here, but again it felt scary. Kept trying t=
o find a hole I felt welcome in and realized I was just scared, so on impuls=
e asked my spirit animal for help.</div><div><br></div><div>They suddenly ap=
peared underneath me as though I were a tiny infant and ran directly into a h=
ole that opened up in the earth. It was cold, dark, fecund, and narrow, but I=
 clung to their back and we raced through it, around twists and turns, somet=
imes even upside down, often into dead ends or forks. I began to fear we wou=
ldn=E2=80=99t get anywhere and realized that was part the block so let go, a=
nd then we began to go faster until we were loping down a wide tunnel and th=
en were suddenly running through a wide leafless birch forest over thick cru=
sted snow.</div><div><br></div><div>We ran for a while until we came to an o=
pen space and I realized it was full of my spirit animal in all kinds of col=
ors, hundreds of them all playing and nosing around. They all jumped and toy=
ed at us and encouraged us to go further, through a dark break in the wood t=
o something ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>But I insisted my purpose was on=
ly to have come out of the tunnel and that I should go back. They acknowledg=
ed me and rushed against me, rubbing their coats against my chest and slidin=
g through my skin (??), marking me with their scent/light.&nbsp;</div><div><=
br></div><div>Then several of them took my fingertips in their jaws and held=
 them, also holding my eyes to remind me that our teeth are sharp and our ey=
es are keen. I felt a rush of energy then, and we turned to go back and the t=
unnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ran loping back in animal shape, but als=
o as big as myself, and it was as easy as climbing a ladder, and I came up b=
y my foot where I lay on the kitchen floor and snuggled into my body and wai=
ted, very alert, for the drumming to end.</div><div><br></div><div>Journey 2=
 - December 21, 2020</div><div><br></div><div>Used AirPods, more comfy under=
 a comforter. Maybe too comfy! Couldn=E2=80=99t get clarity of mind, almost n=
odded off, and no success at all in entering a tunnel. Was afraid, and each t=
ime I found one I bobbed out of it like a cork. Eventually gave up and let m=
yself not worry about it, which is when I started to nod off. Tried not to b=
e bummed about it but am curious what it meant, am sure there is something t=
o learn here and suspect it has to do with doing this =E2=80=9Cthe right way=
.=E2=80=9D Just wanted to play with my spirit animal but didn=E2=80=99t want=
 to call on them to travel.&nbsp;</div></body></html>=
