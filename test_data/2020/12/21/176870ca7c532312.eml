This is such a wild time with the light and the dark advancing and =
retreating. It always fascinates me. The sun will come up later until =
Jan 7th, but the sun is now setting twice as late than the rising, so =
the days get longer.=20
Winter: the return of the light. it always feels good and solid for me =
as opposed to a wee bit depressive at the beginning of summer going that =
I=E2=80=99m loosing the light.=20
I=E2=80=99m not sure we=E2=80=99re, I=E2=80=99m, out of the dark yet.=20
Somebody added a 6th phase to the grief process and that is making =
meaning. I=E2=80=99m thinking I=E2=80=99m still a little early in the =
grieving of what was and what could have been to make meaning of it yet. =
And simultaneously, I=E2=80=99 actually more joyful than I ever would =
have imagined to just be in place with few obligations to others and =
wide open schedule space to unfold as I need to. I=E2=80=99m looking =
forward to these next weeks and we=E2=80=99ll see if I can manage to not =
fill it up. The pandemic and winter are helping.=20

I=E2=80=99m excited( and honored) to hear your journey.=20
I=E2=80=99ve got my interview with CIIS tomorrow night.=20

Thinking of you and looking forward to connecting,
Warmly,
Barri
