Excellent - just sent an invite for tomorrow at 9am PST. Thank you for
making the time!

Here <https://www.thedrifterleather.com/> are the boots: note the
prominent "Fully Booked" headline...

No need for feedback on language just yet; my biggest problem is in
encapsulating the core value of the platform in a concise linguistic
payload. The login I sent you was for the platform itself (a sandboxed
version) as that's the best way I've found of describing what it does, but
will gladly walk you through it tomorrow.

In terms of s's I was taught in journalism class in college that if a word
ends with S the apostrophe stands for "s's." Wikipedia is unclear on the
matter, so I here defer to my own taste (as in most things).

Looking forward to it,
Josh
