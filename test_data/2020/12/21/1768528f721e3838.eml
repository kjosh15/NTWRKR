David,

Happy holidays! I wanted to get something on the calendar shortly after the
holidays to talk about new capabilities on the platform, make sure we're
aligned in supporting Bechtel's new efforts, and dig into the D&I work a
little. Let me know when you might have some time, and I hope you and your
family have a restful holiday!

All best wishes,
Josh
