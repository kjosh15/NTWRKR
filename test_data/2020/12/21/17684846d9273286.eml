Hmmm.... that's a great idea! I have a TON of peels left as the recipe
produced about two liters but the mince pies only need a couple
tablespoons. Let me know how yours get on!

BTW, earlier this year you gave me some excellent advice - "Things
generally turn out worse than you'd hoped and better than you'd feared." It
has stood me in very good stead and I've shared it with a bunch of people
who have professed that it was hugely helpful to them as well. Thanks!

xoxo,
Josh
