You beat me to it - happy holidays to you and yours as well!!

We just yesterday made mincemeat pies, something I've been talking about
doing since the boys were born. Perhaps we can add Kifeletti to the list!

Thanks for all your insight, humor, and friendship in 2020. You made a big
difference in what could have been a dark and traumatic time. Here's
looking to more mutual successes in 2021!!

All best wishes,
Josh

P.S. I'm mulling over a new idea. Do you think it's crazy for me to aim for
a women-only personal advisory board? Was thinking it might be appealing to
some high-level folks simply as an exercise, and potentially a very
interesting proof of concept!
