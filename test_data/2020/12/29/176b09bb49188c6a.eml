First, happy new year! Second, let me know if you=E2=80=99re game for a catc=
h up call. Third, I=E2=80=99d be curious what you make of this article:

https://news.stanford.edu/2020/12/21/new-blood-test-device-monitors-blood-ch=
emistry-continually/

My biggest questions are around how far it is from being implantable - from w=
hat I can see this is definitely an external device - but the implications i=
f it could be miniaturized and internally powered (I recently learned that a=
 good friend had done work on blood turbines) are huge!

All best wishes,
Josh
