ekend or early next week.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So,=
 Voltaic has revamped their entire product line since I tested their power =
bank. They still proudly advertise their &quot;Always On&quot; power banks,=
 so that&#39;s good for us. They understand they have customers with Time-L=
apse Photography, IoT, and other low-energy projects like ours.</div><div><=
br></div><div>They have a good deal on this solar get-up:</div><div><br></d=

or 60 bones you get a 2 watt solar panel and a 6,400mAh power bank. It stil=
l takes one more part (a USB breakout cable) to easily connect this to a Cr=
owbox. But, for under $70 you get an always on power bank with decent capac=
ity and a 2W solar panel designed to work with that power bank, along with =
the other cable needed to attach it to a Crowbox. I don&#39;t know if this =
comes out to be less money than the piecemeal solar setup posted by that on=
e user but it&#39;s sure as fuck easier.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Eve=
n if the solar panel only practically nets 1 watt, or even 1/2 watt, it sho=
uld still power a Crowbox indefinitely. 6,400 mAh would run a Crowbox for f=
ive days with NO solar panel, so the bank should be up to the task of keepi=
ng a box running during poor solar output.</div><div><br></div><div>The Cro=
wbox uses 47mA, or .245 watts.</div><div><br></div><div>So even if the sola=
r panel only delivered 1/2 watt of power, it&#39;s still double what the Cr=
owbox is consuming.</div><div><br></div><div>I ordered one of these kits so=
 I could give it a go. Our days are short and cold, nights long and colder,=
 but the days tend to be fairly sunny but cloudy a=C2=A0few times a week. S=
o these are pretty realistic as a set of adverse conditions so I think I&#3=
9;ll do some testing on this configuration purely to determine whether a Cr=
owbox can be kept running constantly this way.</div><div><br></div><div>In =
other news, I&#39;ve decided to make videos demonstrating the process of co=
nnecting either a USB power bank or a 12V power source to a Crowbox. There&=
#39;s so much interest in this topic that it just makes good sense to docum=
ent it for people, and a video will be much more effective than text. I ord=
ered a couple of parts that I need for this so maybe I can shoot these next=
 week.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div></div>
