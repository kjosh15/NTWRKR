Do we have a good intro to their venture arm? Just spoke to someone at
Clear-sky.com and he can intro us.

Otherwise he pointed out that while he originally thought we were too early
for a strategic it sounds like it could be a good fit if we really like the
term sheet. He also pointed out that you don't have to include a right of
first refusal - you just have to be willing to walk.

All best,
Josh
