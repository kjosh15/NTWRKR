1) happy new year!! 2020 had many hard surprises; here=E2=80=99s hoping 202=
1 helps
us reap the rewards of surviving them.

2) do you have any book recommendations on shamanism? I was thinking I
might like to build more context for my own travels.

3) did you want to use our different language cipher? Or postpone until
we=E2=80=99re f2f or doing a Skype assisted journey?

Sending all best wishes to you and yours!
- J
