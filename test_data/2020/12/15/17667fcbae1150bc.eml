Dear Friends and Family,

 The days are getting shorter as we near the winter solstice. The sun sets
around 4:00, right around the time I=E2=80=99m biking home from my swim.  W=
e are
back at level 3 which has been wonderful after six weeks at level 5.  I can
now go to the gym again and we are able to enjoy meals out.  Eric even
managed to get a haircut, his second since March.  On Friday, the
restrictions will loosen further and we will be able to travel around the
Country, right now we are restricted to County Dublin.  We have planned a
trip to the town of Sneem in Kerry for Eric=E2=80=99s Birthday and are real=
ly
looking forward to seeing new sights and staying in a hotel!



Virtual Celebrations

The traditional office parties have gone virtual this year and we have
attended 2 such celebrations so far put on by Microsoft.  The first one was
on Thanksgiving or as it is known in Ireland, Thursday.  They had a local
band from Wexford play a virtual show from their house.  The band was
called Ma=C4=8Ba and are three sisters that played a mix of traditional Iri=
sh
Music and original songs.  It was wonderful listening to great music as we
prepared the pumpkin pies.  Here is a bit of their music:

The second event was a Great Gatsby themed affair.  I know there are many
of you who will disagree but I did not care for the Great Gatsby one bit as
I found none of the characters relatable, however, we had a blast dressing
up in our roaring twenties outfits!  The event was bizarre as it was not at
all interactive.  It began with a monologue by a fairly offensive American
followed by a mixologist who taught us the history of the Moscow Mule and
then the main act, a Mentalist.  Let  me tell you mentalist magic does not
work very well in a virtual meeting space.  The important thing is that we
looked great and enjoyed drinking from our spiffy Waterford tumblers.



Christmas Lights =F0=9F=98=89

We have gotten into the Christmas spirit here at the Frazier Household.  We
went to a great Christmas store walking distance from our house called
Christmasland.  I wanted to buy everything in that store but we managed to
make it out of there with just a realistic owl, a gnome like figure, some
fake birds, lights and a fairy tree topper.  We decided on a real tree this
year that we will plant at our new home once all the paperwork goes through
which will hopefully be in January.

We also went into Dublin one night to see the lights and have a meal out.
We got some hot apple cider and walked around the city.  Grafton Street was
incredible and well worth the trip! The window displays were some of the
best I have ever seen.  The lights in our neighborhood are a bit
disappointing, there are a few houses with very tasteful displays but there
is nothing that compares to the displays seen in the states.  No Walmart
yards of the year here.



Today is Eric=E2=80=99s last day of work for the year, he has vacation for =
the rest
of December! We are going to celebrate by visiting some museums.  Much like
DC, the national museums here are free we just had to reserve time slots
because of the Covid.  Tomorrow we are going to the Archeology Museum and
the National Gallery.

As we roll into the holiday season, we wish you all safe but limited
travels, virtual hugs, health, and good fortune.  We love and miss you all
very much and wish you were here with us!

Much Love,

Marti and Eric
