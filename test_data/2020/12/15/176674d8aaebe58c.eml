Carl,

Happy nearly-at-the-end-of-2020! I recently chatted with Avery Dennison and
reflected to them that more solid use case material on the RFID/Digital ID
opportunity at Estee might be useful to you.

They came up with the attached deck, which is way more comprehensive than I
was able to be. Let me know if it's helpful in chatting with a senior
retail leader and/or clarifying the potential packaging relationship.

Finally, I've been continuing to kick the tires on GPT-3 and AI-generated
avatars and still think it's fertile ground for Estee in replicating the
makeup counter experience. The level of autonomous personalization is
immense, and whoever nails it first is going to make individual customer
relationships for life!!

Hope you're well and looking forward to reconnecting in the new year,
Josh
