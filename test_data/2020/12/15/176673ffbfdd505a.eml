The IRS statement on International Social Security Agreements seems to
indicate that some countries (including Iceland) have totalization
agreements that allow us to waive the self-employment tax (because we've
paid it locally). See "International Social Security Agreements" here
<https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/self-employment-ta=
x-for-businesses-abroad>
.

The self-employment tax issue may be addressed via the US/Icelandic
Totalization Agreement
<https://www.ssa.gov/international/Agreement_Texts/iceland.html>.
Specifically:

"Where the same activity is considered to be self-employment under the laws
of one Contracting State and employment under the laws of the other
Contracting State, that activity shall be subject to the laws of only the
first Contracting State if the person is a resident of that Contracting
State, and to the laws of only the other Contracting State in any other
case."

Another summary is here
<https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/publications/assets=
/pwc-us-social-security-agreements-with-slovenia-and-iceland.pdf>
:

"Taxpayers with current US FICA wages and income subject to self employment
tax no longer will be subject to FICA/self-employment tax on compensation
earned on or after either February 1, 2019 or March 1, 2019 as a result of
the agreements, if certain requirements are met."

I'm confirming by asking some local sources, but would love to get your
take and / or estimate of what the impact on our tax profile would be!

Gratefully,
Josh
