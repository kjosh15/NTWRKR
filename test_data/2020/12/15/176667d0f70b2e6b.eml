I think that's HUGELY compelling, esp. if we have the "solution" to put
into the associated behavior change. FWIW, this is also an ideal pitch to a
potential acquirer - i.e., you have all the solutions, we'll package that
up and turbocharge it for you.

Do think the visualization needs a bit of work, though. In our next call
let's talk through what a short deck on the process might look like - we
can proof it against Mr. Wilson.
