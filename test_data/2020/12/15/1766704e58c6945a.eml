Just spoke for an hour with this guy:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoisbarrault/

He's on a bunch of boards and is actually advising Accenture on what to
buy. He thinks we're exactly what all of the companies he speaks to needs
right now. He wants a one-pager before a followup call about scaling and
investment.

Thoughts?
