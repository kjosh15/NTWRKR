Josh,

Glad you liked it, and, if you have time, it'd be great to touch base 
again before the holidays.

How are you this coming Friday, the 18th? Say noon, 1pm, or 2pm? Some 
other time?

I'd like to add this quote from the FT which succinctly describes the 
opportunity we stand before:

https://www.ft.com/search?q=monerium:

"Monerium ... can create e-money (effectively digitised fiat currency) 
which can also be traded cross-border without a financial intermediary. 
It could potentially create an explosion in the use of e-money across 
the continent. Much like other cryptocurrency technologies, it could 
also change the balance of power in the financial sector making 
traditional banks less important."

Near term, we are looking for capital with connections and experience 
which helps us launch and scale, and people who can help us execute.

Our stretch goal is the SP500 by 2040, or sooner.

Gisli -> bcc

All the best,

Sveinn

    <p>Josh, <br>
    </p>
    <p>Glad you liked it, and, if you have time, it'd be great to touch
      base again before the holidays.</p>
    <p>How are you this coming Friday, the 18th? Say noon, 1pm, or 2pm?
      Some other time? <br>
    </p>
    <p>I'd like to add this quote from the FT which succinctly describes
      the opportunity we stand before:</p>
    <p><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
        href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=monerium">https://www.ft.com/search?q=monerium</a>:
      <br>
      <br>
      "Monerium ... can create e-money (effectively digitised fiat
      currency) which can also be traded cross-border without a
      financial intermediary. It could potentially create an explosion
      in the use of e-money across the continent. Much like other
      cryptocurrency technologies, it could also change the balance of
      power in the financial sector making traditional banks less
      important."
    </p>
    <p>Near term, we are looking for capital with connections and
      experience which helps us launch and scale, and people who can
      help us execute. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Our stretch goal is the SP500 by 2040, or sooner. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Gisli -&gt; bcc<br>
    </p>
    <p>All the best, <br>
    </p>
    <p>Sveinn <br>

            <p>Great talking to you likewise!</p>
            <p>I am about to send an invite to a Google Drive folder
              with summary and deck, for your eyes only please. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It'd be great to talk again when you've had time to
              digest. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Incidentally, I looked up David Friedman, according 
              Wikipedia he is Patri's father, and David's website has an
              article about Iceland's constitution in the commonwealth
              era. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Modern Iceland has evolved since libertarian days of the
              Viking settlers, but at Monerium we are effectively
              building a "narrow bank" for blockchains inspired by the
              ideas of several well-known economists, including Milton
              Friedman. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And this is by using an established framework for
              financial services in major jurisdiction, e-money in the
              EU. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Which could help displace the current To-Big-To-Fail
              banks and make the financial system more efficient and
              less risky. <br>
            </p>
            <p>As you also mentioned, small and medium sized banks
              should be in favor of a more decentralized approach to
              finance. </p>
            <p>Look forward to talking again at your convenience. <br>
