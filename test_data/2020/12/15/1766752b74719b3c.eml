Yes, that's it. If you can do that I'll put in a quick use case to suit the
conversation we had; he has bought 47 companies in his time so far and does
a ton of advising, and his take is that this is a tool for the CEO who can
understand and wants to orchestrate the whole company. So he's very, very
high level with a strong POV that aligning employees around purpose creates
high performance - we need to orient the pitch around how this creates the
metrics to make that possible.

He's also good friends with Accenture's CEO and has been asked to advise
them on future acquisitions, so we need clarify that we represent
significant value to solution providers as a platform.

Have been in calls since then and am about to hop on another - any help
appreciated as I intend to get something to him by tomorrow afternoon; even
if he doesn't invest himself he can be invaluable in a) helping us
articulate our value to senior investors and introductions to the right
strategics or VC firms.
