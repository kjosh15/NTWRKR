Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all the work you're
putting into this! Unfortunately we're a little bogged down with the
pandemic, kids, holidays, etc., but are hoping to revert with more support
as things slow down a bit. Just wanted to let you know we appreciate
everything!

Also, connecting the machine to audio of cawing and a drum solo is pure
genius. Made my day. :)

All best,
Josh

Here's a couple assets I've generated from the build -- that might be
interesting to share.

Transparent build photo.
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxvomvpmqcscmk0/Transparent%20build.jpeg?dl=3D0>
I wanted to see how well clear PETG worked for the basket. PETG seems to
glue better, but there's a bit more friction (or resistance) on the coins
than with styrene. It also takes on an interesting sheen/micro fissures
kinda thing if you bend it too much. Reminds me of plastics that have been
in the weather for many years so maybe it won't weather well.

Video of transparent build, motion and coin magazine subassembly.
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ka0pj1mppv1cjis/Transparent%20build%20-%20with%2=
0movement%20and%20coin%20magazine.mov?dl=3D0>
Just the motion of the device without the perch, so you can see it better
-- I slot in the coin magazine (and fumble a bit with it, haha) to show
that the design allows for it to just kinda set in there, held in place by
the perch. Might allow for swapping it out for different coins support at
some point, but I wanted something I could easily remove to refill (I have
two I'll cycle through), and that can be replaced with a cover after the
phase is resolved.

Video of CrOS event being rendered as audio, in a browser, using websockets=
.
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6y0k9xgjoschl8/Events%20reflected%20as%20audio%=
20in%20browser.mov?dl=3D0>
Here's the tech aspects all put into practice, with some over the top audio
samples that will be replaced with even more ridiculous audio, and
hopefully animations.

Be the crow you want to see in the world. Collect shiny things, hop happily
down the street for no apparent reason, and scream loudly when you see your
friends.

es. It seems to reduce surface scarring, bonds stronger, isn=E2=80=99t dryi=
ng on tips all the time, and makes for cleaner looking welds (especially in=
 regards to the transparent parts). Because of this these designs don=E2=80=
=99t include notches on tabs that slot together, minimizes holes specifical=
ly for glue, and instead relies on capillary action =E2=80=94 since #3 perm=

/b></div><div><br></div><div>Modular concepts, where various subassemblies =
are intended to be capable of being swapped out. This comes down to four pr=
imary subassembly divisions:</div><div><br></div><div>- The housing subasse=
mbly - the primary box that everything fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid s=
ubassembly - the sliding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit switches, =
and coin magazine</div><div>- The basket subassembly - the face plate and b=
asket that slots onto the housing subassembly</div><div>- The electronics s=
ubassembly - weather resistant box for the the Arduino</div><div><br></div>=
<div>These subassemblies are separated into their component concepts so the=
y can be replaced or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and baske=
t subassemblies aren=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subas=
sembly. They interlock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pi=
ns, and can be removed fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue the=
m in place, you absolutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replace=
d to allow smaller/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instan=
ce, I=E2=80=99m going to be replacing colors and swapping between my two bo=
x placements periodically to see if different colors (or transparency) perf=
orm differently. This aspect of the design removes the need to have any acc=
ess panels.</div><div><br></div><div>Other parts of the design have similar=
 interlocking concepts. This is notable in the assembly steps of the basket=
, as pieces are slotted in from the back of the face plate. The basket ribs=
 are then slid into position and things are bolted together, which creates =
a cohesive and stable subassembly that can then be glued more easily with m=
inimal effort in holding / getting things aligned properly. I may post a co=
uple photos/videos of this on my final build, because the order of operatio=
ns matters a bit here.</div><div><br></div><div>Better weathering potential=
. Drainage holes have been added to the corners of the bottom panel that al=
low moisture to drain (regardless of level / lean orientation). The electro=
nics subassembly allows better whatever level of weatherizing you feel is n=
eeded. I personally have only built the box and then rubber banded one of t=
he panels in place, so I can still easily access the electronics, but since=
 the subassembly is designed to keep a gap between the inner walls of the h=
ousing subassembly it means less water will be touching the surfaces that t=
he electronics are mounted to.</div><div><br></div><div>The basket volume h=
as increased by some ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, b=
ut the basket depth has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding l=
id has 1cm more travel, and is a little more than 2cm wider.=C2=A0 That, an=
d other design tweaks to the basket increase the volume for food, and reduc=
e the area that scraps or other material can accidentally fall it into the =
coin delivery areas. This may have an impact on accidental coin activations=
, but that&#39;s something I plan on running an experiment on -- in this ve=
rsion I actually just wanted to increase volume and will run some tests on =
different aspects of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout and placemen=
t of parts is optimized to get everything onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 3=
1.1=E2=80=9D x 15.1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color parts, and the transparent pa=
rts can be doubled up on a single sheet of the same dimensions. This allows=
 ordering two color sheets and a single (doubled up design) transparent she=
et. So two crowboxes, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I know some laser cutter=
s won=E2=80=99t be able to accommodate that size, but I optimized for what =
was immediately at hand during the pandemic, and that was the capabilities =
of Ponoko.</div><div><br></div><div>Transparent part usage was reduced in t=
he housing subassembly, which means the housing is fully opaque when using =
an opaque acrylic (no transparent parts come through from the back to the f=
ront except for the lid). The logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/=
light or movement could unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one=
 side of the housing to the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom pane=
l has some holes for drainage, and also a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=
=9D of slots that sensors or subhousings can utilize in future revisions or=
 iterations. For instance, the coin sensor uses this interface, as does the=
 electronics subassembly, and each can be mirrored to use the right or left=
 side depending on build or deployment concerns. A similar concept is avail=
able on the bottom of the rails (to hang things from), but that=E2=80=99s n=
ot being utilized in these designs.</div><div><br></div><div>The coin magaz=
ine has more capacity, and is designed to allow more flexibility in movemen=
t (in that it=E2=80=99s not glued to the lid), which makes jamming less lik=
ely (potentially even when using non U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now=
 slots into position, so placement doesn&#39;t require measuring and gluing=
. It&#39;s held in position between the lid and the perch platform using a =
piece of styrene without needing to glue it in place.</div><div><br></div><=
div>There=E2=80=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs,=
 but you=E2=80=99re welcome to hot glue the subassemblies together since it=
=E2=80=99s fairly trivial to remove and might minimize rattling and other n=
oise. I=E2=80=99ve also used <a href=3D"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AS9NA=
S" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">shelf liner</a> to reduce noise from =
dropping coins.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, since I don=E2=80=99t have=
 a better place to document these things, you get this nerdy novella here. =
Hope these designs are useful, and that you=E2=80=99re all staying well and=
 healthy.</div><div><br></div><div>- Jeremy</div><br><div class=3D"gmail_qu=

 brain has totally latched onto this as something I&#39;d like to chip in s=
ome of my free time this winter on. Thanks so much for all of your efforts =
everybody, Josh especially. It&#39;s been really fun to start working on bu=
ilding one, and that&#39;s very much attributed to your massive efforts and=
 all of the material that&#39;s been put together so far.<div><br></div><di=
v>I remember your ted talk from way back and have always loved the idea. Af=
ter some googling I ended up on your project. I was just going to hack toge=
ther some things from a now defunct automatic dog feeder I have sitting aro=
und, but this is so much better!<div><br></div><div>@Josh, what are your th=
oughts on creating a repo or two on github or gitlab? One for the code, and=
 one for the shape files and pdf print templates etc? I&#39;d consider fork=
ing the shape files and making some proposed modifications to them -- I&#39=
;ve got a lot of ideas floating around -- not really &quot;waterproofing it=
&quot;, but minimizing water damage potential and making it more weather re=
sistant (I&#39;m in Colorado so get to do real world testing, haha).</div><=
div><br></div><div>Here are some of the ideas I&#39;ve formed so far and wi=
ll bring as proposals if we had things up on github or gitlab. I know full =
well that a lot of these things may necessitate re-recording some of the re=
ally amazing videos at some time in the future, but I&#39;ve got a couple s=
olutions about how some division in the housing will make it easier to vers=
ion things, including generating new videos in the future.</div><div><ol><l=
i>Add drainage on base panel (drainage holes in all four corners, and small=
 grid of drainage hopes near the coin sensor assembly / coin entrance)</li>=
<li>Move power supply hole to the bottom</li><li>Make the front/basket suba=
ssembly replaceable using 3m nuts/bolts/washers=C2=A0(this would allow for =
minor versions -- v2.0 -&gt; v2.1 could be only adjustments to the the bask=
et subassembly, or changes to improve the base subassembly independently, o=
r testing different material / color options)</li><li>Switch to metric for =
everything (I see inches in some places, and even as an American I don&#39;=
t want to anymore, haha)</li><li>Migrate to using a single limit switch in =
the back of the machine by the perch hook (is there a redundancy reason for=
 the two limit switches that I&#39;m missing maybe?)</li><li>Remove the per=
ch hook and include it into the shape of the perch platform</li><li>Find an=
d utilize a standard adapter measurement for the base reinforcing ring / bo=
lt holes in base panel (for this I mean something like=C2=A0<a href=3D"http=
s://www.globalindustrial.com/g/plumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-=
flanges" rel=3D"nofollow" target=3D"_blank">https://www.globalindustrial.co=
m/g/plumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-flanges</a> -- are there in=
ternational options for this kind of thing as well, or some other standard?=
)</li><li>Add more hex nut shapes that can be glued on the inside (in the F=
inal Assembly - Step 2 video, a couple nuts are hot glued to the inside, bu=
t we should provide pieces like the included hex wrenches that can be glued=
 in places with the washer/bolt -- this would also be part of idea 3)</li><=
li>Provide water resistant housing alternative to the sled (I&#39;d also li=
ke for this to better fit on the shelves / slide in out / potentially be or=
iented vertically on the rear panel instead of horizontally and removing th=
e front sled shelf)</li><li>Remove the need for the soldering iron and rela=
ted steps (I don&#39;t think we need to solder to the limit switch(es) or t=
he alligator clips, crimping things should be enough for solid contact, eve=
n in weathering conditions, right?)</li></ol>Here&#39;s a couple questions =
for you Josh. How concerned are we in terms of cost associated with the hou=
sing build? I don&#39;t plan on making it super expensive or anything, but =
it may be worth having some priorities for which things I can/we optimize t=
owards?<br><div><br></div><div>Like, build quality/durability, simplicity o=
f build, simplicity in ordering, cost of build, flexibility in versioning /=
 color options (I want to do this purely so I can test different colors), f=
lexibility in options (for instance, the housing alternative to the sled), =
etc.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again! It&#39;s been really enjo=
yable to work on the crowbox so far, and if I can, I&#39;d be happy to help=
 out in other ways too. I&#39;m a software engineer, and am interested in d=
iscussing the code / hardware as well -- including a raspberry pi implement=
ation, but that&#39;s an entirely different topic and one I haven&#39;t div=
ed into fully yet.</div>
