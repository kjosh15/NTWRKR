Trying to figure out stocking stuffers for Hulda when the only local shops
are H&M and Body Shop. Any pro tips? I=E2=80=99m getting a little desperate=
!

Hope you all are doing well; we miss the whole family and I poured a dram
on Oct 31 to the first Halloween we did without you. Looking forward to
catching up again in person on future visits!!!

All best wishes,
Josh
