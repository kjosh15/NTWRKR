Laura Maxfield at Samskip suggested I contact you.

I need to ship ~30 boxes (20x20x15") at roughly 50lbs each from Jackson
Heights NYC to Akureyri Iceland in the next few weeks. All boxes are packed
but not palletized. I'd like to use Ocean Freight due to price, and need an
estimate for port to port and port to door.

Laura only ships from Norfolk; can you palletize and get them to her,
and/or do you have any other shipping services to get it to Iceland?

Thanks!
Josh Klein
