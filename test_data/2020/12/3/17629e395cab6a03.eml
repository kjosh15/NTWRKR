Hello!=20
pologies for the delay. I am in CA and was helping my sister with a =
move. I am pushing the bicoastal idea now but think I will mostly be =
based in LA now. It=E2=80=99s been a super weird year and work has been =
minimal. Just trying to figure out how to exist in a post-pandemic world =
as the landscape as dramatically changed. Hope things are well on your =
end! Are you staying in NYC?


Best,
Jen
