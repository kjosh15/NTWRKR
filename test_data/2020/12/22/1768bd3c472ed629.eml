Greetings Friends of IFTF=2C

What a year this has been! 2020 began much like any other year in the 21st=
 century=2C with hopeful New Year=E2=80=99s celebrations worldwide. Then=
=2C an unrelenting series of shocks: devastating wildfires=2C crackdowns a=
gainst pro-democracy demonstrations=2C a presidential impeachment=2C the d=
eadliest pandemic in a century=2C global protests for racial justice=2C an=
 unprecedented attempt to overthrow the U.S. Presidential election=E2=80=
=A6 I could go on=2C but you get the picture.

While many of us are still reeling from what has happened=2C we=E2=80=99re=
 also wiser because of what we=E2=80=99ve experienced. We now have the opp=
ortunity to reset=2C reevaluate=2C and reassess=E2=80=94as we chart a new=
 path forward. There is light at the end of the tunnel=2C but we can=E2=80=
=99t idly sit and wait for the future to unfold.

This is a futures moment=E2=80=94an opportunity to imagine and build the k=
ind of future we want to live in.

That's why=2C earlier this year=2C IFTF got a jump-start on 2021 by develo=
ping aset of four alternative scenarios for a post-pandemic world (https:/=
/www.iftf.org/whathappensnext) . We researched historical patterns=2C inte=
rviewed experts across different fields=2C and conducted panels with worke=
rs and activists. We examined the ingrained beliefs that made us so vulner=
able in 2020 and presented a vision and a set of actions for transformatio=
n. Our Transformation Scenario embraces mutualism and interdependence as c=
ore principles for achieving not just individual=2C but societal well-bein=
g. It invites organizations=2C communities=2C and individuals to participa=
te in making this vision a reality.

Realizing the importance of this moment=2C IFTF provided foresight support=
 to organizations across sectors=2C from philanthropic foundations to gove=
rnments=2C individuals and Fortune 500 companies. Our aim is not only to h=
elp in the moment of crisis=2C but to give those we work with tools for ov=
ercoming the traps of short-termism and discover new visions and possibili=
ties. Our aim is to disrupt short-termism and to transform how people thin=
k and see the world.

Hear how one of our scholarship recipients from Brazil=2C Maria Clara Maga=
lh=C3=A3es=2C describes what learning futures-thinking with us has meant t=
o her:
https://youtu.be/zCXFQ-MDrWU

We are eternally grateful for those individuals and organizations who supp=
ort us by recognizing the value of foresight. We couldn=E2=80=99t do our w=
ork without them. As we close the year=2C we ask our community to consider=
 making a year-end donation that will help us scale our ability to bring t=
he gift of foresight to more diverse communities worldwide and to contribu=
te to our mission to catalyze more equitable and sustainable futures.

Made today=2C your contribution directly supports 2021 IFTF Foresight Esse=
ntials scholarships for those who would otherwise not have access. Please=
 join us by making a tax-deductible year-end gift that will help change li=
ves=2C fight short-termism=2C and support building a better=2C more equita=
ble=2C and sustainable future for all.
