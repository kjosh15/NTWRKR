*TL;DR: Got three couple good contracting options, building towards
Indigo's raise in Q1 2021, and constructing a strategy for M&A in 2022
while preparing for earlier serendipity.*
As the year comes to a close my goals have narrowed, focusing solely on
immediate capital and Indigo's raise. Along the way new opportunities have
opened:

1. Contracting: I'm due to discuss a contract with Takeda starting in Jan.,
and am talking to WhatIf in London (Accenture's new innovation
acquisition), and Human Futures Studio in Toronto (a market
research/innovation firm). Each seems like a reasonable fit and I'm aiming
to fill ~20hrs/week while at my NY rate.

Covid has changed the game and it's interesting to see how everyone is
navigating the hiring/contracting process. My first observation is that, as
ever, pitching yourself as a premium product supersedes most other
conditions.

Finally, I'm signing to host Accenture's innovation podcast!


2. IndigoMetrics: Our pitch deck is almost completed, with some serious
rethinking around the value proposition as a result of conversations with
potential investors. We're simultaneously winnowing down the attributes we
talk about and amping up the global potential. *If you're available, I'd
love to talk over IndigoMetrics' pitch to get your take!*

Concurrently, we have access to a huge list of potential investors, and are
trying to figure out who our targets are:

- VCs are turning out to be potentially our worst option, as our cash flow
is still low (~$500 in 2021) and we have proven results. (VCs like it
better when there is no result to mitigate expectation.) My understanding
is that the market is pushing for serious pressure on valuation as well.

- M&A isn't optimal at our current size as we'd be acquihire (and we only
have two founders), meaning mostly equity instead of cash + likely a poor
valuation.

- This leaves strategic investment where we can leverage their existing
market/platform and sales teams to expand our IP moat while securing a
potential M&A route.

I.e.:

a) *if you know of any strong HR/Data industry leaders we'd love an
introduction*, and

b) *if you know something about the market that contradicts the above,
please correct me*!

Positively, Wharton is interested in doing a study on the platform, W50's
D&I group may use it for a group of ~500 companies, and we're talking to
two additional consultancies about whitelabeling it for them. Finally, one
existing reseller has four mid-size companies in discussion. So, good
indicators!


As ever, I hope you and yours are doing well. In the last month or so I've
been seeing an increasing appetite for insight into technology trends, esp.
around the world of work - if I can be of any help or if you just need a
brain to bounce your thinking off of, please let me know!!

All best wishes,
Josh
