Hi, sorry, lost this thread for a bit.

If this dude wants to fork the repository and maintain it, that should be
fine. It sounds like he changed how the guts of CrOS works, he said
something about switching it to a 'kernel' architecture which implies
messaging.

While I'm happy he's working on WiFi support for Arduinos that have that
feature, CrOS was designed with simplicity in mind- with the idea that the
people who may wish to make changes to how the software works aren't
exactly software engineers. So I exercised a lot of restraint when
designing CrOS to be a closed loop with no threading and no messaging, to
spare amateurs the horrors of trying to debug message queue problems or
problems with out-of-order execution that you can run into with threads.
I'm not sure he's done the latter but the former for sure.

At some point, to get certain features, complexity would have to increase,
but I'm not sure we are there yet. We just need to think about how he will
label his version of the software and how we'll make sure users always
start with the official CrOS software. I think we're pretty safe there
since we direct people to get the software from our webpage, not GitHub.
It's possible he'll go on to do some really cool work, like set up CrOS to
email you when a bird lands or deposits- cool stuff we would really like to
deliver.

We can be hands-off and just invite him to fork the branch then I can look
at his code after he posts it, or we can ask him to submit code for us to
review before that.

I think you know more about what he hopes to do than I do- Tell me what you
need from me.

-Steve

r from you.=C2=A0<div><br></div><div>Dani and I are doing mostly normal stu=
ff now that we&#39;re settled. We got a new dog, a German Shepherd named El=
i, to help us with security around the house and the property. He&#39;s a t=
rained dog so it&#39;s pretty cool. He&#39;s very protective which is also =
awesome. I had an exhaust vent installed in my shop for my laser cutter and=
 had an extra duct installed so that I can get up a spray paint booth later=
. Too cold for that shit now! I have a hydroponics tent out there now with =
a small heater in it to keep the laser tube from freezing this winter. The =
tent accepts ducting so it&#39;ll be easy to get the laser hooked up the re=
st of the way and running.</div><div><br></div><div>Bought a UTV (A Polaris=
 Ranger XP 1000 Northstar Ultimate) (mouthful) and a plow attachment, so I =
can keep our 1/4 mile long driveway plowed this winter. That will be intere=
sting. Eli gets in with me and rides in the passenger seat looking out the =
windshield just like a person. It&#39;s funny. It&#39;s a half-mile to the =
mailbox so I usually drive the UTV down there.</div><div><br></div><div>So,=
 about Jeremy. He&#39;s making incremental changes to a design that I think=
 needs an overhaul. I still feel strongly that we need to do these things:<=
/div><div><br></div><div>-Redesign for more conventional materials. I want =
to design a housing that can be built with low-cost softwood lumber in size=
s that can be purchased at Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s, and can be cut to siz=
e by staff right there in the store so that the builder leaves with materia=
ls that are already cut-to-size. User will still have to drill holes but ot=
herwise I&#39;d like to not require them to own some kind of power saw.=C2=
=A0</div><div><br></div><div>-Relegate Acrylic parts to machinery only. Acr=
ylic machine guts installed inside a wooden box.</div><div><br></div><div>-=
Redesign the lid-perch system to eliminate water incursion.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>-Strongly consider eliminating the servo and replacing it w=
ith a simple DC motor. I&#39;m very concerned about the failure rate on the=
 low-cost servos we rely on, and I don&#39;t think the answer is asking peo=
ple to buy a $25-$30 servo instead of a $6 one, when we could just design f=
or a $5 DC gearmotor.<br></div><div><br></div><div>-Reduce the parts/tools =
count. There are some oddball items that users have to buy (silicone chef r=
ubber bands, metal hitch pins) that increase the cost and procurement times=
 for parts. Where possible, I&#39;d like to eliminate these or replace them=
 with items that can be bought at Home Depot, Lowes, or (gag) Wal-Mart. Mos=
t of the US population has easy access to one or all of these outlets.</div=
><div><br></div><div><div>So it&#39;s a little weird to have someone making=
 incremental changes without our history of knowledge about the compromises=
 we had to make, and the existing known flaws in the physical build. It&#39=
;s not a good sign that he didn&#39;t open a dialog about potential changes=
 before deciding what he thought should change. That&#39;s a bit hostile, e=
ven if not malicious in intent.</div><div><br></div><div>If he does unleash=
 his own version of the Crowbox, we will incur any support issues rising ou=
t of his design changes. How will users know which Crowbox they&#39;re buil=
ding? Our build videos aren&#39;t going to be valid for his modified parts,=
 and if someone starts out building a Crowbox from our instructional videos=
 but using his parts, they may end up chemically welding their parts into u=
seless subassemblies. So what level and quality of instruction and support =
is he prepared to offer for users who want to build his version?=C2=A0</div=
><div></div></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m very concerned about how we&#=
39;d tag and identify his modified Crowbox, for the sake of users who are t=
rying to find build instructions, operating instructions, or technical supp=
ort.</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t have any problem with Jeremy bran=
ching the Github repository but it&#39;s not super clear to me what he&#39;=
d be changing in the software. I assumed that any modifications to the soft=
ware would involve the addition of cameras or other types of sensors, or wi=
fi communication. We would need to review his code submissions to make sure=
 he doesn&#39;t adversely affect the performance or stability of the softwa=
re.</div><div><br></div><div>Over my career I had the opportunity to work w=
ith and learn from very capable professionals who possessed the exceedingly=
 rare ability to be utterly objective about their own work and its viabilit=
y. This is less common among hobbyists and hackers, where building or progr=
amming something to your own satisfaction is NOT the same as building somet=
hing that will then be turned over to the public for use. I don&#39;t know =
where on the Hobbyist&lt;-&gt;Objective Professional spectrum this guy fall=
s but to begin with, I&#39;ll assume way towards Hobbyist. This is a space =
in which I don&#39;t give anyone benefit of the doubt- I have to be convinc=
ed otherwise. But we&#39;d learn a lot about him by looking over his parts =
and his changes to the software.</div><div><br></div><div>By the way, Jerem=
y has a point when it comes to the water-thin #3 formula of Sci-Grip solven=
t. In fact, I use the water thin formula for all of my personal projects an=
d most of the Crowbox prototyping. Application is more precise and this for=
mula chemically welds the parts together much more quickly. However, this s=
tuff evaporates incredibly quickly- you can watch a large puddle of it disa=
ppear in front of you- it takes seconds. Or you can watch your entire $30 c=
an of it evaporate in minutes if you forget to cap it. Also, it must be app=
lied with a syringe and precision applicator tip or a special plastic squee=
ze bottle with precision applicator tip. So there are some materials-handli=
ng concerns with this formula as well as special equipment required. The ot=
her thing he doesn&#39;t know about our experience with the Crowbox is that=
 our recommended syrup-consistency #16 Sci-Grip solvent is that it is parti=
ally thickened with dissolved plastic. This means that the thicker formula =
adds body in addition to welding parts together- it deposits liquid plastic=
 into the joints, which cures to plastic. This is very helpful in making su=
re that [less experienced builders] get the benefit of the gap-filling feat=
ure of the thicker solvent formula. This helps make sure they don&#39;t end=
 up with dry/partial joints or gaps in parts that really need a seal. The #=
16 formula is far more forgiving and the #3 formula requires some skill to =
properly apply and inspection of the finished joints to ensure the weld is =
complete.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>On a Crowbox which features a wood=
 housing, I probably wouldn&#39;t have a problem asking users to use the mo=
re complicated #3 solvent on the internal machine parts. It&#39;d be cleane=
r and, inside the machine, less critical to ensure joints are absolutely co=
mplete.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no argument against a modular desig=
n which can be field-stripped for cleaning, repair, or possibly even upgrad=
ing. It&#39;s something we did not design into this version of the Crowbox =
but the benefits are obvious.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, no trouble le=
tting him branch the GitHub repository. It&#39;s public anyway so we are no=
t set up to stop that, by design. But I really want to figure out how we av=
oid confusing users or running into trouble with his version-and-a-half rel=
eased on the group.</div><div><br></div><div>At a high level, I&#39;m feeli=
ng more like we need to pursue success on our own again. I want to build an=
d operate a Crowbox that functions all the way to Phase Four, including the=
 compliment of participating Crows. I see crows every couple of days here b=
ut they just fly overhead. I bet I could start convincing them to land. We&=
#39;re out in the country on 10 acres, with 5 acres of hay and tall Fescue,=
 so we have lots of wild rodents. I need to figure out a strategy (likely j=
ust an elevated platform) where I could provide peanuts to the crows withou=
t feeding the field mice, too. I also need to make sure I can set up my sit=
e in a way that our various neighbors&#39; roaming barn cats can&#39;t assa=
ult the crows. See, guys who are building contraptions out of ugly discarde=
d fence wood or store-bought plastic Rubbermaid containers are making good =
progress while we branched to design something than anyone could build and =
operate. It feels a bit like the community wants to see the success on YouT=
ube more than they want to participate in achieving the success so we may w=
ant to seriously consider a parallel project where we design and build what=
ever we need to continue our own research, while continuing to support the =
community and their easier-to-build-and-maintain current version of the Cro=
wbox.</div><div><br></div><div>My attention is pretty divided right now, so=
 apologies. This is a very raw data dump on you and I think I wandered a bi=
t. It&#39;d be good to make another attempt to sync up via webchat so that =
I don&#39;t have this huge backlog of thoughts and information that I keep =
trying to express every time we&#39;re discussing some other aspect of the =
project.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div></div><br><div=
