Yes, I'm around.

Morning is the time for a cup of coffee, so how about Friday morning? Say
at 9am.

I don't know where you live but this is a great little spot (Reykjavik
Roasters) near Hallgrimskirkja:

d64.140882!4d-21.928351

If that doesn't work for you we should be able to find another time next
week. Also if you're hesitant to meet IRL in light of Covid19 that's not
a problem at all and we can just meet on Zoom.

Looking forward to hearing about your journey and how life brought you here
