Thanks for the update; I was unaware you were leaving Saturday. Please let
me know:

- How many boxes clothes for the kids
- How many boxes clothes for Hulda and I
- How many boxes kids' books
- Is the entirety of the "second shipment list" in one box?
- Are stuffed animals included in the 7 boxes you listed as being kids'
toys?
- Do you have a revised estimate for the total # of boxes?

At this point we are looking at either shipping everything by sea, or a
preliminary set of boxes by air now AND a set of boxes by sea. If the
latter, we'd want to keep it to ~5 boxes, so will have to be strategic
about what we send (likely kids books and clothing + legos).

Thanks!
- J

P.S. Unfortunately I can't get the Whatsapp VMs to work! Please email/txt
instead.
