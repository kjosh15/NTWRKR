Gotcha. He and I used to hang out while he was doing GRL in NYC years ago.
Super nice guy!!

I'm absolutely flat out today, with calls until 7pm. Can you munge the
following into a functional bio?

"Josh Klein (Producer, Expert Advisor) has advised on new and emerging
technology to senior executives for large multinationals across the S&P
500. His last three books focused on the methods and impact behind
technology innovation, and he's a frequent speaker at events such as TED,
Davos, and events around the world. Josh has hosted two documentary series
on the history of innovation (For National Geographic and Discovery), and
coproduced the series Game Vision on the history and future of Videogames
(For Discovery Asia Pacific). Josh also famously made a device that trains
crows to bring him money."

All best,
Josh
