Hey Josh,
I've sent you some messages couple of years ago about that idea that I had,=
 that i think would help the majority of humans be truly conscious about ou=
r environment and have a way to individually add their own solutions and re=
ally focus on the matter at hand.=C2=A0
Honestly,=C2=A0 at the time I was using way to much cannabis and was way to=
o much in my thoughts.=C2=A0
I have been off of that for a long time now, yet the same concept really ma=
kes so much since to me.=C2=A0
You gave me a great advice , which is to try to explain it in 30 seconds or=
 whatnot ( like an elevator pitch).=C2=A0=C2=A0
I'm gonna attempt to do that to you now.=C2=A0

Imagine a different level to google maps on which you can access any busine=
ss around you, and learn facts ( not opinions ) on how exactly it works, wh=
at, why, as well as how it was done before the current way it's done.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
From the base of the company (or whatnot), outward one click at a time. As =
much as you want to know. Not all of it just put together.=C2=A0But branchi=
ng out as you keep pressing the further questions, and get answers on the c=
urrent situation or how it used to be done.=C2=A0
That would be anything, from water=C2=A0 menagment in your community, to ot=
her communities. From schooling structures to energy types and usages, reas=
ons one is widely used and reasons others are not at the moment. From where=
 your meat and veggies are coming from to how the process goes.=C2=A0Just f=
acts.=C2=A0
It's truly getting to know our surroundings and other people's surroundings=
 by asking those deeper questions and getting answers to it on how it's don=
e now, and how it used to be done. Without opinions.=C2=A0
On the side to that, a social component, under which you personally can giv=
e your own solution that wouldn't be shown on the facts side, but on that s=
ocial potential solutions.There could be a side for opinions there, but it =
wouldn't be shown with the facts.=C2=A0=C2=A0Having the opportunity to give=
 options on how it could be done for the better, or worse.=C2=A0
Under it, there could even be ways that companies could put on rewards for =
the best solution to their particular problems. You can vote for particular=
 solutions, and take into account the reasons for why it would work or why =
it wouldn't.=C2=A0
I think this kind of a system would make people truly knowledgeable and act=
ivated towards making a potentially better present and future for all.=C2=
=A0

I hope you can see my vision of it and see the potential that i see,=C2=A0
let me know either way.
Thank you,=C2=A0Jelena Jankovic
