Chris,

OK, I think we have the right pieces in play in the deck. I have a number
of items I need help with before we start final formatting; I don't think
this will take much time, so we're close.

Slide:

1. Quotes; I know you produced a list of usable quotes at some point in the
past but can't find it. Can you repoint me? Similarly, are you comfortable
with us asking any of our new(er) clients for quotes? David Wilson is top
of my list here.

3. Slides 2 & 3 are pretty different, and I'm not clear on which is better.
What's your opinion?

5. I need a better graph for the bottom right; something that intimates a
hockey stick and is clear and readable. Can you generate?

6. Graph on the competition. The text here gives you an idea of what we
need to show.

7. Data on market size; both a graph and/or some examples would be very
helpful.

8. Is this traction data correct, and can you think of anything to
supplement?

9. This is bombastic as fuck. Feel free to course correct if the hand
waving is too frenetic here.

10. Financials. Can you help with a highly cogent table here?

11. This is completely revamped to appeal to the US investor. Can you live
with it?

Ignore slides past #12; they're just reference.

Hit me with feedback and let's get this polished!
