 box, but we don&#39;t know offhand of a good cable (that is, a nice long c=
able) that can carry 5VDC a long distance and not also involve loss of prec=
ious voltage. Mainly because we never explored it so we don&#39;t have a go=
od idea of cost, and we don&#39;t have data on voltage loss (to wire resist=
ance) across that distance. In the current plans, we very strongly suggest =
(demand, really) that users employ a GFCI outlet and/or an in-line GFCI wit=
h their A/C extension cord to promote safety. If there&#39;s anyone out the=
re who has time/interest/capability to research this we&#39;d love to publi=
sh their results!<br><br>2) Portable power. The demand for this seems huge =
and we did limited preliminary testing quite some time ago, but with some d=
iscouraging results. We tested five banks and only the VOLTAIC brand proper=
ly worked on low-current devices without shutting itself off. The nominal u=
se-case these devices are designed for means that 95% of them have auto-shu=
toff functions which are largely unlabeled. That said, while Voltaic power =
banks are a little expensive they&#39;re less expensive than most in-line G=
FCI switches for extension cords and so could be a good tradeoff for many p=
eople. Is anyone out there able to do an updated study on currently availab=
le Voltaic banks to see which ones DON&#39;T have the auto-shut-off feature=
 so we can point people at good alternatives?<br><br>Much obliged,<br>Josh<=
br><br>P.S. In case you&#39;re skimming the above DON&#39;T JUST BUY a chea=
p 30,000mAh power bank from Amazon and expect it to work! The only vendor w=
e found that produced a workable power bank that didn&#39;t auto-shutoff wa=
s Voltaic, and that was some time ago. Updated research is needed.<br></div=
