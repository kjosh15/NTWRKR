r from you.=C2=A0<div><br></div><div>Dani and I are doing mostly normal stu=
ff now that we&#39;re settled. We got a new dog, a German Shepherd named El=
i, to help us with security around the house and the property. He&#39;s a t=
rained dog so it&#39;s pretty cool. He&#39;s very protective which is also =
awesome. I had an exhaust vent installed in my shop for my laser cutter and=
 had an extra duct installed so that I can get up a spray paint booth later=
. Too cold for that shit now! I have a hydroponics tent out there now with =
a small heater in it to keep the laser tube from freezing this winter. The =
tent accepts ducting so it&#39;ll be easy to get the laser hooked up the re=
st of the way and running.</div><div><br></div><div>Bought a UTV (A Polaris=
 Ranger XP 1000 Northstar Ultimate) (mouthful) and a plow attachment, so I =
can keep our 1/4 mile long driveway plowed this winter. That will be intere=
sting. Eli gets in with me and rides in the passenger seat looking out the =
windshield just like a person. It&#39;s funny. It&#39;s a half-mile to the =
mailbox so I usually drive the UTV down there.</div><div><br></div><div>So,=
 about Jeremy. He&#39;s making incremental changes to a design that I think=
 needs an overhaul. I still feel strongly that we need to do these things:<=
/div><div><br></div><div>-Redesign for more conventional materials. I want =
to design a housing that can be built with low-cost softwood lumber in size=
s that can be purchased at Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s, and can be cut to siz=
e by staff right there in the store so that the builder leaves with materia=
ls that are already cut-to-size. User will still have to drill holes but ot=
herwise I&#39;d like to not require them to own some kind of power saw.=C2=
=A0</div><div><br></div><div>-Relegate Acrylic parts to machinery only. Acr=
ylic machine guts installed inside a wooden box.</div><div><br></div><div>-=
Redesign the lid-perch system to eliminate water incursion.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>-Strongly consider eliminating the servo and replacing it w=
ith a simple DC motor. I&#39;m very concerned about the failure rate on the=
 low-cost servos we rely on, and I don&#39;t think the answer is asking peo=
ple to buy a $25-$30 servo instead of a $6 one, when we could just design f=
or a $5 DC gearmotor.<br></div><div><br></div><div>-Reduce the parts/tools =
count. There are some oddball items that users have to buy (silicone chef r=
ubber bands, metal hitch pins) that increase the cost and procurement times=
 for parts. Where possible, I&#39;d like to eliminate these or replace them=
 with items that can be bought at Home Depot, Lowes, or (gag) Wal-Mart. Mos=
t of the US population has easy access to one or all of these outlets.</div=
><div><br></div><div><div>So it&#39;s a little weird to have someone making=
 incremental changes without our history of knowledge about the compromises=
 we had to make, and the existing known flaws in the physical build. It&#39=
;s not a good sign that he didn&#39;t open a dialog about potential changes=
 before deciding what he thought should change. That&#39;s a bit hostile, e=
ven if not malicious in intent.</div><div><br></div><div>If he does unleash=
 his own version of the Crowbox, we will incur any support issues rising ou=
t of his design changes. How will users know which Crowbox they&#39;re buil=
ding? Our build videos aren&#39;t going to be valid for his modified parts,=
 and if someone starts out building a Crowbox from our instructional videos=
 but using his parts, they may end up chemically welding their parts into u=
seless subassemblies. So what level and quality of instruction and support =
is he prepared to offer for users who want to build his version?=C2=A0</div=
><div></div></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m very concerned about how we&#=
39;d tag and identify his modified Crowbox, for the sake of users who are t=
rying to find build instructions, operating instructions, or technical supp=
ort.</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t have any problem with Jeremy bran=
ching the Github repository but it&#39;s not super clear to me what he&#39;=
d be changing in the software. I assumed that any modifications to the soft=
ware would involve the addition of cameras or other types of sensors, or wi=
fi communication. We would need to review his code submissions to make sure=
 he doesn&#39;t adversely affect the performance or stability of the softwa=
re.</div><div><br></div><div>Over my career I had the opportunity to work w=
ith and learn from very capable professionals who possessed the exceedingly=
 rare ability to be utterly objective about their own work and its viabilit=
y. This is less common among hobbyists and hackers, where building or progr=
amming something to your own satisfaction is NOT the same as building somet=
hing that will then be turned over to the public for use. I don&#39;t know =
where on the Hobbyist&lt;-&gt;Objective Professional spectrum this guy fall=
s but to begin with, I&#39;ll assume way towards Hobbyist. This is a space =
in which I don&#39;t give anyone benefit of the doubt- I have to be convinc=
ed otherwise. But we&#39;d learn a lot about him by looking over his parts =
and his changes to the software.</div><div><br></div><div>By the way, Jerem=
y has a point when it comes to the water-thin #3 formula of Sci-Grip solven=
t. In fact, I use the water thin formula for all of my personal projects an=
d most of the Crowbox prototyping. Application is more precise and this for=
mula chemically welds the parts together much more quickly. However, this s=
tuff evaporates incredibly quickly- you can watch a large puddle of it disa=
ppear in front of you- it takes seconds. Or you can watch your entire $30 c=
an of it evaporate in minutes if you forget to cap it. Also, it must be app=
lied with a syringe and precision applicator tip or a special plastic squee=
ze bottle with precision applicator tip. So there are some materials-handli=
ng concerns with this formula as well as special equipment required. The ot=
her thing he doesn&#39;t know about our experience with the Crowbox is that=
 our recommended syrup-consistency #16 Sci-Grip solvent is that it is parti=
ally thickened with dissolved plastic. This means that the thicker formula =
adds body in addition to welding parts together- it deposits liquid plastic=
 into the joints, which cures to plastic. This is very helpful in making su=
re that [less experienced builders] get the benefit of the gap-filling feat=
ure of the thicker solvent formula. This helps make sure they don&#39;t end=
 up with dry/partial joints or gaps in parts that really need a seal. The #=
16 formula is far more forgiving and the #3 formula requires some skill to =
properly apply and inspection of the finished joints to ensure the weld is =
complete.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>On a Crowbox which features a wood=
 housing, I probably wouldn&#39;t have a problem asking users to use the mo=
re complicated #3 solvent on the internal machine parts. It&#39;d be cleane=
r and, inside the machine, less critical to ensure joints are absolutely co=
mplete.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no argument against a modular desig=
n which can be field-stripped for cleaning, repair, or possibly even upgrad=
ing. It&#39;s something we did not design into this version of the Crowbox =
but the benefits are obvious.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, no trouble le=
tting him branch the GitHub repository. It&#39;s public anyway so we are no=
t set up to stop that, by design. But I really want to figure out how we av=
oid confusing users or running into trouble with his version-and-a-half rel=
eased on the group.</div><div><br></div><div>At a high level, I&#39;m feeli=
ng more like we need to pursue success on our own again. I want to build an=
d operate a Crowbox that functions all the way to Phase Four, including the=
 compliment of participating Crows. I see crows every couple of days here b=
ut they just fly overhead. I bet I could start convincing them to land. We&=
#39;re out in the country on 10 acres, with 5 acres of hay and tall Fescue,=
 so we have lots of wild rodents. I need to figure out a strategy (likely j=
ust an elevated platform) where I could provide peanuts to the crows withou=
t feeding the field mice, too. I also need to make sure I can set up my sit=
e in a way that our various neighbors&#39; roaming barn cats can&#39;t assa=
ult the crows. See, guys who are building contraptions out of ugly discarde=
d fence wood or store-bought plastic Rubbermaid containers are making good =
progress while we branched to design something than anyone could build and =
operate. It feels a bit like the community wants to see the success on YouT=
ube more than they want to participate in achieving the success so we may w=
ant to seriously consider a parallel project where we design and build what=
ever we need to continue our own research, while continuing to support the =
community and their easier-to-build-and-maintain current version of the Cro=
wbox.</div><div><br></div><div>My attention is pretty divided right now, so=
 apologies. This is a very raw data dump on you and I think I wandered a bi=
t. It&#39;d be good to make another attempt to sync up via webchat so that =
I don&#39;t have this huge backlog of thoughts and information that I keep =
trying to express every time we&#39;re discussing some other aspect of the =
project.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div></div><br><div=
