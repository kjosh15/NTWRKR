NP; yourself and Lorna Auerback brought me to an YPO event in 2012. Given
the pandemic I'm trying to reconnect with interesting folks I've spoken to
in the past just to see if there is serendipity in overlapping interests.
Let me know if you think it's worth a brief call in the new year to catch
up!

All best,
Josh
