Julie,

As a small business owner myself I really hate to do this, but I have to
cancel - again. I just lost the one contract I had going and the father who
is staying in our place has decided to stay through January and offered to
finish the packing for us then. I'm hopeful I'll be able to hire you to
move everything to port for transit at the end of January as I'm trying to
negotiate a new contract now, but for the moment I need to put off any
expenses to cover rent. My sincere apologies!!

Sincerely,
Josh
