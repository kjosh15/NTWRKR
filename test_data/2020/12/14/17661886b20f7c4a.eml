This isn't super clear to me. Am I right in saying that it:

Starts with the most senior managers, asking their direct reports to
participate. As each person uses the platform, *their* direct reports are
invited, weighted by:
- Known interactions (most first),
- Those already in Indigometrics,
- Those that would expand coverage most.

This spread is constrained by time and coverage so:
- nobody gets overwhelmed,
- the most comprehensive footprint is organically created, and
- everyone is asked to participate by a person they report directly to.

Is this right?
