It pays the bills... Hearing your story and how you spend much of your 
time at conferences networking has shown me once more, that this is 
maybe just not a job for me. The companies I work with right now are 
super happy, but I don't think I'll ever have the nerve to sustain the 
personal relationships necessary for continuous customer acquisition. I 
am aware that this is shooting myself in the knee, but I'll probably 
keep focusing on products, rather than consultancy.

Best,

David

                            <p>Hi Josh,</p>
                            <p>I think I came up with something that you
                              can help me with: It might still take some
                              time, before I hear back from Rwanda. So I
                              want to see, what my possibilities are as
                              a consultant. What would your first step
                              be, if you were in my position and wanted
                              to get two more customers?</p>
                            <p>Looking forward to hearing how you would
                              approach this.</p>
                            <p>David<br>
                            </p>
