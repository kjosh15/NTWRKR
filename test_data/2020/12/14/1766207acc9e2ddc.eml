Stephanie,

Let me know about your new rate sheet; Greenbacktaxservices.com are
offering a flat $500 fee to do all paperwork and while I know they have
expertise I'm loath to lose you. Right now it looks like we made $37,036.00
in NYC before leaving, and $35,132.39 after arriving here in Iceland - and
the tax rate here is 35-45%. That comes to ~$25k in taxes ($11,110.8 in NYC
and $18,364 in Iceland) and we've only saved $20, so I'm trying to figure
that out. Do you have any insight into what the US side is likely to be at
such a small amount earned, but earned only up to June? Trying to figure
out if we'll be able to save much on what we owe on the US side as the
Icelandic is going to be very up in the air.

Thanks for everything!!
- J
