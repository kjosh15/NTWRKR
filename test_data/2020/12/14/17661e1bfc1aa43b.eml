 Because of the lockdown, the list of sanctuaries will be shorter this year,=
 but they're out there.  So Bah, Humfuck is my response to all things holida=
y-ish.  As a kind of adjunct, I have friends in different parts of the globe=
 who are curious people and critical thinkers, so they enjoy correspondence t=
hroughout the year (face-to-face is the preference, followed by Zoom, follow=
ed by e-mail or actual letter) =E2=80=93 but some do address seasonal change=

kes a =E2=80=9Cwinter=E2=80=9D card for about a dozen of us sprinkled around=
 the earth =E2=80=93 another is a copywriter for the FBI/CIA who writes a se=
asonal short story every year for a select list.  So I=E2=80=99d welcome you=
r observations about anything that comes to your interesting mind, via e-mai=
l or Zoom or carrier pigeon, but not if it=E2=80=99s store bought or seasona=
lly clich=C3=A9d.  I=E2=80=99m sure having young kids changes your perspecti=

appy and Merry seems insulting in any way.

>> You'll have to try much harder than that to insult me, especially if it's=
 just because you don't feel like celebrating the most marketed holiday on e=

dofilia) but avoiding christmas? That, my friend, only makes you more intere=

ish jargon (with all negative connotations attached), or new-age-ish (same),=
 or woo-woo (I think that=E2=80=99s the technical term).  It=E2=80=99s a som=
ewhat esoteric phrase, penned by Woolf to capture experiences that allowed h=
er to step away momentarily from the fears and doubts and deeply wrought obs=
ervations that dominated her fiction and her life, a life that led unfortuna=
tely to a pocketful of stones and a deep dive into a local river.  Sometimes=
 I=E2=80=99ve found those moments to be =E2=80=9Ca consummation devoutly to b=
e wished.=E2=80=9D Because I write stage plays, however, and am never more t=
han a few feet away from a collection of poetry or a piece of fiction, I can=
 perhaps more easily slide off into the grace and eloquence of a line like t=
hat.  I sometimes forget that to one whose mind is normally solving technica=
l problems or dealing with business strategy, a poorly timed/chosen digressi=
on can seem an unnecessary distraction, or sometimes, given the circumstance=
s, even woo-woo silly.  Since I=E2=80=99ve been enjoying our conversations, I=
=E2=80=99m overloading this paragraph with explanation (gilding the silly?),=
 just in case you left that last call thinking, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t hav=

>>=20
>> Similarly, a decade or so ago =E2=80=9Cmoments of being=E2=80=9D might ha=
ve seen unnecessarily woo-woo, but a lot has changed since then. Now I consi=
der your approach laudable; it appears to me to be a search for meaning, and=
 a well considered one at that, as opposed to a thoughtless or unreflected c=
ommitment to a passing sensation otherwise handed to you without experience o=
r personal reference. I look forward to learning more!

 while, trying to wrestle the concept to the floor, but it=E2=80=99s still t=
oo slippery.  Coming from the world of business (president of an ad agency a=
nd owner of my own graphic design firm), and keeping a foot in that water (m=
y consulting and my reading =E2=80=93 Lean Start Up et al), I think I have a=
 head start, but no regular sounding board.  Let me know when and if.
>>=20
>> Very excited to hear more about this; it reflects something I've found my=
self brushing up against but unable to describe; a sensation of quality or i=
neffable elevation of experience embodied, unusually, in the physical. Not s=
