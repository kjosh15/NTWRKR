Hey Josh,

Your rate last year was $500 so it will increase to $750 this year with my
increase in fees and your aboard situation.

Assuming everything is similar to last year (you paid health insurance
premiums of about $22K again) and your total schedule C income is about
$74K, your US federal tax is about $10,000 with or without the foreign tax
paid.  Please give me a call when you can, I just found out something that
will impact you a bit.
