Good to hear from you as well! Yes, I'm now in Fnj=C3=B3skadalur and have l=
eft
the US for the foreseeable future, all thanks to your good efforts! Let me
know if you're ever interested in talking strategy for expanding / focusing
your business inflows; I suspect your services will be quite in demand for
the foreseeable future and am curious if you could improve the kinds of
clients you receive.

All best wishes,
Josh
