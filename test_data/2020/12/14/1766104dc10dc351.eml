Covering the other points:

=20

*	I feel Slide 9 is strong and just starts a discussion
Our proposed valuation is less built on =E2=80=9Cwe expect to take 5% of =
the market and be generating $250k of income a month in 12 months =
time=E2=80=9D and more built on =E2=80=9Cwe are going to create and =
dominate a market=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 so in that context, our main goal =
with the series A is put the building blocks in place that will allow us =
to dominate =E2=80=93 rather than to raise income by X% per annum.
If an investor wants to focus on income they will not invest in us =
=E2=80=93 which is OK by me!
*	Happy to trial Slide 10 but for me the series A is all about =
=E2=80=9Cgetting ready to dominate=E2=80=9D whereas Slide 10 takes the =
formulaic approach around how we are going to =E2=80=9CIncrease income =
by 20% per annum=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 so it fits the wrong narrative as =
above. To me =E2=80=9Cderisk=E2=80=9D is maybe the wrong frame =E2=80=93 =
we are still really risky (and proud of it) because we are trying to =
create a new market and dominate it - but we have put 7 out of the 10 =
building blocks in place to dominate =E2=80=93 now we need to add the =
other 3 =E2=80=93 still a bit of risk to cover off but we are close to =
something that will be worth billions.=20

4. This graph still looks like ass. Is there anything you can do on your =
end to shoot for a wider view?

6. Send me this graph when you get it.

8. I switched "code himself" to "develop" b/c it saying "we coded it =
ourself" feels amateurish. Claiming it's developed in-house is valuable, =
but only inasmuch as we take it as an obvious outcome of our =
capabilities. I.e., your bio spells this out. Otherwise agree with you =
about the logic and am happy to amplify this elsewhere/differently - any =
ideas?

9. Does this slide feel strong? I ask as I got pushback from an investor =
yesterday about our valuation - i.e., a 20mm valuation on $500k of =
income is too aggressive and not worth $3mm investment (was his =
opinion). Just wondering if there's anything else we can show here that =
dresses things up a little, such as expected inbound deals, etc.

10. I hear you about the issues here, and agree that one of our =
strengths is that we've derisked the investment. However, that is not =
(AFAIK) a feature to VCs. Risk is expected; it's the opportunity they're =
eager to have explained to them. Put another way, the fact that we've =
got a solid and derisked opportunity with signed customers and product, =
vision, staff, management expertise, market size etc. doesn't flip any =
of the bits I'm hearing are indicators as being appealing as an =
investment.

Not trying to be pedantic here - perhaps it's just a matter of shopping =
it around enough to find the investor who's aligned - but in the =
meantime these seem like the most popular claims to make the funding ask =
against.

Chris,

Additional questions, revised version attached. If you can get me the =
below I think we're almost down to spit and polish.

1. I need the # of employees for the Technology & Media company

4. Can you regenerate it closer to 750x350 or 800x400? I was able to =
change it but it looks like ass.

5. Is there a graph where features are listed and compared that might be =
more favorable to our "strongly bias-adjusted data, longitudinal =
analysis, and direct-to-action value mapping" feature set? If we can =
include a few more which seem like "nice" features (but not really =
effective) which we also have and the competition doesn't that would =
help paint the picture nicely.

Put another way, we need to emphasize that we're unique in providing =
those elements, and competitive in providing everything else useful the =
competition does. A checkbox graph would be helpful in this, and I seem =
to recall you working on one. What came of it?

6. This graph looks good but not believable. I know I'm being pedantic =
here, but this matters. Is there a ready data source we can use to "make =
the line more jagged" so it appears to reflect an actual real world =
hockey stick of growth?

8. I edited your text somewhat; please approve/edit.

9. Can you abridge the XLS to something that would fit to the left side =
of the screen here? Again, the best example I can think of is a table =
that includes the assumptions as per this deck:

https://alejandrocremades.com/silicon-valley-legend-creates-pitch-deck-te=
mplate-for-entrepreneurs/

Could use your help here.=20

10. You make a good point, but I'm not confident that will entice a US =
investor. Series B sounds great as a followup once you're growing too =
fast to slow down, but this I think this initial round needs to infer =
serious growth immediately. Let me know if you disagree; in the meantime =
I've tried to split the difference.=20

Concept being that until you have a full sales story there isn=E2=80=99t =
any point (raising a series B and) recruiting a 100 person sales team to =
sell the shit out of it. Founders can deal with gaps in a sales story =
=E2=80=93 sales people cannot.

Although given the activities of Lane 4=E2=80=99s sales people over the =
last few months =E2=80=93 maybe there aren=E2=80=99t that many gaps even =
now=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. But then again they use the =
Lane 4 profile to get past the limitations that I have listed above =
=E2=80=93 so closing the gaps is more for our own sales effort than JV =
sales effort.

I think the Series A is more about the above than feature development. =
Of course we will develop features (or else I will be really bored) but =
we already really feature rich.

Chris,

OK, I think we have the right pieces in play in the deck. I have a =
number of items I need help with before we start final formatting; I =
don't think this will take much time, so we're close.=20

Slide:

1. Quotes; I know you produced a list of usable quotes at some point in =
the past but can't find it. Can you repoint me? Similarly, are you =
comfortable with us asking any of our new(er) clients for quotes? David =
Wilson is top of my list here.

3. Slides 2 & 3 are pretty different, and I'm not clear on which is =
better. What's your opinion?

5. I need a better graph for the bottom right; something that intimates =
a hockey stick and is clear and readable. Can you generate?

6. Graph on the competition. The text here gives you an idea of what we =
need to show.

7. Data on market size; both a graph and/or some examples would be very =
helpful.

8. Is this traction data correct, and can you think of anything to =
supplement?

9. This is bombastic as fuck. Feel free to course correct if the hand =
waving is too frenetic here.

10. Financials. Can you help with a highly cogent table here?

11. This is completely revamped to appeal to the US investor. Can you =
live with it?

Ignore slides past #12; they're just reference.

Hit me with feedback and let's get this polished!

our strengths is that we've derisked the investment. However, that is =
not (AFAIK) a feature to VCs. Risk is expected; it's the opportunity =
they're eager to have explained to them. Put another way, the fact that =
we've got a solid and derisked opportunity with signed customers and =

flip any of the bits I'm hearing are indicators as being appealing as an =

below I think we're almost down to spit and polish.<br><br>1. I need the =

regenerate it closer to 750x350 or 800x400? I was able to change it but =
it looks like ass.<br><br>5. Is there a graph where features are listed =
and compared that might be more favorable to our &quot;strongly =
bias-adjusted data, longitudinal analysis, and direct-to-action value =
mapping&quot; feature set? If we can include a few more which seem like =
&quot;nice&quot; features (but not really effective) which we also have =
and the competition doesn't that would help paint the picture =
nicely.<br><br>Put another way, we need to emphasize that we're unique =

this, and I seem to recall you working on one. What came of =
it?<br><br>6. This graph looks good but not believable. I know I'm being =

somewhat; please approve/edit.<br><br>9. Can you abridge the XLS to =
something that would fit to the left side of the screen here? Again, the =

will entice a US investor. Series B sounds great as a followup once =
you're growing too fast to slow down, but this I think this initial =
round needs to infer serious growth immediately. Let me know if you =

size; both a graph and/or some examples would be very helpful.<br><br>8. =
Is this traction data correct, and can you think of anything to =
supplement?<br><br>9. This is bombastic as fuck. Feel free to course =
correct if the hand waving is too frenetic here.<br><br>10. Financials. =
Can you help with a highly cogent table here?<br><br>11. This is =
