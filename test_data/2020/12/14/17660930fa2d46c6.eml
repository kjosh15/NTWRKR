Chris,

Thanks again or the calls this weekend - excited to learn about your
framework and to see how it pays off!

You had a few questions about Indigometrics w/regards to your call w/ Apex:

1. # of clients: 18-25 (depending on whether you count small divisions of
20 people within a larger company, for example). 18 is a confident number
for "real" company engagements. That includes 2 multinationals (one US, one
UK), with 4 multinationals in the pipeline.

2. How much $ we're making monthly now: $0 Due to contracts ramping up plus
turnaround times in contract payments.

3. How much $ by month 6 from now?: $100k/month Again, everyone pays
forward from present, so this amount is also delayed. If you look at
payments 12 months from now it's $500k/month based on signed contracts.

I'll be working over the financial template you sent with my cofounder
later this week - thanks again!

- J
