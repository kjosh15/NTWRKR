al build. It&#39;s not a good sign that he didn&#39;t open a dialog about p=
otential changes before deciding what he thought should change. That&#39;s =
a bit hostile, even if not malicious in intent.</div><div><br></div><div>If=
 he does unleash his own version of the Crowbox, we will incur any support =
issues rising out of his design changes. How will users know which Crowbox =
they&#39;re building? Our build videos aren&#39;t going to be valid for his=
 modified parts, and if someone starts out building a Crowbox from our inst=
ructional videos but using his parts, they may end up chemically welding th=
eir parts into useless subassemblies. So what level and quality of instruct=
ion and support is he prepared to offer for users who want to build his ver=
sion?=C2=A0</div><div></div></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m very concerne=
d about how we&#39;d tag and identify his modified Crowbox, for the sake of=
 users who are trying to find build instructions, operating instructions, o=
r technical support.</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t have any problem =
with Jeremy branching the Github repository but it&#39;s not super clear to=
 me what he&#39;d be changing in the software. I assumed that any modificat=
ions to the software would involve the addition of cameras or other types o=
f sensors, or wifi communication. We would need to review his code submissi=
ons to make sure he doesn&#39;t adversely affect the performance or stabili=
ty of the software.</div><div><br></div><div>Over my career I had the oppor=
tunity to work with and learn from very capable professionals who possessed=
 the exceedingly rare ability to be utterly objective about their own work =
and its viability. This is less common among hobbyists and hackers, where b=
uilding or programming something to your own satisfaction is NOT the same a=
s building something that will then be turned over to the public for use. I=
 don&#39;t know where on the Hobbyist&lt;-&gt;Objective Professional spectr=
um this guy falls but to begin with, I&#39;ll assume way towards Hobbyist. =
This is a space in which I don&#39;t give anyone benefit of the doubt- I ha=
ve to be convinced otherwise. But we&#39;d learn a lot about him by looking=
 over his parts and his changes to the software.</div><div><br></div><div>B=
y the way, Jeremy has a point when it comes to the water-thin #3 formula of=
 Sci-Grip solvent. In fact, I use the water thin formula for all of my pers=
onal projects and most of the Crowbox prototyping. Application is more prec=
ise and this formula chemically welds the parts together much more quickly.=
 However, this stuff evaporates incredibly quickly- you can watch a large p=
uddle of it disappear in front of you- it takes seconds. Or you can watch y=
our entire $30 can of it evaporate in minutes if you forget to cap it. Also=
, it must be applied with a syringe and precision applicator tip or a speci=
al plastic squeeze bottle with precision applicator tip. So there are some =
materials-handling concerns with this formula as well as special equipment =
required. The other thing he doesn&#39;t know about our experience with the=
 Crowbox is that our recommended syrup-consistency #16 Sci-Grip solvent is =
that it is partially thickened with dissolved plastic. This means that the =
thicker formula adds body in addition to welding parts together- it deposit=
s liquid plastic into the joints, which cures to plastic. This is very help=
ful in making sure that [less experienced builders] get the benefit of the =
gap-filling feature of the thicker solvent formula. This helps make sure th=
ey don&#39;t end up with dry/partial joints or gaps in parts that really ne=
ed a seal. The #16 formula is far more forgiving and the #3 formula require=
s some skill to properly apply and inspection of the finished joints to ens=
ure the weld is complete.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>On a Crowbox which=
 features a wood housing, I probably wouldn&#39;t have a problem asking use=
rs to use the more complicated #3 solvent on the internal machine parts. It=
&#39;d be cleaner and, inside the machine, less critical to ensure joints a=
re absolutely complete.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no argument against=
 a modular design which can be field-stripped for cleaning, repair, or poss=
ibly even upgrading. It&#39;s something we did not design into this version=
 of the Crowbox but the benefits are obvious.</div><div><br></div><div>Agai=
n, no trouble letting him branch the GitHub repository. It&#39;s public any=
way so we are not set up to stop that, by design. But I really want to figu=
re out how we avoid confusing users or running into trouble with his versio=
n-and-a-half released on the group.</div><div><br></div><div>At a high leve=
l, I&#39;m feeling more like we need to pursue success on our own again. I =
want to build and operate a Crowbox that functions all the way to Phase Fou=
r, including the compliment of participating Crows. I see crows every coupl=
e of days here but they just fly overhead. I bet I could start convincing t=
hem to land. We&#39;re out in the country on 10 acres, with 5 acres of hay =
and tall Fescue, so we have lots of wild rodents. I need to figure out a st=
rategy (likely just an elevated platform) where I could provide peanuts to =
the crows without feeding the field mice, too. I also need to make sure I c=
an set up my site in a way that our various neighbors&#39; roaming barn cat=
s can&#39;t assault the crows. See, guys who are building contraptions out =
of ugly discarded fence wood or store-bought plastic Rubbermaid containers =
are making good progress while we branched to design something than anyone =
could build and operate. It feels a bit like the community wants to see the=
 success on YouTube more than they want to participate in achieving the suc=
cess so we may want to seriously consider a parallel project where we desig=
n and build whatever we need to continue our own research, while continuing=
 to support the community and their easier-to-build-and-maintain current ve=
rsion of the Crowbox.</div><div><br></div><div>My attention is pretty divid=
ed right now, so apologies. This is a very raw data dump on you and I think=
 I wandered a bit. It&#39;d be good to make another attempt to sync up via =
webchat so that I don&#39;t have this huge backlog of thoughts and informat=
ion that I keep trying to express every time we&#39;re discussing some othe=
r aspect of the project.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></di=
