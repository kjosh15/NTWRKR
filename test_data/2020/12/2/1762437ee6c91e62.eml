I believe you can cancel the Starfield SSL and save the $75 (unless it's
somehow specifically required by the security package). We're covered by
the Let's Encrypt SSL, which is free. You should also cancel the Grid
Service hosting plan, which we are not using any more. Both of these
actions require the owner of the account.

Matan,<br>
<br>
Your Starfield SSL certificate for <a href=3D"http://fithit.com" rel=3D"nor=
eferrer" target=3D"_blank">fithit.com</a> will renew on December=C2=A0 5, 2=
020. Follow the steps below so you can continue protecting your site--and v=
istors--with powerful authentication and encryption.<br>
<br>
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO<br>
<br>
There are a few things you need to do regarding your SSL certificate renewa=
l.<br>
<br>
1. Validate domain ownership for your certificate, if required.<br>
<br>
In the unlikely case your certificate is flagged by Starfield for additiona=
l validation, you&#39;ll receive an email from Starfield with further instr=
uctions. Please respond promptly so that your service is not interrupted. <=
br>
<br>
2. Check Account Center for your new certificate.<br>
<br>
You will receive an email from Starfield when your new SSL certificate is i=
ssued. Your new certificate should be issued about five days before your cu=
rrent certificate expires, so that you have time to install it.<br>
<br>
3. Install your certificate.<br>
<br>
Once approved and renenwed, the certificate will be available to install vi=
a Account Center.<br>
<br>
If you would like more information about renewing an SSL certificate, pleas=
