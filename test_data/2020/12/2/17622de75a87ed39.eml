That said, I think it's *highly likely* that it will get to a point of
being genuinely persuasive quickly. We would need to check with an AI
expert to confirm this, though.

The only way to do this is to control the content it consumes (too late on
GPT-3, and almost impossible to do at scale with a homespun system) as well
as everything people say to it.

This is a key point for creating a TV property out of this: the system will
reflect what it is given. Because it is mostly trained on Wikipedia and
existing media, it will be sexist, racist, and hateful - because that is
the bulk of the content that exists in the world today. Further, as it
talks to people - who may themselves be sexist, racist, and hateful -it
will learn to be the same.

I.e., we need to use this as a feature, not a bug. If GPT-3 starts spouting
racist rhetoric to flat-earthers because that's what convinces them not to
believe the earth is flat, that's on us humans, not the tech.
