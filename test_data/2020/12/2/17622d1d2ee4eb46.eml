Awesome, thanks!

I think the EU isn't quite to the sigh-of-relief stage yet given its COVID
resurgences, but def. there's some relief that Trump is (somewhat
peacefully) departing. Everyone is keenly aware that he's aiming at 2024,
however - and the fact that he didn't lose by a landslide is extremely
alarming. As someone on Reddit put it, "The U.S. used to be like my
friend's cool older brother, and we just found out he has a meth habit."
