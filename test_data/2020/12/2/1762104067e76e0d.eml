Here's a couple assets I've generated from the build -- that might be=20
interesting to share.

Transparent build photo.=20
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxvomvpmqcscmk0/Transparent%20build.jpeg?dl=3D0>
I wanted to see how well clear PETG worked for the basket. PETG seems to=20
glue better, but there's a bit more friction (or resistance) on the coins=
=20
than with styrene. It also takes on an interesting sheen/micro fissures=20
kinda thing if you bend it too much. Reminds me of plastics that have been=
=20
in the weather for many years so maybe it won't weather well.

Video of transparent build, motion and coin magazine subassembly.=20
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ka0pj1mppv1cjis/Transparent%20build%20-%20with%2=
0movement%20and%20coin%20magazine.mov?dl=3D0>
Just the motion of the device without the perch, so you can see it better=
=20
-- I slot in the coin magazine (and fumble a bit with it, haha) to show=20
that the design allows for it to just kinda set in there, held in place by=
=20
the perch. Might allow for swapping it out for different coins support at=
=20
some point, but I wanted something I could easily remove to refill (I have=
=20
two I'll cycle through), and that can be replaced with a cover after the=20
phase is resolved.

Video of CrOS event being rendered as audio, in a browser, using websockets=
.=20
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6y0k9xgjoschl8/Events%20reflected%20as%20audio%=
20in%20browser.mov?dl=3D0>
Here's the tech aspects all put into practice, with some over the top audio=
=20
samples that will be replaced with even more ridiculous audio, and=20
hopefully animations.

- Jeremy =F0=9F=A4=98

Be the crow you want to see in the world. Collect shiny things, hop happily=
=20
down the street for no apparent reason, and scream loudly when you see your=
=20
friends.

br></div><div><b>Noteworthy features:</b></div><div><br></div><div>Modular =
concepts, where various subassemblies are intended to be capable of being s=
wapped out. This comes down to four primary subassembly divisions:</div><di=
v><br></div><div>- The housing subassembly - the primary box that everythin=
g fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid subassembly - the sliding lid / rails,=
 lid, perch platform, limit switches, and coin magazine</div><div>- The bas=
ket subassembly - the face plate and basket that slots onto the housing sub=
assembly</div><div>- The electronics subassembly - weather resistant box fo=
r the the Arduino</div><div><br></div><div>These subassemblies are separate=
d into their component concepts so they can be replaced or adjusted individ=
ually. For instance, the lid and basket subassemblies aren=E2=80=99t glued =
to each other, or to the housing subassembly. They interlock and hold each =
other in place using a couple hitch pins, and can be removed fairly easily =
for servicing. If you want to glue them in place, you absolutely can, but t=
he idea is that aspects can be replaced to allow smaller/more targeted expe=
riments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance, I=E2=80=99m going to be replacing=
 colors and swapping between my two box placements periodically to see if d=
ifferent colors (or transparency) perform differently. This aspect of the d=
esign removes the need to have any access panels.</div><div><br></div><div>=
Other parts of the design have similar interlocking concepts. This is notab=
le in the assembly steps of the basket, as pieces are slotted in from the b=
ack of the face plate. The basket ribs are then slid into position and thin=
gs are bolted together, which creates a cohesive and stable subassembly tha=
t can then be glued more easily with minimal effort in holding / getting th=
ings aligned properly. I may post a couple photos/videos of this on my fina=
l build, because the order of operations matters a bit here.</div><div><br>=
</div><div>Better weathering potential. Drainage holes have been added to t=
he corners of the bottom panel that allow moisture to drain (regardless of =
level / lean orientation). The electronics subassembly allows better whatev=
er level of weatherizing you feel is needed. I personally have only built t=
he box and then rubber banded one of the panels in place, so I can still ea=
sily access the electronics, but since the subassembly is designed to keep =
a gap between the inner walls of the housing subassembly it means less wate=
r will be touching the surfaces that the electronics are mounted to.</div><=
div><br></div><div>The basket volume has increased by some ~15-20%? No, I d=
idn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, but the basket depth has increased a f=
ull 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding lid has 1cm more travel, and is a litt=
le more than 2cm wider.=C2=A0 That, and other design tweaks to the basket i=
ncrease the volume for food, and reduce the area that scraps or other mater=
ial can accidentally fall it into the coin delivery areas. This may have an=
 impact on accidental coin activations, but that&#39;s something I plan on =
running an experiment on -- in this version I actually just wanted to incre=
ase volume and will run some tests on different aspects of this.</div><div>=
<br></div><div>The layout and placement of parts is optimized to get everyt=
hing onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=E2=80=9D x 15.1=E2=80=9D) sheet f=
or color parts, and the transparent parts can be doubled up on a single she=
et of the same dimensions. This allows ordering two color sheets and a sing=
le (doubled up design) transparent sheet. So two crowboxes, in only 3 sheet=
s of acrylic. I know some laser cutters won=E2=80=99t be able to accommodat=
e that size, but I optimized for what was immediately at hand during the pa=
ndemic, and that was the capabilities of Ponoko.</div><div><br></div><div>T=
ransparent part usage was reduced in the housing subassembly, which means t=
he housing is fully opaque when using an opaque acrylic (no transparent par=
ts come through from the back to the front except for the lid). The logic h=
ere was to reduce areas where shadows/light or movement could unpredictably=
 transfer (visually speaking) from one side of the housing to the other.</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>The bottom panel has some holes for drainage, and al=
so a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D of slots that sensors or subhousi=
ngs can utilize in future revisions or iterations. For instance, the coin s=
ensor uses this interface, as does the electronics subassembly, and each ca=
n be mirrored to use the right or left side depending on build or deploymen=
t concerns. A similar concept is available on the bottom of the rails (to h=
ang things from), but that=E2=80=99s not being utilized in these designs.</=
div><div><br></div><div>The coin magazine has more capacity, and is designe=
d to allow more flexibility in movement (in that it=E2=80=99s not glued to =
the lid), which makes jamming less likely (potentially even when using non =
U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now slots into position, so placement do=
esn&#39;t require measuring and gluing. It&#39;s held in position between t=
he lid and the perch platform using a piece of styrene without needing to g=
lue it in place.</div><div><br></div><div>There=E2=80=99s basically no need=
 for hot glue in any of these designs, but you=E2=80=99re welcome to hot gl=
ue the subassemblies together since it=E2=80=99s fairly trivial to remove a=
nd might minimize rattling and other noise. I=E2=80=99ve also used <a href=

oise from dropping coins.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, since I don=E2=
