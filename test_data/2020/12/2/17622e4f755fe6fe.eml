Thanks, Konrad!! Let me know if you do a paperback. We're at:

Vidifell
607 Akureyri
Iceland

Amen to kids and opinions... my favorite example of this is from a fellow
parent who lost an entire evening because his kid vehemently insisted on
sitting at the head of the table, which was round.

BTW, what did you do to improve your Russian, and how comfortable do you
feel with it now?

We did Thanksgiving, which was super fun. All my in-laws were shocked that
you could make pie out of squash. I hope you had a good one also!

All best,
Josh
