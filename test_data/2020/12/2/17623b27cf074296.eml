Kiddi,

Thanks for the conversation today! I'll let you know how the hangikj=C3=B6t
comes out...

If Hildur is willing to connect reg. Kria that would be hugely helpful,
and/or if you can think of anyone else in the community that I might be
able to assist or to whose efforts I could add value I'm quite keen. My
wife jokes that I've been saying Iceland's startup community is about to
blow up for the past ten years, and that now it's time for me to put my
money where my mouth is!

Separately, let me know when you're getting close to a NYC move - there's a
LOT of folks you should meet and/or connect with before hand. What an
adventure you're signed up for now!!!

Gratefully.
Josh
