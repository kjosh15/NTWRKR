Mat and Paul,

Pleasure speaking with you both yesterday! It was very encouraging to hear
such alignment on what you're looking to build and the work you're looking
to do.

I've attached my CV, Board CV, and Presskit, and you can find more info on
my website <http://josh.is>. My last couple books are here
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1137279966/ref=3Ddbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi=
_i3>
and here
<https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Work-Breaking-Stupid-Results/dp/B004KAB596/=
ref=3Dtmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=3DUTF8&qid=3D&sr=3D>,
and examples of past speeches and tv series are here
<https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5134902/?ref_=3Dfn_nm_nm_1>.

Most of the recent work I've done is obviously not available to share, but
I can reference doing the tech strategy for IDEO in their NY office last
fall, coaching Corning's leadership on innovation methodologies for a year
prior to that, and providing advising services to executives from the CTO
of BP to the CEO of Merck to the CTO of Estee Lauder in that same time
period.

A more complete recent client list is here <https://www.josh.is/clients/>
and some very light case studies here <https://www.josh.is/case_studies/>.
Recent projects include working with Avery Dennison on their RFID growth
strategy, producing a project pitch through CAA to leverage Cardi B's
network in the election, and developing a TV series for the BBC based on
GPT-3 and Deepfakes.

Please send materials in kind; I'm very keen to see some case studies,
examples of research, and some example client lists so I can get a better
idea of your methodologies, work outcomes, and potential targets!

All best,
Josh
