             On a different note, I=E2=80=99ve been asked to lead&nbsp;a 20=
-day voyage to the Antarctic Peninsula with&nbsp;
             <a href=3D"https://insiderexpeditions.com/" target=3D"_blank">=
Insider Expeditions</a>&nbsp;from 26th November to 15th December next year,=
 on one of the most structurally and technologically advanced class of pola=
r ship to date, and one of the most environmentally friendly vessels ever t=
o visit Antarctic waters. The objective is to see the solar eclipse (the ne=
xt time it will be visible from Antarctica will be in 2039!) but also to br=
ing a likeminded group of global citizens together for a unique journey tha=
t will be as much about connection, conversation, inspiration and co-creati=
ng a meaningful legacy as it will be about&nbsp;witnessing a v rare natural=
 phenomenon in&nbsp;the most stunning natural environment on&nbsp;the plane=
t.

             The group will be relatively small (50 max) and we=E2=80=99re =
partnering with the non-profit Students on Ice =E2=80=93&nbsp;
             <a href=3D"https://studentsonice.com/" target=3D"_blank">https=

             Given the collective ambition for this journey, I wondered if =
there could be scope to talk to World 50 about offering their members the o=
pportunity to join. I don=E2=80=99t know the organisation at all, but I=E2=

                     Ben,
                     <br>
                     <br>Thanks again for the call yesterday; it was so goo=
d to catch up!! I'd mentioned a few contacts - take a look and let me know =
if/which you'd like an intro to:
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <ul>
                      <li>Texas Crew Productions (<a href=3D"http://www.tex=
ascrew.com/" target=3D"_blank">www.texascrew.com</a>) - I've worked on a co=
uple tv pitches and really like them, but they're not especially deep into =
Netflix yet. Could be useful for context, however, as they've done a lot of=
 different kinds of work.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li><a href=3D"http://nhnz.tv/" target=3D"_blank">NHN=
Z.TV</a> - I've done two series with these guys; they're apparently now wel=
l connected with Netflix. Based in NZ.</li>
                      <li><a href=3D"http://grrco.com/" target=3D"_blank">g=
rrco.com</a> - This is my friend Matt; we're pitching an AI-powered show to=
gether atm and he's great. Worth talking to regardless of what you do,&nbsp=
;he's got a very very cutting edge understanding of the media landscape tod=
ay.</li>
                      <li>Alan Gershenfeld - Head of <a href=3D"http://elin=
emedia.com/" target=3D"_blank">elinemedia.com</a>. If you're into narrative=
, he's worth talking to. Plus, he built a game about the arctic and is deep=
ly focused on environmental issues. If nothing else I suspect you'd enjoy e=
ach other!</li>
                     </ul>
                     <br>Separately, I'd love an intro to your former Korn =

 Jack Kreindler and Sami Inkinen about the CGM project if that's still poss=
ible.=20
                     <br>
                     <br>Very much obliged - keep in touch and looking forw=
