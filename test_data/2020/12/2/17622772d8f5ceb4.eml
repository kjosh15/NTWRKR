Matan,

Your Starfield SSL certificate for fithit.com will renew on December  5,
2020. Follow the steps below so you can continue protecting your site--and
vistors--with powerful authentication and encryption.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

There are a few things you need to do regarding your SSL certificate
renewal.

1. Validate domain ownership for your certificate, if required.

In the unlikely case your certificate is flagged by Starfield for
additional validation, you'll receive an email from Starfield with further
instructions. Please respond promptly so that your service is not
interrupted.

2. Check Account Center for your new certificate.

You will receive an email from Starfield when your new SSL certificate is
issued. Your new certificate should be issued about five days before your
current certificate expires, so that you have time to install it.

3. Install your certificate.

Once approved and renenwed, the certificate will be available to install
via Account Center.

If you would like more information about renewing an SSL certificate,
please visit this step by step instruction guid in our Knowledge Base
article: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204645090/
Thanks again for choosing Media Temple.

Best Regards,
Media Temple


Disclaimer: Starting September 1, 2020 browsers will no longer trust SSLs
with validity periods longer than 398 days. As such, if you purchase an SSL
certificate that is longer than one (1), upon that anniversary you will be
required to re-validate and re-install your certificate.
