Mike,

I've got a potential event for W50 members - my friend Ben Saunders
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Saunders_(explorer)> is leading up a
20-day voyage to the Antarctic Peninsula with Insider Expeditions from 26th
November to 15th December next year, on one of the most structurally and
technologically advanced class of polar ship to date, and one of the most
environmentally friendly vessels ever to visit Antarctic waters.

The objective is to see the solar eclipse (the next time it will be visible
from Antarctica will be in 2039!) but also to bring a like-minded group of
global citizens together for a unique journey that will be as much about
connection, conversation, inspiration and co-creating a meaningful legacy
as it will be about witnessing a very rare natural phenomenon in the most
stunning natural environment on the planet.

The group will be relatively small (50 max) and they=E2=80=99re partnering =
with the
non-profit Students on Ice =E2=80=93 https://studentsonice.com/ =E2=80=93 b=
oth to further
their extraordinary work, and to enable eight of their young beneficiaries
to join the expedition.

Is this something W50 might like to be a part of? More info here

All best,
Josh
