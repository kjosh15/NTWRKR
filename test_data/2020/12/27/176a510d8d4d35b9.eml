Looked through their material briefly and it seems like a good fit - heavy
emphasis on integration and access to customers, both of which are big wins
on our end. They state they have a focus on integrity, values, and
innovation, meaning we ought to be well aligned... except that=E2=80=99s al=
so a lot
of what you hear from everyone.

My biggest concern is what we don=E2=80=99t know about; potential competito=
rs
internally or in their pipeline. The integration cloud gives us an easy
entreat to their portfolio, and I think we can readily accelerate adoption
on both sides. What did your man inside say?
