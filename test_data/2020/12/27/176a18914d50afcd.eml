Hello! Lately there have been some questions about modifying the CrOS=20
operating system so it seems the right time to point out that there is a=20
GitHub repository for the CrOS source code:

https://github.com/CrowBox/cros

The Crowbox is a fully open-sourced project; both the hardware and software=
=20
are offered to the public and we encourage anyone who is interested to make=
=20
their own contributions to the project.

We don=E2=80=99t have a formal =E2=80=9CBest Practices=E2=80=9D document bu=
t there is a single core=20
concept that we tried to adhere to as we designed the CrOS software:=20
Simplicity.

Mainly, we wanted to ensure that anyone who wanted to modify the CrOS=20
software could do so easily and safely. We tried to write plain, clear,=20
heavily-commented code that would be accessible even to those without much=
=20
programming experience.

This is why the CrOS software is essentially one big loop which runs with=
=20
no messaging, no threads, and no delayed execution. Tasks which take a long=
=20
time, such as opening and closing the sliding lid, are blocking operations=
=20
by design. By employing one single inner loop and blocking calls, we feel=
=20
that we=E2=80=99re helping amateur programmers avoid the most confounding c=
lass of=20
bugs- Bugs caused by code that executes at unexpected times.

Certainly it=E2=80=99s possible to build CrOS with features that more close=
ly=20
resemble a true operating system, but we intentionally avoided this model=
=20
to keep things simple for end users.

It has always been our hope that CrOS users would eventually require=20
features to allow for internet connectivity, wireless communication, and=20
interfacing with cameras or other sensors. Some of these features can be=20
added without increasing the complexity of the Crowbox too much, and other=
=20
features bring with them overhead that will require the CrOS code to become=
=20
more complex.=20

If you decide to publish a modified version of the CrOS software, please=20
create a fork in the GitHub repository and please accept the responsibility=
=20
of documenting and supporting your version of the code.

We=E2=80=99re always around here on the Google Group if you have questions,=
=20
concerns or ideas.

-Steve
