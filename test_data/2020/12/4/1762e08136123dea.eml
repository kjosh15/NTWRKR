Just spoke to these guys <http://jahaniandassociates.com>. I knew we were a
little small (and had no strategic interest in the middle east) but wanted
to get his read. He was very clear that we were in the right space at the
right time, that the remote worker approach was spot on, and that our
growth path seemed strong and well constructed.

He was clear that we were too small for him to help at this point, and felt
pretty strongly that at our size we'd be looking at an equity/acquahire
instead of a cash purchase. He also thought that any VCs we spoke to would
undervalue us so aggressively that we were better off eating the risk in
getting time to grow or be locked into the endless rounds needed to meet a
10x expectation (whether explicit or inferred).

Overall his take was that in a years' time we were going to have the
financials and evidence to make a real pitch for serious
investment/partnership, but that right now was too early.

The only really fun part of the conversation was when he started naming
people he could introduce us to. He had contacts as most of the obvious big
firms, but we had better contacts across the board. Again, that appears to
be an ace in the hole for us, esp. as we come out of the pandemic.

So, more grist for the mill and one guy's take on the world. They're based
in NYC.

All best,
Josh
