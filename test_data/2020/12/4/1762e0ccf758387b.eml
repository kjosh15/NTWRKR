Glad you're doing well. We bounced to Iceland, where COVID is basically
nonexistent, nobody wears a mask, and my kids go to school full time. OTOH,
it's only light from 11-3 and we have four feet of snow. So, tradeoffs.

Good news is if you can stay alive until summer the world seems likely to
shift on a dime again, and there should be some crazy new opportunity. Hope
we can run into each other again then!! As ever, let me know if I can be of
any help.

All best,
Josh
