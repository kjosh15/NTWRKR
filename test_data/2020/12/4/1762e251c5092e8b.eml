arting at the left and moving to the right the columns are numbered below w=
ith their messages.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1.=C2=A0 The many tears shed by so many people signifying the deep pai=
n they feel.<br>
&gt; 2.=C2=A0 The Red Cross is a long time symbol representing the medical =
aid given to the many suffering from the virus.<br>
&gt; 3.=C2=A0 The time we now live in is so confusing like the people in th=
