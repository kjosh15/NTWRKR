Dear Nexus alum/alumna,


Please click the link below for special edition of the Nexus this week, we =
covered various topics with Nigel Farage - the former leader of UKIP who, p=
erhaps more than anyone else, is responsible for Britain leaving the Europe=
an Union.


He played a prominent role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, which his side wo=
n, and then promptly resigned as leader of UKIP, declaring he wanted his li=
fe back. Since that historic day Mr Farage has been anything but shy and re=
tiring: he soon became a friend and ally to Donald Trump, later he set up a=
 new =93Brexit Party=94 and just last month he relaunched it as =93Reform U=
K=94 to refocus his efforts on resisting what he calls the UK government=92=
s =93woeful=94 response to the Coronavirus pandemic - including =93unspeaka=
bly cruel=94 lockdowns.
