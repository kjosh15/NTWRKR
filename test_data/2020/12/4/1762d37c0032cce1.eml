Thank you SO SO much for inviting me to listen to Dr. Ming yesterday. It
was extraordinarily encouraging to hear about her work and the impact we
can create with technology.

I'd love to talk to her - period - but especially about D&I measurement,
her goals for the group, and her take on the right tools for the job. So
many pitfalls to avoid, so much opportunity to create! Am I recalling
correctly that she's working with you on a framework?

Let me know if we can set up a followup call; I'd love to hear more about
your next steps, where you stand with measurement, and how I could help the
group.

All best,
Josh
