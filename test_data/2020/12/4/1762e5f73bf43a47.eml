Sorry to hear about COVID, and glad you and Laura are doing well!! Sending
all best wishes to the whole family.

Iceland has been really healing; we moved to a big farmhouse outside of
town, with a wood burning stove, horses, sheep, a forest - the whole works.
Oh, and a fiber internet connection. ;)

On the whole it's been really good; the kids go to school, I work on my
startup (which may be going for a raise, in case you ever feel like giving
me your seasoned advice!), and we process having left NYC for vacation and
not returning. Recently we've had a lot of snow and I've been chopping a
lot of firewood. It's simple.

Take good care and let me know if I can ever be of help or if you'd like to
connect.

All best,
Josh
