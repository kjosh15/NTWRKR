Hey there! Kudos/congrats/mazel tov on Iceland (home of my favorite =
COVID study and homeland of my favorite preschool teacher ;-)

We are loving Boulder and feel super-fortunate to be here. We happen to =
have COVID right now (me and Laura, mild symptoms, kids nothing) so =
it=E2=80=99s a difficult time in what otherwise has been a relatively =
non-stressful experience. Schoolwise we=E2=80=99ve stood up our own =
learning pod on our property: =
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vTvsQ2zXCj21IAkvMPMyZ4i9-ChbycNapG=
VRfjOpvtw/edit#slide=3Did.p

As for Scott, I haven=E2=80=99t spoken to him in a while (perhaps since =
the beginning of COVID) so I don=E2=80=99t know. I spoke to Nick Haan a =
month ago and he=E2=80=99s doing well in Zanzibar. Lopa and I just =
realized we=E2=80=99ve been in Boulder the last couple of years without =
knowing it. Grace just reached out this week to catch up and I=E2=80=99ve =
not had a chance to catch up with her due to the COVID. Keith Watson and =
I are in regular touch.

What=E2=80=99s life like for you guys in Iceland and generally?
