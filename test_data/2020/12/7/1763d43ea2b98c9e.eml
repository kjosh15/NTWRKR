Just read a quick article about Icelandic tourism and they point out that a
lot will depend on Schengen restrictions; i.e., if the EU is allowing US
tourists at all. If not, Iceland is still out. Those restrictions will
depend a lot on how the US handles vaccines, etc. etc.

Altogether I say buy your tickets with a good refund policy and hope! :)

xoxo,
Josh

As for presents, yes that sounds about right to me. Given the shipping cost=
s to Iceland, are you up for playing holiday helper? If I send along some f=
unds perhaps you can get some treats on my behalf to put under the tree? Or=
 if you have local companies you
 recommend that I could shop at online, or if I&#39;m wrong about the shipp=

Also, for the sake of transparency, I&#39;m feeling conflicted about not in=

Anyhow, as you know I tend to handle all my holiday gift needs by the end o=

I like the idea of keeping our expenses reasonable, but I think given the y=
ear we&#39;ve had; a little extra holiday cheer is in order. I&#39;m even p=
utting up a tree for the first time in years! I know that shipping to Icela=
nd isn&#39;t cheap, so maybe there&#39;s a workaround
 you can recommend? I still don&#39;t have your address out there, so if I =
could get that I&#39;d like to send something personal even if it&#39;s jus=
