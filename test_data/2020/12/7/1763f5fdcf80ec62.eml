Hey Josh,

Happy to connect, albeit virtually.

It's always great to meet like-minded people and a Sveinn mentioned if you
ever want to have a chat about life in Iceland, your current projects, what
we're building or a linear combination of all of those ... count me in :)

I see that your domain (josh.is) was registered in 2008 so I'm guessing you
moving here has been brewing for some time now!

Cheers
Gisli

    <p>A well known Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Balaji Srinivasan,
      recently claimed that fiat currency is a scam. <br>
    </p>
    Monerium&#39;s not-so-secret secret mission is to fix fiat - or at leas=
t
    improve it significantly - by using blockchains to remove
    intermediaries in mainstream commercial transactions. <br>
    <p>Towards that end, we became the first company authorized to issue
      e-money on blockchains. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Which is a Big Deal because the EU just announced a proposal for
