Hi! yes, last  call was great!
Here is the list of questions I have:
-Moldy bath ducks? keep or toss?
-do you still like the suction shelve in the bathroom to be delivered?
-has the packing list changed since you were planning to store all of your
belongings in storage and come back? and if so can you update it please?
-stuff animals? to go? i don't see them on the packing list.

as per our last conversation:
there are 6 packed boxes all from kids room. I can still pack another one
thats would make 7 boxes plus 1 more the "2nd shipment box".  I also left
you a whatsapp VM.

I got a package that arrived for Hulda with clothes, the tape, boxes and
adapters. your shoes are on their way.
Also there are some items that won't fit on the boxes that we currently
have so I am thinking we need about 3 boxes that are this big, 75cm x 4cm.
