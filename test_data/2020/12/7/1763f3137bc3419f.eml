Hey Josh,

I'm sorry for the delay.  As I'm sure you have done your research, the main
questions are:

   1. Where are you living and how long you intend to stay?
   2. Where is your permanent residence?  You should be filing wherever
   your permanent residence is.
   3. Do you intend on coming back to NY/NYC?


I can help you file either way you chose to go.  I do think that filing as
NYC for 2020 will probably be the easiest/cleanest but will Iceland have a
problem with that?  I also think NY/NYC may give you an issue if you choose
to go the Iceland route since a lot of people moved out of NYC
temporarily during covid so they will be looking to see who comes back and
try to audit you if you come back.

Stephanie
