Yes, greenlight that show & get to warmer climes before the winter *really*
sets in!!

I am aiming to have the site ready by the end of the week, at which point I
will absolutely send it your way. (I'll also be looking for any feedback on
the positioning, if any ideas come to you).
I'll be thinking through the right monetization strategy over the next few
weeks, so late January could be the right time to really dig into the
specifics with you. I know that this is an idea (monetize a personal
network) that you;ve been thinking about, and I'm starting to piece it
together.

I hope you are staying warm & enjoying the landscape. I'll reach back out
once the website is up & running.
Until then, enjoy your week!

Best,
Casey
