Got to get the show greenlit, first! It's all Iceland until then...

Will happily suggest you to companies that ask; let me know when you have a
website to point to. Similarly, I may loop back around in Q1 to ask about
how you see monetizing the network; at present I'm negotiating a couple
consulting gigs but think you may be on to something. Keep me posted;
always happy to help!

All best,
Josh
