Hey Josh, and hi Matt,

I'm really just spread too thin to be of any help to Matt. My name is on so
many documentary and series projects looking for funding (maybe 15) that I
fear I'm not doing anyone any good. And I'm just so busy with my own work,
I can't even fit another Zoom all in until mid January.

The project looks great though, and I'm sure it will be supported and do
great.

I'm doing my best to keep on keeping on, but I've really painted myself
into a corner with commitments. I'm spending the majority of the rest of
this year getting out of stuff, so that I get some time back to actually do
something constructive. Glad to hear you are in Iceland which, I imagine,
is relatively safer for you and yourn. America is just the pits. :(

More soon. I do think of you often.
Douglas
