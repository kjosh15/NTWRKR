Dear Investors & Advisors.
It=E2=80=99s been an interesting and tough year, to say the least. But thro=
ugh all of
the challenges, we have achieved a significant number of major milestones t=
hat
even in a normal, non-pandemic, non-economic crisis, non-social injustice f=
illed
year we should all be extremely proud of.
So, first and foremost Martin and I would like to thank our Shortlist team
members and their families. Their commitment during likely one of the harde=
st
and most uncertain years any of us have been through personally is humbling=
 and
we could not be more proud of each of their contributions. We went into thi=
s
year with a smaller team with more work to be done - believing that they we=
re
the best and right people to achieve what was ahead of us. We leave this ye=
ar
amazed at how they've worked together to make the right decisions at the ri=
ght
time, under the most daunting of circumstances all while ensuring that we l=
ived
our Family First culture. We=E2=80=99ve seen them go out of their way to de=
liver amazing
new features, to deliver exceptional customer service all while being
compassionate and considerate of their teammates and customers in need of
support.

It would be easy to mistake our success this year as Martin and I being goo=
d
leaders. That simply isn=E2=80=99t the case. Each of our team members has s=
hown
tremendous leadership capabilities throughout the year including discussing=
,
debating, and deciding on the right course of action with their fellow
Shortlisters. For this, Martin and I are extremely grateful.=20
There have also been personal hurdles to overcome with COVID including both
sickness and death. Our hearts continue to go out to those who have lost lo=
ved
ones and we continue to send positive energy for healing from illness and f=
rom
grief. We also ask that our=C2=A0employees continue to place their families=
 first,
doing whatever they can and whatever is needed to ensure the safety and hea=
lth
of their loved ones.=20
To our investors and advisors, we also have a sincere amount of gratitude. =
Your
support this year and in previous years has helped us make Shortlist what i=
t is
today. A profitable, growing business that has been able to outflank our
competitors, stay just ahead of the curve, and to be a leader in the space
trusted by hundreds of global companies and their legions of nearly 200,000
talent who help to ensure their own business success.
Shortlist has proven itself as a mission-critical platform and a valued and
trusted partner across industries, company sizes, and the world. Without th=
e
financial support and advice of you, our investor/advisor community - the r=
oad
here would have certainly been harder and perhaps even impossible. Our grat=
itude
to you will be shown through our continued commitment to listening to your
advice and being strong fiduciary stewards. The trust you=E2=80=99ve placed=
 in us thus
far energizes us as we look into the future.=20
It would be easy to look back on 2020 and say it was simply too difficult t=
o
want to remember every thing  that happened. However, we believe that throu=
gh
some of the darkest moments the brightest of lights are able to shine throu=
gh.
We choose to focus on those bright lights at this time and allow them to le=
ad us
into the year ahead. The positivity and laughter of our teammates in uncert=
ain
and scary times. The creativity and ingenuity of our teammates, leveraging =
the
cards dealt them to create the best possible solutions. The focus on family=
,
supporting, and giving to others in need. And most of all, the belief that
tomorrow will be a better day and that makes today worth fighting through.=
=20


Our holiday imagery this year represents the challenges and obstacles we=E2=
=80=99ve
climbed together as a team. Each light on the Christmas tree represents a
Shortlist team member, bound to the next to ensure that the chain is unbrok=
en
and the support for one another leads us all to the top and the best that w=
e can
be. At the top, our team holding the star, which represents a bright future=
, is
led by three cross-functional star players Zoe Merkle, Srishti Chatterjee, =
and
Adam Robak.
While the team has performed some miracles throughout the year, I=E2=80=99d=
 like to take
a moment to share a few key highlights that we are all very proud of. All o=
f
these accomplishments are the making of the entire team and not just one
individual.  * First and foremost our first profitable, month, then quarter=
(s) and now
   (projected) year.
 * Key wins of huge logos including Disney, The Home Depot, Netflix,
   CDW, Politico to name just a few.
 * Sales growth that outperformed our post-Covid forecast setting us
   up to pass out  ARR target of 2.5m and total revenue target of 2m.
 * The rebuilding of our Payments Platform including the Product and
   Service Operations, allowing us to more than double payment transaction
   volume, more than double payment volume and revenue, and most importantl=
y
   setting this service line up for even greater success in 2020.
 * There too  many Product wins to count but the rebuilding and enhancement=
s to
   Workflows and addition of new VMS functionality are standouts along with
   significant major improvements across the Platform.
 * Shortlist in 2020 has been ranked at the top right corner of
   every key analyst in the space including SIA, SpendMatters, Ardent Partn=
ers,
   and Talent Tech Labs.
 * A pipeline full of quality deals for December and the start of
   2021 including names like Vox Media, Fandom, LendingTree, Chime, Equity
   Residential, etc.
 * Several good (but not quite good enough to take...) offers for
   the business showing the potential that strategic players see in what we=
 are
   building.
 * And most importantly more than 200 customers are continually
   placing their trust in us and expanding their use of the Platform and ou=
r
   Services to grow their own businesses. Notable expansions this year incl=
ude
   names like Microsoft, Disney, ITN, and Ferguson.

Again, there were so many bright lights throughout the year but these were =
a few
of the highlights.=20
For those of you looking to understand our performance for November
specifically, I=E2=80=99ve shared the Monthly Business Review  as usual.  *=
 For the 5th
   straight month, November continued our trend of outperforming our revise=
d
   post-COVID revenue forecast in terms of ARR, ending the month at $200.13=
k=20
   MRR, or=C2=A0growth of 6%.
 * This growth
   level continues to be in line with our pre-COVID growth rates
 * New
   activations were down, but both expansions and deal size continue to
   increase, which are both positive indicators.
 * We delivered
   a profit of $66k, out-performing our forecasted loss and last month's $5=
1.2k.
    Note that we had not anticipated achieving profitability until this mon=
th.
 * Payments and
   OTR are more than double October at $126.16k=C2=A0which was due in part =
to timing
   of some billing activities.
 * Cash on Hand
   remains strong at $798k.
 * Year to
   date, Shortlist has delivered a profit of $232.3k.
  =20

Inthis month's update,=C2=A0you'll see the following: * Key KPIs
 * Key Positive Trends
 * Current Month=C2=A0+ Trailing
   Three Month Performance
 * Churn / Contraction Overview
 * Forecast vs. Actual
  =20
 * Pipeline Highlights
 * Personnel Changes
  =20
 * Product Update / Highlights

Shortlist Business Update for November 2020
I=E2=80=99ll end this year's last monthly business update as I started, wit=
h gratitude.
Martin and I are so very grateful for each and every Shortlist team member'=
s
commitment and for their family's support. We believe that while 2020 has b=
een a
success for the year - against the odds - that their talent and determinati=
on
will make 2021 a year with even more major milestones and accomplishments
personally and professionally.=20
We wish all of you a safe and healthy holiday season with your loved ones
whether close or far away. We also want to say that we hope 2021 brings gre=
at
things to all of you including the end to the COVID pandemic and a return t=
o
normalcy with the recent vaccines, a year filled with significantly more ho=
pe
and love than hate, and a year that shows what we as individuals, as a team=
, and
as humans can do if we believe in ourselves and work to be our best selves.=
=20
Best Holiday Wishes,
Martin and Joey.

        <div>
         It=E2=80=99s been an interesting and tough year, to say the least.=
 But through all of the challenges, we have achieved a significant number o=
f major milestones that even in a normal, non-pandemic, non-economic crisis=
, non-social injustice filled year we should all be extremely proud of.

        <div>
         So, first and foremost Martin and I would like to thank our Shortl=
ist team members and their families. Their commitment during likely one of =
the hardest and most uncertain years any of us have been through personally=
 is humbling and we could not be more proud of each of their contributions.=
 We went into this year with a smaller team with more work to be done - bel=
ieving that they were the best and right people to achieve what was ahead o=
f us. We leave this year amazed at how they've worked together to make the =
right decisions at the right time, under the most daunting of circumstances=
 all while ensuring that we lived our Family First culture. We=E2=80=99ve s=
een them go out of their way to deliver amazing new features, to deliver ex=
ceptional customer service all while being compassionate and considerate of=
 their teammates and customers in need of support.
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         It would be easy to mistake our success this year as Martin and I =
being good leaders. That simply isn=E2=80=99t the case. Each of our team me=
mbers has shown tremendous leadership capabilities throughout the year incl=
uding discussing, debating, and deciding on the right course of action with=
 their fellow Shortlisters. For this, Martin and I are extremely grateful.=

        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         There have also been personal hurdles to overcome with COVID inclu=
ding both sickness and death. Our hearts continue to go out to those who ha=
ve lost loved ones and we continue to send positive energy for healing from=
 illness and from grief. We also ask that our&nbsp;employees continue to pl=
ace their families first, doing whatever they can and whatever is needed to=
 ensure the safety and health of their loved ones.=20
        </div>
        <div>
         <br>
        </div>
        <div>
         To our investors and advisors, we also have a sincere amount of gr=
atitude. Your support this year and in previous years has helped us make Sh=
ortlist what it is today. A profitable, growing business that has been able=
 to outflank our competitors, stay just ahead of the curve, and to be a lea=
der in the space trusted by hundreds of global companies and their legions =
of nearly 200,000 talent who help to ensure their own business success.

         Shortlist has proven itself as a mission-critical platform and a v=
alued and trusted partner across industries, company sizes, and the world. =
Without the financial support and advice of you, our investor/advisor commu=
nity - the road here would have certainly been harder and perhaps even impo=
ssible. Our gratitude to you will be shown through our continued commitment=
 to listening to your advice and being strong fiduciary stewards. The trust=
 you=E2=80=99ve placed in us thus far energizes us as we look into the futu=
re.=20
