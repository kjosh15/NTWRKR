Merry Christmas!

First off, here's the power article I'm working on. See if you think you'll
be happy with where I'm going:

http://thecrowbox.com/wiki/doku.php?id=kit:portable_power

I'm still writing and editing, but it's good enough for you to get a
thumbnail view. I'd like to be in a position to post this either this
weekend or early next week.


So, Voltaic has revamped their entire product line since I tested their
power bank. They still proudly advertise their "Always On" power banks, so
that's good for us. They understand they have customers with Time-Lapse
Photography, IoT, and other low-energy projects like ours.

They have a good deal on this solar get-up:

https://voltaicsystems.com/2-watt-kit/

For 60 bones you get a 2 watt solar panel and a 6,400mAh power bank. It
still takes one more part (a USB breakout cable) to easily connect this to
a Crowbox. But, for under $70 you get an always on power bank with decent
capacity and a 2W solar panel designed to work with that power bank, along
with the other cable needed to attach it to a Crowbox. I don't know if this
comes out to be less money than the piecemeal solar setup posted by that
one user but it's sure as fuck easier.

Even if the solar panel only practically nets 1 watt, or even 1/2 watt, it
should still power a Crowbox indefinitely. 6,400 mAh would run a Crowbox
for five days with NO solar panel, so the bank should be up to the task of
keeping a box running during poor solar output.

The Crowbox uses 47mA, or .245 watts.

So even if the solar panel only delivered 1/2 watt of power, it's still
double what the Crowbox is consuming.

I ordered one of these kits so I could give it a go. Our days are short and
cold, nights long and colder, but the days tend to be fairly sunny but
cloudy a few times a week. So these are pretty realistic as a set of
adverse conditions so I think I'll do some testing on this configuration
purely to determine whether a Crowbox can be kept running constantly this
way.

In other news, I've decided to make videos demonstrating the process of
connecting either a USB power bank or a 12V power source to a Crowbox.
There's so much interest in this topic that it just makes good sense to
document it for people, and a video will be much more effective than text.
I ordered a couple of parts that I need for this so maybe I can shoot these
next week.

-Steve
