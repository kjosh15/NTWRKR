It has truly has been an odd bookend year. Where I thought I=E2=80=99d =
be and where I am now. So many plans for 2020, so many of them dropped. =
Such a huge change in the way that I practice and oh, our New York life, =
where did it go? But I also had been trying to slow down , and had been =
successful to a point. And although I=E2=80=99d never want to benefit =
off of anybody else's uncompensated sweat and sorrows, as this year in =
particular I realized that we unwilling and unknowingly do more often =
than not, this slow down has been so beneficial to me and only in the =
last week have  realized the value of this new pace in life.
I am deeply grateful for our friendship.=20

The only book that I=E2=80=99ve ever read is the Way of the Shaman. =
After our last two talks, I did wish so much for you to have some =
experience group training, not just for the organized skills but also =
because of they of journeying with a group. https://shamanism.org. Yes, =
context. I have no idea what it would be like online, but there is such =
great information. I know Nan Moss the best.  I tried to find some basic =
in person workshops in Iceland, but they seem odd and long. Regardless, =
lets try and do a journey for our next time together. That=E2=80=99s the =
easiest way for me to share with you what I know.=20

The question:
No yes or no
Try not to ask a when. If you ask a rock when, it may say soon and mean =
100 years.=20
There=E2=80=99s a perfect blend of vague and specific.=20
-what can I do now to improve my health?
What signposts could I be paying attention next week to get joy out of =
(x) experience.=20

I=E2=80=99ll reread the way of the shaman before we chat. I think that =
that will help too.=20

Funny, I=E2=80=99ve been writing this over the last 40 min and its not =
fully linear. Almost as if we=E2=80=99re chatting.=20
