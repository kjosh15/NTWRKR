I forgot to say thank you for all the hard work and assembling all the 
info, and the math. And the testing.
I wonder, since I have a solar panel already rigged, if I can split it to 
go to both the camera AND the powerbank. This assumes that the camera will 
pull the power it needs, and the powerbank will pull what it needs. I don't 
think it will work that way since it will send basically half to each. 
Maybe a single panel rated for both would work, but then I might as well 
just get a single one for the powerbank.

Just thinking out loud.
