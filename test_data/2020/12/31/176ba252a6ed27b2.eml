I used a Reolink Argus PT w/ Solar Panel
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W6PXRR8/

I love everything about how this thing functions as a camera for what I 
need. But...
I have to add the disclaimer that there is a bit of delay. It sits in 
"power-save" mode until the PIR senses activity. Then it has to wake up, 
and then it snaps a picture. This delay is only like 0.75 of a second, but 
it is enough for whatever subject tripped the PIR to disappear from the 
screen. So I would get tons of pictures with nothing, because a squirrel 
did a drive-by nut-grab.

I'm going to try a stupid fast microSD card which will capture video 
snippets which may make me feel better about this.
