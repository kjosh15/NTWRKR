if the box took a tumble things like the electronics enclosure and coin=20

existing iterations.

I think one aspect I'd improve on in later iterations on the design is in=

and after building this out, it actually makes more sense that they'd be=20

v><div><br></div><div>Modular concepts, where various subassemblies are int=
ended to be capable of being swapped out. This comes down to four primary s=
ubassembly divisions:</div><div><br></div><div>- The housing subassembly - =
the primary box that everything fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid subassem=
bly - the sliding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit switches, and coi=
n magazine</div><div>- The basket subassembly - the face plate and basket t=
hat slots onto the housing subassembly</div><div>- The electronics subassem=
bly - weather resistant box for the the Arduino</div><div><br></div><div>Th=
ese subassemblies are separated into their component concepts so they can b=
e replaced or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and basket subas=
semblies aren=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subassembly.=
 They interlock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pins, and=
 can be removed fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue them in pl=
ace, you absolutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replaced to al=
low smaller/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance, I=
=E2=80=99m going to be replacing colors and swapping between my two box pla=
cements periodically to see if different colors (or transparency) perform d=
ifferently. This aspect of the design removes the need to have any access p=
anels.</div><div><br></div><div>Other parts of the design have similar inte=
rlocking concepts. This is notable in the assembly steps of the basket, as =
pieces are slotted in from the back of the face plate. The basket ribs are =
then slid into position and things are bolted together, which creates a coh=
esive and stable subassembly that can then be glued more easily with minima=
l effort in holding / getting things aligned properly. I may post a couple =
photos/videos of this on my final build, because the order of operations ma=
tters a bit here.</div><div><br></div><div>Better weathering potential. Dra=
inage holes have been added to the corners of the bottom panel that allow m=
oisture to drain (regardless of level / lean orientation). The electronics =
subassembly allows better whatever level of weatherizing you feel is needed=
. I personally have only built the box and then rubber banded one of the pa=
nels in place, so I can still easily access the electronics, but since the =
subassembly is designed to keep a gap between the inner walls of the housin=
g subassembly it means less water will be touching the surfaces that the el=
ectronics are mounted to.</div><div><br></div><div>The basket volume has in=
creased by some ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, but th=
e basket depth has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding lid ha=
s 1cm more travel, and is a little more than 2cm wider.=C2=A0 That, and oth=
er design tweaks to the basket increase the volume for food, and reduce the=
 area that scraps or other material can accidentally fall it into the coin =
delivery areas. This may have an impact on accidental coin activations, but=
 that&#39;s something I plan on running an experiment on -- in this version=
 I actually just wanted to increase volume and will run some tests on diffe=
rent aspects of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout and placement of =
parts is optimized to get everything onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=
=E2=80=9D x 15.1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color parts, and the transparent parts=
 can be doubled up on a single sheet of the same dimensions. This allows or=
dering two color sheets and a single (doubled up design) transparent sheet.=
 So two crowboxes, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I know some laser cutters w=
on=E2=80=99t be able to accommodate that size, but I optimized for what was=
 immediately at hand during the pandemic, and that was the capabilities of =
Ponoko.</div><div><br></div><div>Transparent part usage was reduced in the =
housing subassembly, which means the housing is fully opaque when using an =
opaque acrylic (no transparent parts come through from the back to the fron=
t except for the lid). The logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/lig=
ht or movement could unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one si=
de of the housing to the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom panel h=
as some holes for drainage, and also a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D=
 of slots that sensors or subhousings can utilize in future revisions or it=
erations. For instance, the coin sensor uses this interface, as does the el=
ectronics subassembly, and each can be mirrored to use the right or left si=
de depending on build or deployment concerns. A similar concept is availabl=
e on the bottom of the rails (to hang things from), but that=E2=80=99s not =
being utilized in these designs.</div><div><br></div><div>The coin magazine=
 has more capacity, and is designed to allow more flexibility in movement (=
in that it=E2=80=99s not glued to the lid), which makes jamming less likely=
 (potentially even when using non U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now sl=
ots into position, so placement doesn&#39;t require measuring and gluing. I=
t&#39;s held in position between the lid and the perch platform using a pie=
ce of styrene without needing to glue it in place.</div><div><br></div><div=
>There=E2=80=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs, bu=
t you=E2=80=99re welcome to hot glue the subassemblies together since it=E2=
=80=99s fairly trivial to remove and might minimize rattling and other nois=

nuts/bolts/washers=C2=A0(this would allow for minor versions -- v2.0 -&gt; =
v2.1 could be only adjustments to the the basket subassembly, or changes to=
 improve the base subassembly independently, or testing different material =
/ color options)</li><li>Switch to metric for everything (I see inches in s=
ome places, and even as an American I don&#39;t want to anymore, haha)</li>=
<li>Migrate to using a single limit switch in the back of the machine by th=
e perch hook (is there a redundancy reason for the two limit switches that =
I&#39;m missing maybe?)</li><li>Remove the perch hook and include it into t=
he shape of the perch platform</li><li>Find and utilize a standard adapter =
measurement for the base reinforcing ring / bolt holes in base panel (for t=

embly - Step 2 video, a couple nuts are hot glued to the inside, but we sho=
uld provide pieces like the included hex wrenches that can be glued in plac=
es with the washer/bolt -- this would also be part of idea 3)</li><li>Provi=
de water resistant housing alternative to the sled (I&#39;d also like for t=
his to better fit on the shelves / slide in out / potentially be oriented v=
ertically on the rear panel instead of horizontally and removing the front =
sled shelf)</li><li>Remove the need for the soldering iron and related step=
s (I don&#39;t think we need to solder to the limit switch(es) or the allig=
ator clips, crimping things should be enough for solid contact, even in wea=
thering conditions, right?)</li></ol>Here&#39;s a couple questions for you =
Josh. How concerned are we in terms of cost associated with the housing bui=
ld? I don&#39;t plan on making it super expensive or anything, but it may b=
e worth having some priorities for which things I can/we optimize towards?<=
br><div><br></div><div>Like, build quality/durability, simplicity of build,=
 simplicity in ordering, cost of build, flexibility in versioning / color o=
ptions (I want to do this purely so I can test different colors), flexibili=
ty in options (for instance, the housing alternative to the sled), etc.</di=
v></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again! It&#39;s been really enjoyable to=
 work on the crowbox so far, and if I can, I&#39;d be happy to help out in =
other ways too. I&#39;m a software engineer, and am interested in discussin=
g the code / hardware as well -- including a raspberry pi implementation, b=
ut that&#39;s an entirely different topic and one I haven&#39;t dived into =
fully yet.</div>
