You'll have to try much harder than that to insult me, especially if it's
just because you don't feel like celebrating the most marketed holiday on
earth!! I've got a few lines I don't like to cross (mostly around rape and
pedofilia) but avoiding christmas? That, my friend, only makes you more
interesting. ;)

Similarly, a decade or so ago =E2=80=9Cmoments of being=E2=80=9D might have=
 seen
unnecessarily woo-woo, but a lot has changed since then. Now I consider
your approach laudable; it appears to me to be a search for meaning, and a
well considered one at that, as opposed to a thoughtless or unreflected
commitment to a passing sensation otherwise handed to you without
experience or personal reference. I look forward to learning more!

Very excited to hear more about this; it reflects something I've found
myself brushing up against but unable to describe; a sensation of quality
or ineffable elevation of experience embodied, unusually, in the physical.
Not sure if that's where you're headed, but I think it's described by
better minds than mine - Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance, to
reference your high school reading list, and, again, in Pattern Recognition
by Gibson.

Looking forward to our next convo, before which I'd request we set our
calls to be ongoing after the holidays (which are, due to my own
scheduling, a bit packed) - if that suits you!

All best,
Josh
