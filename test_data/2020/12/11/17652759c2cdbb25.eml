It's hard to be nonspecific and abstract enough to appeal broadly!!

To answer your question of past Signal exchanges: yes this is a broadly
sent email missive, but you were caught up in it by accident and I had
thought I'd ganked you from the thread. Longer conversation on the goals
(which have been, oddly, pretty successfully met) and processes is due!

Apologies,
Josh
