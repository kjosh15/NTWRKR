YES PLZ. Fully agree, but would extend this:

Once we have a single cohesive view, and are able to pull out subset views
(around D&I, ESG, etc.), we can then algorithmically "migrate" action
statements oriented toward the subset views into the primary frame.

This has the effect of over time adjusting employee's view of "ideal
behaviors" to be more in line with subset values through the use of social
proof and reframing (reviewing and being reviewed by peers). I.e., it
autonomously identifies where your employee behaviors are weakest, and
automatically migrates them to be stronger. Yes?

And who is Ian Wilson again?
