Great talking to you both today; please do send me your materials - I'm
excited to dig in! If you're amenable, I'll schedule a followup call to
preview who I'd like to send them to once I've had a chance to go through
them to make sure that's in line with where you're headed.

All best,
Josh

                        Monerium&#39;s not-so-secret secret mission is to
                        fix fiat - or at least improve it significantly
                        - by using blockchains to remove intermediaries
                        in mainstream commercial transactions. <br>
                        <p>Towards that end, we became the first company
                          authorized to issue e-money on blockchains. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which is a Big Deal because the EU just
                          announced a proposal for Markets in Crypto
                          Assets which stipulates that all &quot;stablecoin=
s&quot;
                          in Europe should be licensed as e-money. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Instead of tweeting epithets, we lobby
                          central banks in public and behind the scenes
                          for ways to &quot;flatten finance&quot; <br>

                        <p>And we just finished closed beta and are
                          preparing to scale, building a business to
                          help bring &quot;defi&quot; mainstream. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Happy to tell you more in person or online
                          and hear what brings you to Iceland. <br>
