Gustavo,

Thanks for the call today! I appreciate you couldn't speak totally
transparently with your son there. I didn't want to ask too much as a
result, but I understood that you may be able to leave NYC for up to 6
months of the year and should know more by the 22nd.

I think our concerns are that we get everything packed up and shipped and
have time in January to sell off anything left over if you're leaving. Can
you help me understand what exactly you anticipate having clarity on by the
22nd?

Additionally, we need to move the utilities over. Everything I read online
indicated that utilities should be notified 2-4 weeks before you move out,
but when I went to ConEd, Nat. Grid, and Spectrum's sites it looked like we
could cancel as late as a week before. Is there a reason you want to wait
until the 22nd to move these over to your name?

In the meantime, you're going to pack the english books and the stuff we
ordered into another box + the legos box for a total of 4-5 boxes
(including the 2nd Shipment box and the box of kids clothes).

Can you send a picture of the two plastic wrapped bags of clothing in the
cabinet in the living room so we can decide if they're needed?

Finally, I'm waiting to find out if all the boxes can be picked up tomorrow
before 1pm.

Onward!
Josh
