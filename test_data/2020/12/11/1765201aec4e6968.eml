Updated attached.

4. This graph still looks like ass. Is there anything you can do on your
end to shoot for a wider view?

6. Send me this graph when you get it.

8. I switched "code himself" to "develop" b/c it saying "we coded it
ourself" feels amateurish. Claiming it's developed in-house is valuable,
but only inasmuch as we take it as an obvious outcome of our capabilities.
I.e., your bio spells this out. Otherwise agree with you about the logic
and am happy to amplify this elsewhere/differently - any ideas?

9. Does this slide feel strong? I ask as I got pushback from an investor
yesterday about our valuation - i.e., a 20mm valuation on $500k of income
is too aggressive and not worth $3mm investment (was his opinion). Just
wondering if there's anything else we can show here that dresses things up
a little, such as expected inbound deals, etc.

10. I hear you about the issues here, and agree that one of our strengths
is that we've derisked the investment. However, that is not (AFAIK) a
feature to VCs. Risk is expected; it's the opportunity they're eager to
have explained to them. Put another way, the fact that we've got a solid
and derisked opportunity with signed customers and product, vision, staff,
management expertise, market size etc. doesn't flip any of the bits I'm
hearing are indicators as being appealing as an investment.

Not trying to be pedantic here - perhaps it's just a matter of shopping it
around enough to find the investor who's aligned - but in the meantime
these seem like the most popular claims to make the funding ask against.

 me? Similarly, are you comfortable with us asking any of our new(er) clien=

we need to show.<br><br>7. Data on market size; both a graph and/or some ex=
amples would be very helpful.<br><br>8. Is this traction data correct, and =
can you think of anything to supplement?<br><br>9. This is bombastic as fuc=
