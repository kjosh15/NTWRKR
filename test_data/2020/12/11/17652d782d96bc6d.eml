Josh,

Great talking to you likewise!

I am about to send an invite to a Google Drive folder with summary and 
deck, for your eyes only please.

It'd be great to talk again when you've had time to digest.

Incidentally, I looked up David Friedman, according  Wikipedia he is 
Patri's father, and David's website has an article about Iceland's 
constitution in the commonwealth era.

Modern Iceland has evolved since libertarian days of the Viking 
settlers, but at Monerium we are effectively building a "narrow bank" 
for blockchains inspired by the ideas of several well-known economists, 
including Milton Friedman.

And this is by using an established framework for financial services in 
major jurisdiction, e-money in the EU.

Which could help displace the current To-Big-To-Fail banks and make the 
financial system more efficient and less risky.

As you also mentioned, small and medium sized banks should be in favor 
of a more decentralized approach to finance.

Look forward to talking again at your convenience.

All the best,

Sveinn

    <p>And this is by using an established framework for financial
      services in major jurisdiction, e-money in the EU. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Which could help displace the current To-Big-To-Fail banks and
      make the financial system more efficient and less risky. <br>

    <p>As you also mentioned, small and medium sized banks should be in

                                      <p>Josh, good to meet you, welcome
                                        to the Warm Island of the North.</p>
                                      <p>A well known Silicon Valley
                                        entrepreneur, Balaji Srinivasan,
                                        recently claimed that fiat
                                        currency is a scam. <br>
                                      </p>
                                      Monerium's not-so-secret secret
                                      mission is to fix fiat - or at
                                      least improve it significantly -
                                      by using blockchains to remove
                                      intermediaries in mainstream
                                      commercial transactions. <br>
                                      <p>Towards that end, we became the
                                        first company authorized to
                                        issue e-money on blockchains. <br>
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Which is a Big Deal because the
                                        EU just announced a proposal for
                                        Markets in Crypto Assets which
                                        stipulates that all
                                        "stablecoins" in Europe should
                                        be licensed as e-money. <br>
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Instead of tweeting epithets,
                                        we lobby central banks in public
                                        and behind the scenes for ways
                                        to "flatten finance" <br>
                                      </p>

                                        building a business to help
                                        bring "defi" mainstream. <br>
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Happy to tell you more in
                                        person or online and hear what
                                        brings you to Iceland. <br>
