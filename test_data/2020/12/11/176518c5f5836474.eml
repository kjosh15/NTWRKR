1. The utilities would roll under your name starting Jan 1, but we need to
shift them off our account before then to avoid NY state being able to
claim taxes from us for 2021. Paying rent for Jan puts us at risk for this,
but we've already committed to that to you.

2. Let us know if you can pull a couple boxes of kids books that are in
English.

3. Right now we're looking at shipping:

- 2 boxes of kids' books
- 2 boxes of kids' clothes
- 1 "second shipment" box
- 1 box of legos

We're waiting to hear if FedEx can pick them up at the apartment.

4. Final thing would be to ensure when you can get everything else packed
to ship by sea; given your business trip do you have a revised schedule?

Let us know about the above; talk to you tonight!

- J
