As for holidays, you've hit a pique (maybe even a peak pique).=C2=A0 It too=
k me the first ten years with my in-laws to convince them that I wanted not=
hing to do with anything holiday related.=C2=A0 On Christmas morning, which=
 is the big deal time for them and their children, I take my computer and w=
hatever I am reading to one of the open cafes or bagelries and disappear un=
til dinner.=C2=A0 Because of the lockdown, the list of sanctuaries will be =
shorter this year, but they're out there.=C2=A0 So Bah, Humfuck is my respo=
nse to all things holiday-ish.=C2=A0 As a kind of adjunct, I have friends i=
n different parts of the globe who are curious people and critical thinkers=
, so they enjoy correspondence throughout the year (face-to-face is the pre=
ference, followed by Zoom, followed by e-mail or actual letter) =E2=80=93 b=
ut some do address seasonal changes - one friend is a furniture designer/ma=
ster carpenter who actually hand-makes a =E2=80=9Cwinter=E2=80=9D card for =
about a dozen of us sprinkled around the earth =E2=80=93 another is a copyw=
riter for the FBI/CIA who writes a seasonal short story every year for a se=
lect list.=C2=A0 So I=E2=80=99d welcome your observations about anything th=
at comes to your interesting mind, via e-mail or Zoom or carrier pigeon, bu=
t not if it=E2=80=99s store bought or seasonally clich=C3=A9d.=C2=A0 I=E2=
=80=99m sure having young kids changes your perspective, or if you are reli=
gious, so apologies if my vehemence about an ordained Happy and Merry seems=
 insulting in any way.


You'll have to try much harder than that to insult me, especially if it's j=
ust because you don't feel like celebrating the most marketed holiday on ea=
rth!! I've got a few lines I don't like to cross (mostly around rape and pe=
dofilia) but avoiding christmas? That, my friend, only makes you more inter=
esting. ;)


I also want to add a note about my =E2=80=9Cmoments of being=E2=80=9D comme=
nt at the end of our last Zoom. I don=E2=80=99t want it to seem self-help-i=
sh jargon (with all negative connotations attached), or new-age-ish (same),=
 or woo-woo (I think that=E2=80=99s the technical term).=C2=A0 It=E2=80=99s=
 a somewhat esoteric phrase, penned by Woolf to capture experiences that al=
lowed her to step away momentarily from the fears and doubts and deeply wro=
ught observations that dominated her fiction and her life, a life that led =
unfortunately to a pocketful of stones and a deep dive into a local river.=
=C2=A0 Sometimes I=E2=80=99ve found those moments to be =E2=80=9Ca consumma=
tion devoutly to be wished.=E2=80=9D Because I write stage plays, however, =
and am never more than a few feet away from a collection of poetry or a pie=
ce of fiction, I can perhaps more easily slide off into the grace and eloqu=
ence of a line like that.=C2=A0 I sometimes forget that to one whose mind i=
s normally solving technical problems or dealing with business strategy, a =
poorly timed/chosen digression can seem an unnecessary distraction, or some=
times, given the circumstances, even woo-woo silly.=C2=A0 Since I=E2=80=99v=
e been enjoying our conversations, I=E2=80=99m overloading this paragraph w=
ith explanation (gilding the silly?), just in case you left that last call =
thinking, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t have time for emotional esoterica.=E2=80=
=9D


Similarly, a decade or so ago=C2=A0=E2=80=9Cmoments of being=E2=80=9D might=
 have seen unnecessarily woo-woo, but a lot has changed since then. Now I c=
onsider your approach laudable; it appears to me to be a search for meaning=
, and a well considered one at that, as opposed to a thoughtless or unrefle=
cted commitment to a passing sensation otherwise handed to you without expe=
rience or personal reference. I look forward to learning more!

=C2=A0

Next =E2=80=93 and the provocation for my clarifying paragraph above - you =
said you wanted to talk about my business idea next time, vague though it i=
s.=C2=A0 I=E2=80=99d like to do that.=C2=A0 I=E2=80=99ve been making notes =
for quite a while, trying to wrestle the concept to the floor, but it=E2=80=
=99s still too slippery.=C2=A0 Coming from the world of business (president=
 of an ad agency and owner of my own graphic design firm), and keeping a fo=
ot in that water (my consulting and my reading =E2=80=93 Lean Start Up et a=
l), I think I have a head start, but no regular sounding board.=C2=A0 Let m=
e know when and if.


Very excited to hear more about this; it reflects something I've found myse=
lf brushing up against but unable to describe; a sensation of quality or in=
effable elevation of experience embodied, unusually, in the physical. Not s=
ure if that's where you're headed, but I think it's described by better min=
ds than mine - Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance, to reference your=
 high school reading list, and, again, in Pattern Recognition by Gibson.=C2=
=A0
Looking forward to our next convo, before which I'd request we set our call=
s to be ongoing after the holidays (which are, due to my own scheduling, a =
bit packed) - if that suits you!
All best,
Josh

ven a peak pique).&nbsp; It took me the first ten years with my in-laws to =
convince them that I wanted nothing to do with anything holiday related.&nb=
sp; On Christmas morning, which is the big deal time for them and their chi=
ldren, I take my computer and whatever I am reading to one of the open cafe=
s or bagelries and disappear until dinner.&nbsp; Because of the lockdown, t=
he list of sanctuaries will be shorter this year, but they're out there.&nb=
sp; So Bah, Humfuck is my response to all things holiday-ish.&nbsp; As a ki=
nd of adjunct, I have friends in different parts of the globe who are curio=
us people and critical thinkers, so they enjoy correspondence throughout th=
e year (face-to-face is the preference, followed by Zoom, followed by e-mai=
l or actual letter) =E2=80=93 but some do address seasonal changes - one fr=
iend is a furniture designer/master carpenter who actually hand-makes a =E2=
=80=9Cwinter=E2=80=9D card for about a dozen of us sprinkled around the ear=
th =E2=80=93 another is a copywriter for the FBI/CIA who writes a seasonal =
short story every year for a select list.&nbsp; So I=E2=80=99d welcome your=
 observations about anything that comes to your interesting mind, via e-mai=
l or Zoom or carrier pigeon, but not if it=E2=80=99s store bought or season=
ally clich=C3=A9d.&nbsp; I=E2=80=99m sure having young kids changes your pe=
rspective, or if you are religious, so apologies if my vehemence about an o=
rdained Happy and Merry seems insulting in any way.</span></p></div></div><=

=E2=80=99t want it to seem self-help-ish jargon (with all negative connotat=

y Woolf to capture experiences that allowed her to step away momentarily fr=

fiction and her life, a life that led unfortunately to a pocketful of stone=

 from a collection of poetry or a piece of fiction, I can perhaps more easi=
