Stephanie,

Just hung up w/ Jason Oberholtzer. He said we should talk, and I think we
probably should - it's been a while! Let me know if you have time either
early next week or early in the new year; really looking forward to
catching up and comparing notes on how and where this dynamic past year is
making opportunities arise.

All best wishes,
Josh
