Hi! Yes to tomorrow's call at 1:30 EST.
I am living on Saturday by1:30pm.
I am coming back on December 22nd. This is a business trip that came up
last minute.
I will know about putting utilities under my name by the time I get back.
Does that work?
what remains after the 15 boxes plus stuffed animals, I estimate 16-20 more
boxes.
I won't be able to pack that amount of boxes by the weekend. I have been
trouble-shooting a lot lately. Etukai's school was closed for this whole
week. I have been busy home-schooling and much more.
I won't be able to determine which books are icelandic or in english.
However, most of the books that were packed are icelandic. will clarify
more in our call tomorrow.
-yes one main box with legos and was able to fit other items. that boxed is
not sealed yet.
- Let's talk about other details and problem-solve tomorrow.
You basically have the 5 boxes you would like to be shipped ready to go.
it's more so about which ones. if you want more than 5 thats available to.
it is a 2 man job. and need a bigger car most likely.
talk tomorrow.
