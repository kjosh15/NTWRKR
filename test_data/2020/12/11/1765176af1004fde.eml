Sanjay,

Understood. Curious to hear more!

My calendar is unfortunately completely stacked through the end of the
year; would it be enormously offensive to ask to schedule for early
January? My apologies for not getting something together sooner, but I
think it better to admit defeat and plan for what I can actually commit to!

All best,
Josh
