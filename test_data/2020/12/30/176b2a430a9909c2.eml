my first email, but didn=E2=80=99t do a good job looping you in. Thanks for
reaching out!

And yeah, that=E2=80=99s what I figured in terms of all of it. For whatever=

pass some of the quarantine times.

I=E2=80=99ve been on vacation for a bit, and the next time I=E2=80=99m near=
 a computer I=E2=80=99ll
check out the repo and set mine to be a fork =E2=80=94 or something =E2=80=
=94 not sure how
I=E2=80=99ll configure it but I will.

I=E2=80=99m glad I=E2=80=99ve been able to contribute! Your work was my ins=
piration, so
it=E2=80=99s always nice to give and receive inspiration. :) happy holidays=

Hi Jeremy, notice that Josh is copied on this email.

I'm Steve, the other half of the Crowbox project. I've handled some of the
technical issues and wrote the CrOS software.

I wanted to make you aware of a post I just made in the Crowbox Google
Group, which points out the location of the GitHub repository we made for
the CrOS source code.

You can find the post here:

https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/CrowBoxKit/c/wjr08s2iZXU

Getting this out is a crucial part of the open source process, and
something that Josh and I have wanted to do for a while but so far demand
for this type of information has been low since most users we hear from
just build their Crowbox and move on. You're the first contributor to
actually take on some work to modify and improve the Crowbox, which is the
inspiration we needed to organize and publish a bunch of the information
we've been sitting on. So thank you for getting involved!

Let me know if there's any specific ways we can help further.

-Steve
