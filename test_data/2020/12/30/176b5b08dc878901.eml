Yeah, it's totally sweet. Has heat and A/C, GPS, radio, cameras, etc. It's
hot as shit here in summer and obviously cold as shit in winter so it's
good to have both climate control options. Although most of the stuff I
need the ATV for is winter stuff. In fact I just finished plowing. It's
snowing so much you can't tell anymore, though. But it will keep us from
getting totally buried.

The tug is listed for sale right now:
https://www.yachtworld.com/boats/2018/ranger-tugs-r-29-s-3735611/

I was going to bring it here. We're only like five minutes from a huge
marina on Lake Coeur D'Alene but the winter here is crazy harsh. Everyone
wraps or stores their boats. Also, they drain the lake way down in October
so that it's ready for the huge snow melt in the spring. So many slips just
go dry because they remove so much water. It's just the wrong boat for
here. Pontoon boats and powerboats are what people have. Something you can
pay someone to grab with a forklift and stick into storage from October to
March. The tug is designed for harsh NW weather but it's just not workable
on this particular lake.

We're thinking of taking some of the proceeds (assuming it sells!) to get
an RV. We want to eventually look for a piece of land here with some river
frontage. A cool place to camp and fish and shoot, somewhere within an hour
or two so we can just blow out of here and have a three day weekend
outdoors. We'll see how that plan goes.
