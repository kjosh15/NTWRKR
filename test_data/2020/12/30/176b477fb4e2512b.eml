The lack of voter confidence in our electoral system has to do with the
people - namely politicians - not the software. That said there are plenty
of professionals and other experts who work in elections/politics, like me,
who consider the software deployed in our elections to be abysmal (perhaps
intentionally so - see this Twitter feed <https://twitter.com/jennycohn1>fo=
r
details).

Nearly all the activists I know working on this, including technologists,
are adamant the answer is a solution is a vast increase in use of things
like hand-marked paper ballots, but it's also true you will never get rid
of all the software involved. As such, yes, we are DESPERATE for a more
secure, less corruptible (and less corrupt!) solution that can rapidly and
safely scale.

My suspicion of an open-source solution is from my understanding that an
issue with open-source in general is its openness does it make it easier
for people of ill-will to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. This might
stem from ignorance on my part.

I just thank God they're not mentioning a blockchain solution - no bigger
douchebags around than the guys claiming blockchain can answer all our
election problems in one fell swoop!
