3 hours of sun means a solar panel isn't going to do much at all, I think.
Do you get bright sun? Is that three hours of actual up-over-the-horizon
sun or is that the length of your astronomical day?

If it's 3 hours of clear bright sun, you'll at least stretch the power bank
to run for a week or two.

I was looking around out here and realized that our 7.5 hour astronomical
day probably works out to about 5 hours of actual over-the-horizon sun
given the mountains to the east of us and the tall forest to the west.

I've become super skeptical about the 2 watt panel keeping a box going in
Idaho in the winter time. Summer is a different story- our summers are
incredible. Anyway, I have this cool USB in-line ammeter that I can put
between the solar panel and the power bank to accurately measure how much
energy the panel is outputting. So we'll at least be able to put some real
numbers to the output soon. I'll have an easy time measuring output on a
cloudy day and output on a clear day.

Voltaic issued a tracking number but has not given a package to UPS yet.
But I reckon it will come late this week or early next.

I have to build a set of Crowbox guts this week, a bench model. I don't
have a Crowbox around. I thought I had a sled with guts on it but it hasn't
turned up since the move. I need to do this in order to properly cut my
videos to show everyone how to do the USB and 12V power conversions, then I
can use the same thing to start fooling around with Arduino sleep mode. If
we can get that 47 mA of idle consumption down a bit, it would be a big
help.  Damn that LED that we can't turn off. I think that pulls the 7mA.

There is evidence that sleep mode can get the whole thing under 10mA.
That'd be huge but it's not a claim I'm willing to make publicly yet!

/div><div>If we could rely on the panel to deliver a full watt, a Crowbox w=
ould just keep on running. We&#39;d be generating around 20% more energy th=
an we require.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Note that this doesn&#39;t ac=
count for ANY opening/closing of the Crowbox lid, so we can probably say th=
at this activity could easily eat that extra 20%. Which would mean we&#39;r=

e power bank.</div><div><br></div><div>A 6,400mAh (rated) power bank from V=
oltaic would run a Crowbox for 72 continuous hours on its own. If our panel=

 reserve juice each day. Which would still run a Crowbox for weeks.=C2=A0</=
div><div><br></div><div>So it&#39;s a risk saying that this can be done wit=
h a 2 watt panel UNTIL we know exactly how much energy we are really gettin=

 get some precise output measurements under a couple of different condition=

 to take a razor and cut the trace on the Arduino&#39;s circuit board. Not =
something I&#39;m comfortable pointing out to people.</div><div><br></div><=

 time to do that work. If it could mean users could save money by not requi=

ou get a 2 watt solar panel and a 6,400mAh power bank. It still takes one m=
ore part (a USB breakout cable) to easily connect this to a Crowbox. But, f=
or under $70 you get an always on power bank with decent capacity and a 2W =
solar panel designed to work with that power bank, along with the other cab=
le needed to attach it to a Crowbox. I don&#39;t know if this comes out to =
be less money than the piecemeal solar setup posted by that one user but it=
&#39;s sure as fuck easier.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Even if the sola=
r panel only practically nets 1 watt, or even 1/2 watt, it should still pow=
er a Crowbox indefinitely. 6,400 mAh would run a Crowbox for five days with=
 NO solar panel, so the bank should be up to the task of keeping a box runn=
ing during poor solar output.</div><div><br></div><div>The Crowbox uses 47m=

delivered 1/2 watt of power, it&#39;s still double what the Crowbox is cons=

 it a go. Our days are short and cold, nights long and colder, but the days=
 tend to be fairly sunny but cloudy a=C2=A0few times a week. So these are p=
retty realistic as a set of adverse conditions so I think I&#39;ll do some =
testing on this configuration purely to determine whether a Crowbox can be =
kept running constantly this way.</div><div><br></div><div>In other news, I=
&#39;ve decided to make videos demonstrating the process of connecting eith=
er a USB power bank or a 12V power source to a Crowbox. There&#39;s so much=
 interest in this topic that it just makes good sense to document it for pe=
ople, and a video will be much more effective than text. I ordered a couple=
 of parts that I need for this so maybe I can shoot these next week.</div><=
