Hi Everyone,

I'm writing this holiday message in the interval between Christmas and New
Year's as it's always been a pause for reflection and renewal for me.  Hope
that it reaches you and yours in good health and spirits.  Aptly, as I
began working on it yesterday morning, the sun had just broken through the
clouds after a horrific all night storm that battered the UK with wind and
rain.

As much as I would like to neatly slot our arbitrary New Year as a time to
start over and begin a transition to better times, to put the storm of the
past year behind us, the only real power to make that change is the same
one that just caused the clouds to part.  One thing I am very grateful for
over the past year is feeling the increased presence of that power in my
heart and my bones.  It has proven to be of great help navigating not only
these turbulent times but life in general.  But it has its own rhythm and
its own timetable, and is almost never neat nor predictable.  Getting to
know it better, cultivating its ability to help grow, change and heal, is
much of what my life is all about these days.

The circumstances and details of our family are all fine.  Jess, Lollie and
myself are all healthy and in good spirits, as is their mom Vanessa.  Each
of us is embracing our own individual experience of life as deeply as
possible, which is all that anyone can ask.  The past year, while
different in many respects for each of us, has not been short of special
times,  surprises, and new discoveries.  It has most assuredly been a time
of realizing what matters.  If any of you that we're not in touch with
regularly want to have a chat for details and a mutual catch up, happy to
do that, just drop a line and we can schedule something.

In the meantime wishing you and yours health and peace and renewal, however
you choose to practice them.

Love from all of us,

Ron Jess and Lollie
