Helga, thanks so much for the introduction. (To bcc to spare your inbox!)

GK, pleasure to meet you! If you're willing, I'd be very grateful for a
brief conversation to learn more about Lucinity and to get your take on the
local tech ecosystem. Let me know if you have time in the next couple weeks
to connect.

All best,
Josh
