Appreciate the call earlier; you nailed a lot of my fears and helped me get
direction on my immediate targets to allay them (or discover if that's not
possible!) An intro to Upturn would be highly appreciated. Does the
following work?

Josh is working on a platform that uses peer-to-peer reviews to create a
statistical model of behaviors around companies' core values. It's starting
to get traction and he wants to make sure he's building something that will
live up to the platforms' purpose - to make work better for everyone.

Again, I really appreciate the time and insight. I hope we can do some
threat modeling together in the future, and if not I think I have a good
idea of who to introduce you to when I met them.

All best,
Josh
