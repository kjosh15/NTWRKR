You too, Doug. Srsly, let me know if you want to come visit Iceland - they
have a 6-month entrepreneur visa and I'm getting increasingly familiar with
the local governance, etc. It's a strange strange time out there!!!

Always happy to connect if you get a chance to.catch your breath or want to
beat ideas around. You're - as ever - one of my favorite thinkers.

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
