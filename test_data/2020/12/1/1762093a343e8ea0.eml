Zero need to apologise Josh, and I=E2=80=99m glad you were persistent! Both=
 Jack and Bernhard are great people, so I look forward to seeing how those =
conversations pan out.

There=E2=80=99s a one-pager here: https://insiderexpeditions.com/bensaunder=
s/ <https://insiderexpeditions.com/bensaunders/> =E2=80=93 it doesn=E2=80=
=99t have all the details yet (esp. pricing which we=E2=80=99re still final=
ising but circa $20-25k pp).

I=E2=80=99m pretty swamped for the rest of this week (hence the late-night =
emails!) but quieter next week if you wanted to jump on a call to discuss.

Huge thanks, and I hope all's well.
B
