Hey, all! Looking forward to hearing you all soon. :)

I've used a local TV/Radio station here before; being Iceland, you just
have to know someone's mother's cousin's brother's friend and they let you
rent their studio for pretty cheap - usually with an engineer to run it,
keep levels, etc.

OTOH, I'm also currently living in a giant farmhouse 20m away from
civilization with a nice fiber optic connection, so if you wanted me to use
a mic setup I could do that here also. Let me know if you want an intro to
the studio or more details on my space.

All best,
Josh
