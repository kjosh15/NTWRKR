Hi Josh!

Thanks for the links. I had seen the IDFA project of Sylvia from =
Columbia already. A friend curated the event. Quite wild, no? What a =
cool piece of journalism!

As I expand on this project/treatment and put pen to paper, there=E2=80=99=
s a few uncertainties lingering in regard to how GPT-3 would be used for =
the show.

Mind digging up some definitive answers on the following? We need to be =
100% on these. And this is where I could really use your help.
Can we get unbridled access to GPT-3? How? When? Is there a cost? If so, =
what is it=E2=80=94as it pertains to the show we=E2=80=99re proposing? =
(That will dictate budgets.)
Would we need to feed the GPT-3 system hand-curated answers on topics =
that our show would cover? Is there a cost also associated with that? If =
so, how much might it be?
How long would it take to feed enough data for the system to generate =
life-altering persuasive answers? (Vague question, I know.)
How can we guarantee that GPT-3 will be able to offer back persuasive =
answers? What=E2=80=99s the best example of this that you=E2=80=99ve =
found? We=E2=80=99ve discussed this before. But we need to be utterly =
certain that what we=E2=80=99re proposing is possible=E2=80=94logistically=
, financially, etc.
Is there a way to ensure that GPT-3 will remain accessible in the =
long-term?
What sorts of legalities will we run into with OpenAI, Microsoft or =
others? Is there an IP issue that could arise?
And possibly the most important question is: because we=E2=80=99ll be =
asking a network to put their logo on the show, how can we ensure GPT-3 =
won=E2=80=99t offer up racist or hateful language to those using it on =
the site? Quote below that gave me pause.
NYT: =E2=80=9CNot long after, Jerome Pesenti, who leads the Facebook =
A.I. lab, called GPT-3 =E2=80=9Cunsafe,=E2=80=9D pointing to sexist, =
racist and otherwise toxic language the system generated when asked to =
discuss women, Black people, Jews and the Holocaust.=E2=80=9D

Thanks a ton in advance! Just a sentence or two for each answer would be =
more than enough.

Matt
