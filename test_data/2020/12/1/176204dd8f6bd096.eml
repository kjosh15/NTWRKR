Hey, thanks Josh!

I've updated the shapes to fix two minor bugs, and I'm considering what's=
=20
up there as the final revision. I've also added a custom version of the=20
Ardiuno code that handles the WiFi Rev 2 hardware (I kinda reworked the=20
core into a kernel), with a very simple "event" concept that I might expand=
=20
on later -- to make plugins a bit easier. I'm calling this version 0.99j=20
<https://github.com/jejacks0n/crowbox/tree/main/ardiuno/cros_v099j/cros>,=
=20
because calling it v1 seemed not correct, version 0.100 seemed weird, and=
=20
adding a patch version also seemed not correct. =F0=9F=A4=B7=F0=9F=8F=BB=E2=
=80=8D=E2=99=82=EF=B8=8F

I've included an example node server=20
<https://github.com/jejacks0n/crowbox/tree/main/server> that implements the=
=20
API that's defined within the custom version of CrOS, which also supports=
=20
websockets -- this exhibits publishing an event on the CrowBox all the way=
=20
to the connected browser clients, in near real time -- potentially picking=
=20
it up on the server and implementing 3rd party API behaviors (e.g. telling=
=20
your IP camera that it should start recording to the cloud or something).

I've deployed this to a simple heroku app that I'll be finishing up in the=
=20
next week or so, but I won't write a novel about any of it this time. I=20
just wanted to put it back out there to share-alike. As part of this=20
effort, I've also made it clear that my repo isn't official -- but you're=
=20
welcome to take the "original" branch if you ever want to. I would still=20
very much like to see official forks that can pull in updates that y'all=20
make. But no biggie if that never happens -- there's nothing like not=20
having to do anything to allow others to easily find derivative work though=
.

I'm putting all of this together into a thing I'm calling The Corvus Ludus=
=20
Project (which is a satirical metal-band-esque website with a boring live=
=20
feed of a semi-suburban looking back yard with a crowbox). I'm aware that=
=20
the latin should probably be "Ludus Corvus", but that doesn't sound as=20
metal, haha, anyway, I'll be launching this soon (assuming designs and=20
audio production go as planned), and it can be found at corvusludus.live=20
<https://www.corvusludus.live>, when it's ready.

I'll be doing further nerdy things like processing the recorded video clips=
=20
for object recognition, to help understand and automatically categorize=20
things like crows, jays, squirrels, and unidentified events, but I doubt=20
that really falls within the concerns of this project exactly, so I won't=
=20
post further about that here -- but hope to eventually share my collated=20
experiment data at some point.

I've had a lot of fun building on all of these concepts that the team's put=
=20
together, so again, a serious thank you to everybody! Awesome work, and my=
=20
deepest gratitude for being part of my journey into this during the=20
pandemic. =F0=9F=99=8F

- Jeremy

Hey, thanks Josh!<div><br></div><div>I've updated the shapes to fix two min=
or bugs, and I'm considering what's up there as the final revision. I've al=
so added a custom version of the Ardiuno code that handles the WiFi Rev 2 h=
ardware (I kinda reworked the core into a kernel), with a very simple "even=
t" concept that I might expand on later -- to make plugins a bit easier. I'=
m calling this version <a href=3D"https://github.com/jejacks0n/crowbox/tree=
/main/ardiuno/cros_v099j/cros">0.99j</a>, because calling it v1 seemed not =
correct, version 0.100 seemed weird, and adding a patch version also seemed=
 not correct. =F0=9F=A4=B7=F0=9F=8F=BB=E2=80=8D=E2=99=82=EF=B8=8F</div><div=
><br></div><div>I've included an <a href=3D"https://github.com/jejacks0n/cr=
owbox/tree/main/server">example node server</a> that implements the API tha=
t's defined within the custom version of CrOS, which also supports websocke=
ts -- this exhibits publishing an event on the CrowBox all the way to the c=
onnected browser clients, in near real time -- potentially picking it up on=
 the server and implementing 3rd party API behaviors (e.g. telling your IP =
camera that it should start recording to the cloud or something).</div><div=
><br></div><div>I've deployed this to a simple heroku app that I'll be fini=
shing up in the next week or so, but I won't write a novel about any of it =
this time. I just wanted to put it back out there to share-alike. As part o=
f this effort, I've also made it clear that my repo isn't official -- but y=
ou're welcome to take the "original" branch if you ever want to. I would st=
ill very much like to see official forks that can pull in updates that y'al=
l make. But no biggie if that never happens -- there's nothing like not hav=
ing to do anything to allow others to easily find derivative work though.</=
div><div><br></div><div>I'm putting all of this together into a thing I'm c=
alling The Corvus Ludus Project (which is a satirical metal-band-esque webs=
ite with a boring live feed of a semi-suburban looking back yard with a cro=
wbox). I'm aware that the latin should probably be "Ludus Corvus", but that=
 doesn't sound as metal, haha, anyway, I'll be launching this soon (assumin=
g designs and audio production go as planned), and it can be found at&nbsp;=
<a href=3D"https://www.corvusludus.live">corvusludus.live</a>,&nbsp;when it=
's ready.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll be doing further nerdy things like =
processing the recorded video clips for object recognition, to help underst=
and and automatically categorize things like crows, jays, squirrels, and un=
identified events, but I doubt that really falls within the concerns of thi=
s project exactly, so I won't post further about that here -- but hope to e=
ventually share my collated experiment data at some point.</div><div><br></=
div><div><div>I've had a lot of fun building on all of these concepts that =
the team's put together, so again, a serious thank you to everybody! Awesom=
e work, and my deepest gratitude for being part of my journey into this dur=
ing the pandemic. =F0=9F=99=8F</div><div><br></div><div>- Jeremy</div><div>=

rene</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>Noteworthy features:</b></div><div><br=
></div><div>Modular concepts, where various subassemblies are intended to b=
e capable of being swapped out. This comes down to four primary subassembly=
 divisions:</div><div><br></div><div>- The housing subassembly - the primar=
y box that everything fits onto/into</div><div>- The lid subassembly - the =
sliding lid / rails, lid, perch platform, limit switches, and coin magazine=
</div><div>- The basket subassembly - the face plate and basket that slots =
onto the housing subassembly</div><div>- The electronics subassembly - weat=
her resistant box for the the Arduino</div><div><br></div><div>These subass=
emblies are separated into their component concepts so they can be replaced=
 or adjusted individually. For instance, the lid and basket subassemblies a=
ren=E2=80=99t glued to each other, or to the housing subassembly. They inte=
rlock and hold each other in place using a couple hitch pins, and can be re=
moved fairly easily for servicing. If you want to glue them in place, you a=
bsolutely can, but the idea is that aspects can be replaced to allow smalle=
r/more targeted experiments to be run =E2=80=94 for instance, I=E2=80=99m g=
oing to be replacing colors and swapping between my two box placements peri=
odically to see if different colors (or transparency) perform differently. =
This aspect of the design removes the need to have any access panels.</div>=
<div><br></div><div>Other parts of the design have similar interlocking con=
cepts. This is notable in the assembly steps of the basket, as pieces are s=
lotted in from the back of the face plate. The basket ribs are then slid in=
to position and things are bolted together, which creates a cohesive and st=
able subassembly that can then be glued more easily with minimal effort in =
holding / getting things aligned properly. I may post a couple photos/video=
s of this on my final build, because the order of operations matters a bit =
here.</div><div><br></div><div>Better weathering potential. Drainage holes =
have been added to the corners of the bottom panel that allow moisture to d=
rain (regardless of level / lean orientation). The electronics subassembly =
allows better whatever level of weatherizing you feel is needed. I personal=
ly have only built the box and then rubber banded one of the panels in plac=
e, so I can still easily access the electronics, but since the subassembly =
is designed to keep a gap between the inner walls of the housing subassembl=
y it means less water will be touching the surfaces that the electronics ar=
e mounted to.</div><div><br></div><div>The basket volume has increased by s=
ome ~15-20%? No, I didn=E2=80=99t do the hard math here, but the basket dep=
th has increased a full 1cm (90mm to 100mm), the sliding lid has 1cm more t=
ravel, and is a little more than 2cm wider.=C2=A0 That, and other design tw=
eaks to the basket increase the volume for food, and reduce the area that s=
craps or other material can accidentally fall it into the coin delivery are=
as. This may have an impact on accidental coin activations, but that&#39;s =
something I plan on running an experiment on -- in this version I actually =
just wanted to increase volume and will run some tests on different aspects=
 of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout and placement of parts is opt=
imized to get everything onto a single (790mm x 384mm or 31.1=E2=80=9D x 15=
.1=E2=80=9D) sheet for color parts, and the transparent parts can be double=
d up on a single sheet of the same dimensions. This allows ordering two col=
or sheets and a single (doubled up design) transparent sheet. So two crowbo=
xes, in only 3 sheets of acrylic. I know some laser cutters won=E2=80=99t b=
e able to accommodate that size, but I optimized for what was immediately a=
t hand during the pandemic, and that was the capabilities of Ponoko.</div><=
div><br></div><div>Transparent part usage was reduced in the housing subass=
embly, which means the housing is fully opaque when using an opaque acrylic=
 (no transparent parts come through from the back to the front except for t=
he lid). The logic here was to reduce areas where shadows/light or movement=
 could unpredictably transfer (visually speaking) from one side of the hous=
ing to the other.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom panel has some holes =
for drainage, and also a mirrored =E2=80=9Cinterface=E2=80=9D of slots that=
 sensors or subhousings can utilize in future revisions or iterations. For =
instance, the coin sensor uses this interface, as does the electronics suba=
ssembly, and each can be mirrored to use the right or left side depending o=
n build or deployment concerns. A similar concept is available on the botto=
m of the rails (to hang things from), but that=E2=80=99s not being utilized=
 in these designs.</div><div><br></div><div>The coin magazine has more capa=
city, and is designed to allow more flexibility in movement (in that it=E2=
=80=99s not glued to the lid), which makes jamming less likely (potentially=
 even when using non U.S. quarter sized coins). It also now slots into posi=
tion, so placement doesn&#39;t require measuring and gluing. It&#39;s held =
in position between the lid and the perch platform using a piece of styrene=
 without needing to glue it in place.</div><div><br></div><div>There=E2=80=
=99s basically no need for hot glue in any of these designs, but you=E2=80=
=99re welcome to hot glue the subassemblies together since it=E2=80=99s fai=
rly trivial to remove and might minimize rattling and other noise. I=E2=80=

shers=C2=A0(this would allow for minor versions -- v2.0 -&gt; v2.1 could be=
 only adjustments to the the basket subassembly, or changes to improve the =
base subassembly independently, or testing different material / color optio=

(is there a redundancy reason for the two limit switches that I&#39;m missi=
