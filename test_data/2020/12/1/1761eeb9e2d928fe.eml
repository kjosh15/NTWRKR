Hi Josh,

I don't manage some large company or run some innovative startup, therefore
thought it would not be of interest for me to bother you. But as you asked
twice...

I loved your TED talk on crows and your book on hacking work, which I was
thrilled to have you kindly sign in Dublin at the Science Gallery. Such a
cool place! Remembering their exhibition on infection that is particularly
relevant these days, especially the lanyard that everyone wore explained at
the (3:29) beginning of this intro video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3lozc9vusm4>. The lanyard had a green LE=
D
and red LED. Everyone entered with a green LED, but if you got close to
anyone with a red LED, your LED went red, infected. Exhibition staff were
dressed in hazmat suits and could cure visitors turning their LEDs green
again. It was nearly impossible to stay green even when there were only a
few people there. Most interestingly, visitors at the
exhibition desperately tried to keep their LED green and behaved much alike
shoppers in a grocery store today, avoiding eye contact and shuffling away
from a 6ft radius of another person. Another (1:16) project
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D0-rnYGBQbpE> ends with the quote, "I hop=
e
the politicians will react..."

My career went on pause due to narcolepsy which is extremely difficult to
live with. Previously I did architecture and coolest projects I worked on
were a ski jump <http://jdsa.eu/hop/> and this building
<https://www.dezeen.com/2017/01/23/oma-qatar-foundation-headquarters-comple=
ted-doha-architecture-photographs/>
that
is cooler than it looks. Now, I hope to make CNC furniture, something I
have wanted to do for a very long time. Moved to Baltimore, MD to use what
i think is the best makerspace in the US, Openworks
<https://www.openworksbmore.org/>. They haven't reopened due to Covid, but
soon hopefully. :)

Hope you enjoyed my email! Hope you're well and keeping safe.

James.
