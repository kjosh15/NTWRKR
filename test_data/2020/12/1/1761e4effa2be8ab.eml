A bit; I think the big problem we have is that we may be able to work with
creating a measurement platform for a LOT of companies, and having "six
values of DEI" that everyone uses doesn't create change - it just forces
unnecessary comparisons.

Don't suppose you'd be up for a call regarding the topic? FWIW, you're top
of my list for recommending them as an outside expert, so getting an update
on your service offering couldn't hurt!

All best,
Josh
