Hi Josh,

Hope you are well. GRID has grown and matured quite a bit since we last spo=
ke. We're focusing our content strategy pretty narrowly on the spreadsheet/=
data/analytics space and we're well served on that front.

However, if you happen upon some great opportunities for placements on anyt=
hing from "the future of data" to "leadership principles", I'm all ears and=
 would be happy to go with a similar arrangement as the one we had back in =
early 2019.
