Steve, you are a genius and a scholar. The wiki piece is beautiful - super
comprehensive, but readily skimmable AND useful for anyone who actually
wants to hack on things. Excellent stuff!! The only change I would make
would be to link the Crowbox Google Group in the last paragraph.

Similarly, the Voltaic looks PERFECT. I'm assuming we're going on the
premise that if it's too dark for the Voltaic it's too dark for birds to
use the box, yes? I ask as I am spending a shit ton of time in the dark
these days and only notice bird activity when it's at least dusky... but
can see a fair amount then. Any rules of thumb about how bright it has to
be to operate the box using this thing?

Stoked to see off-the-shelf hardware developing that we can plug into the
system; this is super helpful!!

All best,
Josh
