So, this is good because your question forces me to question the quick math
I did on solar generation/crowbox consumption:

An idle Crowbox pulls .235 watts of power, continuously. All day, and all
night. Even though no birds visit at night, the Crowbox doesn't know what
time it is, or that it has gotten dark.

The solar panel I bought from Voltaic is a 2 watt panel. Solar panels
notoriously deliver less energy than their rating so I figure I'll be
pessimistic and assume we'll net 1 watt of power on average from the solar
panel in 'ordinary' daytime conditions. Even though winter time is hardly
ordinary conditions.

Where I live in northern Idaho, the winter 'days' are currently 7.5 hours
long. Obviously, this is low southern sun. It seems to alternate, one sunny
winter day, one cloudy winter day, over and over. Less than ideal solar
conditions, same as you.

Some thumbnail math:

Over 24 hours, a Crowbox consumes a total of 1200mAh.

We (Idaho) currently have 16.5 hours of night. This means 825mAh consumed
by the Crowbox during a time when the solar panel is pushing NO energy back
into the system.

2 watts is 400 mA at 5 volts. So 7.5 hours of daylight would generate
3000mAh *IF* the panel were delivering a full 2 watts of energy for a full
7.5 hours. NEITHER of which are going to happen in the winter.

So, 1 watt is 200mA at 5 volts. 7.5 hours of daylight would generate
1500mAh if the panel averaged 1 watt of output over the 7.5 hours of
'daylight'. This might be pessimistic enough and accounts for better
conditions during mid-day than just after sunrise and just before sunset,
flattening to an average of 1 watt, continuous.

If we could rely on the panel to deliver a full watt, a Crowbox would just
keep on running. We'd be generating around 20% more energy than we require.

Note that this doesn't account for ANY opening/closing of the Crowbox lid,
so we can probably say that this activity could easily eat that extra 20%.
Which would mean we're running with no effective margin of safety except
the stored energy in the power bank.

A 6,400mAh (rated) power bank from Voltaic would run a Crowbox for 72
continuous hours on its own. If our panel/weather conditions underperform,
we'd be losing an hour or two of that reserve juice each day. Which would
still run a Crowbox for weeks.

So it's a risk saying that this can be done with a 2 watt panel UNTIL we
know exactly how much energy we are really getting from our panel. When my
2W panel comes I'll hook it to an ammeter and get some precise output
measurements under a couple of different conditions. Full, direct [winter]
sun, and cloudy day.

I wish we could turn off the Arduino UNO's power LED. I know we could
reduce power consumption by 20% without that LED. The only way to turn it
off is to take a razor and cut the trace on the Arduino's circuit board.
Not something I'm comfortable pointing out to people.

I still owe the project some research on SLEEP mode. I'll make some time to
do that work. If it could mean users could save money by not requiring a
larger battery or larger solar panel, it's a meaningful feature.

-Steve
