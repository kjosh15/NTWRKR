Awesome, thanks! Really nice work here, BTW. It was also very reassuring to
hear that we're on the same page about providing access to GIT but not
wanting to take on endless support of every hobby fork that comes along. I
really want to support folk's enthusiasm for the project, though!

All best,
Josh
