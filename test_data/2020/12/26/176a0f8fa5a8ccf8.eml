Hey! Thanks for pulling this together; I think what you wrote looks great
but would contact Jamie (?) before you put it out to let him know he really
encouraged us, that we're going to put out a notice for other folks, etc.
Happy to do that myself - let me know and I'll get something out to him
ASAP.

And no, not hit by reindeer - just trying to keep away from the screen as
much as possible as a favor to my kids. ;)

Will reply to your other emails now!
