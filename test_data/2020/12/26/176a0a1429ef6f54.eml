We did indeed! Why?

Glad you liked the chard - it=E2=80=99s one of those strange little things =
that you
don=E2=80=99t normally think much about until it happens to be the thing yo=
u always
have with you that saves your bacon. I=E2=80=99ve had one for years and it=
=E2=80=99s
rescued me on several occasions, so I figured you should have one too!

How was the lamb and Pinot??

Lots of love,
Josh
