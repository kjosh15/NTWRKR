Hey! You around? Were you trampled by reindeer over the holiday?  :D

I'm going to paste some text now, it's a post I've written for the Google
Group to roll out the existence of the GitHub repository. I need you to
sign off on the tone and content, and let me know if I've missed or
mis-handled anything:

<pasted article follows>

Hello! Lately there have been some questions about modifying the CrOS
operating system so it seems the right time to point out that there is a
GitHub repository for the CrOS source code:

https://github.com/CrowBox/cros

The Crowbox is a fully open-sourced project; both the hardware and software
are offered to the public and we encourage anyone who is interested to make
their own contributions to the project.

We don=E2=80=99t have a formal =E2=80=9CBest Practices=E2=80=9D document bu=
t there is a single core
concept that we tried to adhere to as we designed the CrOS software:
Simplicity.

Mainly, we wanted to ensure that anyone who wanted to modify the CrOS
software could do so easily and safely. We tried to write plain, clear,
heavily-commented code that would be accessible even to those without much
programming experience.

This is why the CrOS software is essentially one big loop which runs with
no messaging, no threads, and no delayed execution. Tasks which take a long
time, such as opening and closing the sliding lid, are blocking operations
by design. By employing one single inner loop and blocking calls, we feel
that we=E2=80=99re helping amateur programmers avoid the most confounding c=
lass of
bugs- Bugs caused by code that executes at unexpected times.

Certainly it=E2=80=99s possible to build CrOS with features that more close=
ly
resemble a true operating system, but we intentionally avoided this model
to keep things simple for end users.

It has always been our hope that CrOS users would eventually require
features to allow for internet connectivity, wireless communication, and
interfacing with cameras or other sensors. Some of these features can be
added without increasing the complexity of the Crowbox too much, and other
features bring with them overhead that will require the CrOS code to become
more complex.

If you decide to publish a modified version of the CrOS software, please
create a fork in the GitHub repository and please accept the responsibility
of documenting and supporting your version of the code.

We=E2=80=99re always around here on the Google Group if you have questions,
concerns or ideas.

Thanks!

-Steve
