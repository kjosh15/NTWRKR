Yes, hello! It was great catching up, though it's obvious we waited too
long to get back in touch. I had too much stuff on my mind to get out in
any coherent fashion. Anyway!

I'm working on a power article for the wiki. I'll make a post in the group
when it's ready and point people to the wiki. The power document is subject
to change so I thought a WIKI article I could edit was a better choice than
posting all of it in the group. Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

I'll make some links to the GitHub repository as well.

-Steve

across a lawn/terrain to the box, but we don&#39;t know offhand of a good c=
able (that is, a nice long cable) that can carry 5VDC a long distance and n=
ot also involve loss of precious voltage. Mainly because we never explored =
it so we don&#39;t have a good idea of cost, and we don&#39;t have data on =
voltage loss (to wire resistance) across that distance. In the current plan=
s, we very strongly suggest (demand, really) that users employ a GFCI outle=
t and/or an in-line GFCI with their A/C extension cord to promote safety. I=
f there&#39;s anyone out there who has time/interest/capability to research=
 this we&#39;d love to publish their results!<br><br>2) Portable power. The=
 demand for this seems huge and we did limited preliminary testing quite so=
me time ago, but with some discouraging results. We tested five banks and o=
nly the VOLTAIC brand properly worked on low-current devices without shutti=
ng itself off. The nominal use-case these devices are designed for means th=
at 95% of them have auto-shutoff functions which are largely unlabeled. Tha=
t said, while Voltaic power banks are a little expensive they&#39;re less e=
xpensive than most in-line GFCI switches for extension cords and so could b=
e a good tradeoff for many people. Is anyone out there able to do an update=
d study on currently available Voltaic banks to see which ones DON&#39;T ha=
ve the auto-shut-off feature so we can point people at good alternatives?<b=

t didn&#39;t auto-shutoff was Voltaic, and that was some time ago. Updated =
research is needed.<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-mark" style=3D"max-he=
