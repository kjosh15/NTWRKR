Was really hoping to surprise you by jumping on the call tomorrow - whether
you were there or not - but it looks like we=E2=80=99ll be in full swing wi=
th the
grandparents, cousins, etc. and I=E2=80=99m in charge of much of the cookin=
g. So
instead I wish you all the best in closing out 2020. Hopefully we=E2=80=99l=
l be
able to reconnect f2f in 2021 sometime!!!

Yours,
Josh
