Thanks for this! I also sent a rolling invitation if that suits you; happy
to end it at any time but at this point am very keen to continue exploring
the narrative. We can decide if we want to include chess or wait for a RL
introduction post-vaccines; I'm still not sure virtual captures enough
fidelity.

I'll take a look at your Pith as soon as I'm able to get some undisturbed
time; today I'm due to eat putrefied skate with my brother and father in
law which will include copious Brenniv=C3=ADn (a schnapps called "Black Dea=
th")
and subsequently an early trip to bed. I hope you've got something even
more fun planned!
