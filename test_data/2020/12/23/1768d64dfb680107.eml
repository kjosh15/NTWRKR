Wow, amazing progress.

Regarding your D&I behaviors - I think you'll have to have that evolve over
time. When I do organizational assessments there are some standard
questions I ask -- about belonging, inclusion, the organization feeling
fair for "people like me," etc. But your list of those questions, the index
you essentially create, that is your product.

Things are good on my side. I've been excitedly growing my
consulting practice and with a few really talented folks and we're
at/beyond capacity through at least Q2. Now I'm really needing to think
about how to grow (and to what extent I even want that...). I have
clarified the project among them that has the most charge for me right now.
In short, it's designing and co-facilitating a really targeted burnout
recovery program in a retreat setting when things open back up. I've been
working on it in the background for a long time and finally ready to get it
going. I'll tell you more about it when we talk!

Have a relaxing holiday - I hope you're getting a nice break!

p.s. - for rescheduling our time -- do you have any time the week of the
4th or the 11th? at 8am PST or later? I only see 7am PST on your Calendly.
