 the yard, but it had a hose and some Mechanics in and felt scary. Then trie=
d going into a hole by one of the birch trees further down the hill here, bu=
t again it felt scary. Kept trying to find a hole I felt welcome in and real=
ized I was just scared, so on impulse asked my spirit animal for help.</div>=
<div><br></div><div>They suddenly appeared underneath me as though I were a t=
iny infant and ran directly into a hole that opened up in the earth. It was c=
old, dark, fecund, and narrow, but I clung to their back and we raced throug=
h it, around twists and turns, sometimes even upside down, often into dead e=
nds or forks. I began to fear we wouldn=E2=80=99t get anywhere and realized t=
hat was part of it so let go, and then we began to go faster until we were l=
oping down a wide tunnel and then were suddenly running through a wide leafl=
ess birch forest over thick crusted snow.</div><div><br></div><div>We ran fo=
r a while until we came to an open space and then i realized it was full of m=
y spirit animal in all kinds of colors, hundreds of them all playing and nos=
ing around. They all jumped and toyed at us and encouraged us to go further,=
 through a dark break in the wood to something ahead.</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>But I insisted my purpose was only to have come out of the tunnel and tha=
t I should go back. They acknowledged me and rushed against me, rubbing thei=
r coats against my chest and sliding through my skin (??), marking me with t=
heir scent/light. Then several of them took my fingertips in their jaws and h=
eld them, also holding my eyes to remind me that our teeth are sharp and our=
 eyes are keen. I felt a rush of energy then, and we turned to go back and t=
he tunnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ran loping back in animal form, but a=
lso as big as myself, and it was as easy as climbing a ladder, and I came up=
 by my foot where I lay on the kitchen floor and snuggled into my body and w=
aited, very alert, for the drumming to end.</div></body></html>=
