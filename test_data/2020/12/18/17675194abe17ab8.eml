Finally looked up how to do Minecraft and would love access to your realm
if you all are game - happy to kick in on the fees also! Let me know if
your kids are down with this; Othinn's *really* excited about Minecraft.

Otherwise I hope the family is doing well - shit looks crazy from outside
the US, but as with this spring I hope RL is more normal than it sounds. We
all talk about your family often - really counting our blessings we got to
pod with you guys!

Happy holidays,
Josh
