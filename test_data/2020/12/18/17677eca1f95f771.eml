s - next time will definitely use headphones as I think it=E2=80=99ll be mor=
e effective. Had several false starts thinking that the music was too fast, w=
as too hot, wasn=E2=80=99t feeling anything, etc. and each time dropped deep=
er into it as soon as I let go of the concern.</div><div><br></div><div>Firs=
t I tried going into a hole in the yard, but it had a hose and some Mechanic=
s in and felt scary. Then tried going into a hole by one of the birch trees f=
urther down the hill here, but again it felt scary. Kept trying to find a ho=
le I felt welcome in and realized I was just scared, so on impulse asked my s=
pirit animal for help.</div><div><br></div><div>They suddenly appeared under=
neath me as though I were a tiny infant and ran directly into a hole that op=
ened up in the earth. It was cold, dark, fecund, and narrow, but I clung to t=
heir back and we raced through it, around twists and turns, sometimes even u=
pside down, often into dead ends or forks. I began to fear we wouldn=E2=80=99=
t get anywhere and realized that was part of it so let go, and then we began=
 to go faster until we were loping down a wide tunnel and then were suddenly=
 running through a wide leafless birch forest over thick crusted snow.</div>=
<div><br></div><div>We ran for a while until we came to an open space and th=
en i realized it was full of my spirit animal in all kinds of colors, hundre=
ds of them all playing and nosing around. They all jumped and toyed at us an=
d encouraged us to go further, through a dark break in the wood to something=
 ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>But I insisted my purpose was only to have c=
ome out of the tunnel and that I should go back. They acknowledged me and ru=
shed against me, rubbing their coats against my chest and sliding through my=
 skin (??), marking me with their scent/light. Then several of them took my f=
ingertips in their jaws and held them, also holding my eyes to remind me tha=
t our teeth are sharp and our eyes are keen. I felt a rush of energy then, a=
nd we turned to go back and the tunnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ran lop=
ing back in animal form, but also as big as myself, and it was as easy as cl=
imbing a ladder, and I came up by my foot where I lay on the kitchen floor a=
nd snuggled into my body and waited, very alert, for the drumming to end.</d=
