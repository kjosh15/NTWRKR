v><br></div><div>I played the drumming on my phone instead of with headphone=
s - next time will definitely use headphones as I think it=E2=80=99ll be mor=
e effective. Has several false starts thinking that I found the music too fa=
st, was too hot, wasn=E2=80=99t feeling anything, etc. and each time dropped=
 deeper into it as soon as I let go of the concern.</div><div><br></div><div=
>First I tried going into a hole in the yard, but it had a hose and some Mec=
hanics in and felt scary. Then tried going into a hole by one of the birch t=
rees further down the hill here, but again it felt scary. Kept trying to fin=
d a hole I felt welcome in and realized I was just scared, so on impulse ask=
ed my spirit animal for help.</div><div><br></div><div>They suddenly appeare=
d underneath me as though I were a tiny infant and ran directly into a hole t=
hat opened up in the earth. It was cold, dark, fecund, and narrow, but I clu=
ng to their back and we raced through it, around twists and turns, sometimes=
 even upside down, often into dead ends or forks. I began to fear we wouldn=E2=
=80=99t get anywhere and realized that was part of it so let go, and then we=
 began to go faster until we were loping down a wide tunnel and then were su=
ddenly running through a wide leafless birch forest over thick crusted snow.=
</div><div><br></div><div>We ran for a while until we came to an open space a=
nd then i realized it was full of my spirit animal in all kinds of colors, h=
undreds of them all playing and nosing around. They all jumped and toyed at u=
s and encouraged us to go further, through a dark break in the wood to somet=
hing ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>But I insisted my purpose was only to h=
ave come out of the tunnel and that I should go back. They acknowledged me a=
nd rushed against me, rubbing their coats against my chest and sliding throu=
gh my skin (??), marking me with their scent/light. Then several of them too=
k my fingertips in their jaws and held them, also holding my eyes to remind m=
e that our teeth are sharp and our eyes are keen. I felt a rush of energy th=
en, and we turned to go back and the tunnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ra=
n loping back in animal form, but also as big as myself, and it was as easy a=
s climbing a ladder, and I came up by my foot where I lay on the kitchen flo=
or and snuggled into my body and waited, very alert, for the drumming to end=
.</div></body></html>=
