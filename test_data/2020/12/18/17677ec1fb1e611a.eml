s - next time will definitely use headphones as I think it=E2=80=99ll be mor=
e effective. Has several false starts thinking that I found the music too fa=
st, was too hot, wasn=E2=80=99t feeling anything, etc. and each time dropped=
 deeper into it as soon as I let go of&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First t=
ried going into a hole in the yard, but it had a hose and some Mechanics in a=
nd felt scary. Then tried going into a hole by one of the birch trees furthe=
r down the hill here, but again it felt scary. Kept trying to find a hole I f=
elt welcome in and realized I was just scared, so on impulse asked my spirit=
 animal for help.</div><div><br></div><div>They suddenly appeared underneath=
 me as though I were a tiny infant and ran directly into a hole that opened u=
p in the earth. It was cold, dark, fecund, and narrow, but I clung to their b=
ack and we raced through it, around twists and turns, sometimes even upside d=
own, often into dead ends or forks. I began to fear we wouldn=E2=80=99t get a=
nywhere and realized that was part of it so let go, and then we began to go f=
aster until we were loping down a wide tunnel and then were suddenly running=
 through a wide leafless birch forest over thick crusted snow.</div><div><br=
></div><div>We ran for a while until we came to an open space and then i rea=
lized it was full of my spirit animal in all kinds of colors, hundreds of th=
em all playing and nosing around. They all jumped and toyed at us and encour=
aged us to go further, through a dark break in the wood to something ahead.<=
/div><div><br></div><div>But I insisted my purpose was only to have come out=
 of the tunnel and that I should go back. They acknowledged me and rushed ag=
ainst me, rubbing their coats against my chest and sliding through my skin (=
??), marking me with their scent/light. Then several of them took my fingert=
ips in their jaws and held them, also holding my eyes to remind me that our t=
eeth are sharp and our eyes are keen. I felt a rush of energy then, and we t=
urned to go back and the tunnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ran loping bac=
k in animal form, but also as big as myself, and it was as easy as climbing a=
 ladder, and I came up by my foot where I lay on the kitchen floor and snugg=
led into my body and waited, very alert, for the drumming to end.</div></bod=
