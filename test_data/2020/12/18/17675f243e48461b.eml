I was running past tabs and came across something I'd opened a couple
months ago:

https://read.iopipe.com/how-to-use-aws-lambda-to-send-high-volume-emails-at-scale-10efe65b2f32

Looks like a nice tut on how to use Lambda to scalably and securely batch
bulk email use AWS' SES. Upsides include easy error recovery, high scale
for low cost, and all-in-one AWS platforming. Downside == more dev time,
but if this is critical path might be worth looking at as a first step.

best,
Josh
