Stephanie,

Got another focused question for you, this time on a contract I'm trying to
sign before the holidays w/ the NYTimes & Accenture (who are, not
surprisingly, lawyered up the wazoo)!

The question is whether or not I currently file a W-2. Their payroll
provider can apparently pay an S or C corp in full, but is required to pay
a sole proprietorship only AFTER withholding individual and payroll taxes.

The reason this is tricky is that I'd like to move the contract to my
Icelandic company (to be formulated in January) to minimize my tax burden,
but they're not sure if they *can*. Note it's likely their payroll provider
can send payment to a foreign entity, but not include workman's comp (which
shouldn't be an issue here.)

So my question is what the impact of them withholding those taxes and what
you'd suggest!

Much obliged,
Josh
