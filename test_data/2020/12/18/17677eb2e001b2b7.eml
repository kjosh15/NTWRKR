s - next time will def use headphones as I think it=E2=80=99ll be more effec=
tive.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First tried going into a hole in the ya=
rd, but it had a hose and some Mechanics in and felt scary. Then tried going=
 into a hole by one of the birch trees further down the hill here, but again=
 it felt scary. Kept trying to find a hole I felt welcome in and realized I w=
as just scared, so on impulse asked my spirit animal for help.</div><div><br=
></div><div>They suddenly appeared underneath me as though I were a tiny inf=
ant and ran directly into a hole that opened up in the earth. It was cold, d=
ark, fecund, and narrow, but I clung to their back and we raced through it, a=
round twists and turns, sometimes even upside down, often into dead ends or f=
orks. I began to fear we wouldn=E2=80=99t get anywhere and realized that was=
 part of it so let go, and then we began to go faster until we were loping d=
own a wide tunnel and then were suddenly running through a wide leafless bir=
ch forest over thick crusted snow.</div><div><br></div><div>We ran for a whi=
le until we came to an open space and then i realized it was full of my spir=
it animal in all kinds of colors, hundreds of them all playing and nosing ar=
ound. They all jumped and toyed at us and encouraged us to go further, throu=
gh a dark break in the wood to something ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>But=
 I insisted my purpose was only to have come out of the tunnel and that I sh=
ould go back. They acknowledged me and rushed against me, rubbing their coat=
s against my chest and sliding through my skin (??), marking me with their s=
cent/light. Then several of them took my fingertips in their jaws and held t=
hem, also holding my eyes to remind me that our teeth are sharp and our eyes=
 are keen. I felt a rush of energy then, and we turned to go back and the tu=
nnel was huge ahead of me/us and I ran loping back in animal form, but also a=
s big as myself, and it was as easy as climbing a ladder, and I came up by m=
y foot where I lay on the kitchen floor and snuggled into my body and waited=
, very alert, for the drumming to end.</div></body></html>=
