Another quick question; are you ok with us moving the utilities over to

igure out where it is I can look further into it - regardless, you shouldn&=

e whole array - there&#39;s an extension cord that reaches to under the boo=
kshelves on the lefthand side. Unplug that, count to thirty, and plug it ba=
ck in and see if the signal improves. Let us know if that helps!</div></div=
