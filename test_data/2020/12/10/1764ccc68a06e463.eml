Appreciate the offer! Friday at 9am GMT works well, but we're up in
Akureyri so it'll have to be zoom. Can you send an invite, or shall I?

Looking forward to it,
Josh

    <p>A well known Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Balaji Srinivasan,

    </p>
    Monerium&#39;s not-so-secret secret mission is to fix fiat - or at leas=
t
    improve it significantly - by using blockchains to remove
    intermediaries in mainstream commercial transactions. <br>
    <p>Towards that end, we became the first company authorized to issue
      e-money on blockchains. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Which is a Big Deal because the EU just announced a proposal for
      Markets in Crypto Assets which stipulates that all &quot;stablecoins&=
quot;
      in Europe should be licensed as e-money. <br>

      and behind the scenes for ways to &quot;flatten finance&quot; <br>
