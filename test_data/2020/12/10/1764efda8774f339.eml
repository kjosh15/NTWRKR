 A new and improved version of Google Maps under which the majority of peop=
le can get clear, concise data on how any facet of function around them is =
done currently and has been done in the past. In a simple manner (branching=
 system), with a side opportunity for any individual to use their creativit=
y and problem solving to add their solution to any particular facet they fe=
el passionate about and share it with the community.=C2=A0
Leading towards the majority of people being truly educated about their sur=
roundings and feeling empowered to change the course of any facet they feel=
 needs an improvement no matter what age or status.=C2=A0
Growing people that feel like, even tho they are stuck in the current situa=
tion that they may be in, they still can try and improve on their surroundi=
ngs using problem solving. Or at least simply knowing more about their surr=
oundings and surroundings of other people, no matter the state or continent=
. Being able to compare different ways of doing things ,city to city or cou=
ntry to country, and the results of those ways . Finding and creating, ente=
rtaining different ones. Together looking for a better one.=C2=A0
Unlike in today's age, letting some people in "power" and media to confuse =
everyone with their beliefs and opinions. Clouding the actual state of matt=
er.=C2=A0
This way of functioning would bring the focus back on the matter at hand, a=
nd bump any person willing, into action no matter what status, age or condi=
tion they r under at the moment.=C2=A0


Look, Josh I think you're amazing and you have the skills, experience and d=
esire to make real good change in this world.=C2=A0
Honestly I, and majority of people really don't get to be in that position,=
 weather that be lack of money, schooling or whatever ,to possibility risk =
everyday survival and go for the big dreams.=C2=A0
For me, I have my daughter that comes before it all. Nobody else, so it's a=
ll on me. And that's OK, life is such. I have to do things , on my own, tha=
t i rather would not, but have to in order to survive.=C2=A0
So i cant fully chase on something that big.=C2=A0=C2=A0The diversity of so=
lutions might be helpful. And if not, then at least they truly know the rea=
l condition of the way their surrounding and other sides of the world is op=
erating. And that's a real good start.
My idea might not be anything, or might be amazing ,I don't know.
I might not be great at pitching ideas to you, or have the skills=C2=A0 and=
 experience that you have. But I LOVE this planet and the aboundand life th=
at it contains, and that is a way that I see that people would get really k=
nowledgeable and empowered to make it better.=C2=A0
And I see the potential in that idea of moving the human potential in the m=
ajority of people, a step up.

Thank you so so soooo much for answering my emails and considering my optio=
n. Even tho I'm not giving you what ur asking for, but if you ever feel lik=
e taking it on, I would always be willing to try to answer and figure out a=
ny particular question that could move this thing towards materialising.=C2=
=A0

Reason I'm hoping you be moved by this and take it on is because I have to =
focus on my current situation and not the whole world's.=C2=A0
You can make that idea so much better if it moves you, and actually take it=
 to where it needs to be.
Hope it makes sense.=C2=A0

Hey Josh,
I've sent you some messages couple of years ago about that idea that I had,=
 that i think would help the majority of humans be truly conscious about ou=
r environment and have a way to individually add their own solutions and re=
ally focus on the matter at hand.=C2=A0
Honestly,=C2=A0 at the time I was using way to much cannabis and was way to=
o much in my thoughts.=C2=A0
I have been off of that for a long time now, yet the same concept really ma=
kes so much since to me.=C2=A0
You gave me a great advice , which is to try to explain it in 30 seconds or=
 whatnot ( like an elevator pitch).=C2=A0=C2=A0
I'm gonna attempt to do that to you now.=C2=A0

Imagine a different level to google maps on which you can access any busine=
ss around you, and learn facts ( not opinions ) on how exactly it works, wh=
at, why, as well as how it was done before the current way it's done.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0
From the base of the company (or whatnot), outward one click at a time. As =
much as you want to know. Not all of it just put together.=C2=A0But branchi=
ng out as you keep pressing the further questions, and get answers on the c=
urrent situation or how it used to be done.=C2=A0
That would be anything, from water=C2=A0 menagment in your community, to ot=
her communities. From schooling structures to energy types and usages, reas=
ons one is widely used and reasons others are not at the moment. From where=
 your meat and veggies are coming from to how the process goes.=C2=A0Just f=
acts.=C2=A0
It's truly getting to know our surroundings and other people's surroundings=
 by asking those deeper questions and getting answers to it on how it's don=
e now, and how it used to be done. Without opinions.=C2=A0
On the side to that, a social component, under which you personally can giv=
e your own solution that wouldn't be shown on the facts side, but on that s=
ocial potential solutions.There could be a side for opinions there, but it =
wouldn't be shown with the facts.=C2=A0=C2=A0Having the opportunity to give=
 options on how it could be done for the better, or worse.=C2=A0
Under it, there could even be ways that companies could put on rewards for =
the best solution to their particular problems. You can vote for particular=
 solutions, and take into account the reasons for why it would work or why =
it wouldn't.=C2=A0
I think this kind of a system would make people truly knowledgeable and act=
ivated towards making a potentially better present and future for all.=C2=
=A0

I hope you can see my vision of it and see the potential that i see,=C2=A0
let me know either way.
Thank you,=C2=A0Jelena Jankovic

family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">I've sent you some messages couple of=
 years ago about that idea that I had, that i think would help the majority=
 of humans be truly conscious about our environment and have a way to indiv=
idually add their own solutions and really focus on the matter at hand.&nbs=

nestly,&nbsp; at the time I was using way to much cannabis and was way too =
much in my thoughts.&nbsp;</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial,=

 which is to try to explain it in 30 seconds or whatnot ( like an elevator =
pitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-s=

ferent level to google maps on which you can access any business around you=
, and learn facts ( not opinions ) on how exactly it works, what, why, as w=
ell as how it was done before the current way it's done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><=

want to know. Not all of it just put together.&nbsp;</div><div style=3D"fon=

it used to be done.&nbsp;</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, Arial, =

our community, to other communities. From schooling structures to energy ty=
pes and usages, reasons one is widely used and reasons others are not at th=

s surroundings by asking those deeper questions and getting answers to it o=

 be shown with the facts.&nbsp;</div><div style=3D"font-family:Helvetica, A=

hat companies could put on rewards for the best solution to their particula=
r problems. You can vote for particular solutions, and take into account th=
