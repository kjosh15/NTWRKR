A brief call could be good; let me know if you have time at 8 or 8:30am /
1:30pm EST tomorrow, as well as what time you're leaving Sat. Otherwise,
some more clarifying questions:

- What remains, if anything, to be packed beyond the 15 boxes (aside from
the stuffed animals)?
- How many boxes do you estimate they will fill?
- Is it reasonable to think you could fill them by this weekend?
- Can you determine which boxes of kids books are Icelandic and which are
English?
- Is there one single box with legos?
- Any ideas on how you could get the boxes to the port for shipping, and is
that possible by this weekend?
- Sans that, can you drop off a set of boxes at a FedEx office by this
weekend?

Again, we're trying to figure out if we should/could:

a) Ship a subset of boxes by air before you leave to get here for the
holidays (i.e., boy's clothes, a couple boxes of books in english, legos,
and the "2nd shipment" box),
b) Ship everything by sea before you leave,
c) Ship everything by sea after you leave.

Option (a) is most expensive, option (b) is most difficult (I'm guessing!)
and option (c) is most time consuming. We're still getting info from the
shippers; it looks like we'll have to itemize everything and pay insurance,
etc. etc. so there's a lot of back-and-forth we're trying to cut through.
Thanks for working through all this with us!

All best,
Josh
