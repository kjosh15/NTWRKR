Chris,

Additional questions, revised version attached. If you can get me the below
I think we're almost down to spit and polish.

1. I need the # of employees for the Technology & Media company

4. Can you regenerate it closer to 750x350 or 800x400? I was able to change
it but it looks like ass.

5. Is there a graph where features are listed and compared that might be
more favorable to our "strongly bias-adjusted data, longitudinal analysis,
and direct-to-action value mapping" feature set? If we can include a few
more which seem like "nice" features (but not really effective) which we
also have and the competition doesn't that would help paint the picture
nicely.

Put another way, we need to emphasize that we're unique in providing those
elements, and competitive in providing everything else useful the
competition does. A checkbox graph would be helpful in this, and I seem to
recall you working on one. What came of it?

6. This graph looks good but not believable. I know I'm being pedantic
here, but this matters. Is there a ready data source we can use to "make
the line more jagged" so it appears to reflect an actual real world hockey
stick of growth?

8. I edited your text somewhat; please approve/edit.

9. Can you abridge the XLS to something that would fit to the left side of
the screen here? Again, the best example I can think of is a table that
includes the assumptions as per this deck:

https://alejandrocremades.com/silicon-valley-legend-creates-pitch-deck-temp=
late-for-entrepreneurs/

Could use your help here.

10. You make a good point, but I'm not confident that will entice a US
investor. Series B sounds great as a followup once you're growing too fast
to slow down, but this I think this initial round needs to infer serious
growth immediately. Let me know if you disagree; in the meantime I've tried
to split the difference.

- J
