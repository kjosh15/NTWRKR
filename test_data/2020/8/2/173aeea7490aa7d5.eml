Realized we didn=E2=80=99t talk about food ordering - we used fresh direct =
not
amazon fresh. Pea pod is another option if you want to skip amazon.

Big question is selection vs price, and then also how their produce comes
across. IMHO best strategy is to try it a few times and see what you like
or don=E2=80=99t and how it compares in price vs effort. IIR these services=
 tend to
be best for staples like canned goods, but obviously YMMV!

love,
Josh
