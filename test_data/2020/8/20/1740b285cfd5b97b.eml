 I learned a few things about Remind:

1. remind.com integrates with g.class -
https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000253944-Add-app-integrations

In other words, teachers should be able to set up individual remind
accounts for their classes and share material directly from google
classroom.

2. It should be possible to use remind itself to get everyone on the
emergency contact system (Remind) by automatically creating accounts for
everyone:

   https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001899304-What-is-rostering=
-

Does this help?

best,
Josh
