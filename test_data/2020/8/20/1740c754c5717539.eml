Spoke to Carl yesterday - he rescheduled a day-of mtg last minute. He's
quite interested in your solution, although he'd looking at other options
in the same space that can do whole-store sterilization (about which I have
my doubts, but whatever.) Do you have an up-to-date deck you'd like me to
pass over, and are you comfortable with me providing your squarespace URL,
or do you have your own URL up yet? Finally, are you confident you can
deliver at scale if Carl decides to role out a pilot?

All best,
Josh
