If it's ok I'd love to take a shot at redesigning the survey; for example,
each time a person has to click "next" you'll lose between 10-25% of your
audience. Putting it all on a single page ought to simplify the sheet it
produces also, and hopefully we can use it to centralize your "single point
of truth" communications database.

One problem is that I don't see how this verifies people's entries. I.e.,
couldn't I go in and enter fake information for anyone?

Otherwise my takeaways from the call that need to be solved are how to:

1. set up a google form to populate a single spreadsheet of communication
information for each student,
2. make that spreadsheet available to all @ellabakerschool.edu accounts,
3. dynamically populate subsequent tabs for each class and group within
each class,
4. email each email address within each group and/or,
5. populate @ellabakerschool.edu account contacts with said groups
6. post a google doc on the website - to hold "weekly newsletters in
process" as well as a log of last week's newsletters.

If that sounds right I'll take a look! Oh, and I still have to formulate
all the info for fundraising. On it!
