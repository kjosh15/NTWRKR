Spoke to Carl yesterday - he rescheduled a day-of mtg last minute. Turns
out the contact Avery Dennison has had at Estee to date was aiming at
retirement and slowing adoption; Carl asked that I act as an intermediate
and pitch your solutions to Rob Peterson, the new head of Package
Engineering and R&D who reports directly to Carl. Carl was... very bullish.

Overall I'd say this is very good news. Carl was clear that there were
internal political reasons for the slow onramping of these solutions and
that better data infrastructure is critical to his plans for Estee, esp. as
we go forward in a new Covid reality.

I'd like your thoughts on how I can best play a role here; Carl knows me
well and seemed to want to have my involvement ongoing, but I don't want to
bottleneck anything Avery Dennison is going to deploy for Estee. Let me
know your thoughts, and I'll revert more when I hear back from Rob.

All best,
Josh
