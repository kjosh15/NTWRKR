I've established residency in Iceland as it enrolls us in world-class
healthcare for free, plus gets my kids access to schools and all kinds of
social services. It also means I'm exposed to tax liability here.

I've got some folks at PwC locally looking at whether I can use my LLC in
NYC for business expenses (meaning I would only have to pay personal taxes
in Iceland), but either way I'm going to be gone from NYC for 184 days or
more, which means I'm no longer a resident for purposes of personal taxes.
Is that correct to the best of your knowledge, and how does it affect the
rest of our planning?

Let me know if a quick call would be helpful!

best,
Josh
