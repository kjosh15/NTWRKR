We are very okay you guys. We have wildfires in areas near us, and we're
wearing masks for COVID, but we are healthy , and safe, and just fine. The
fires are further away from us than they have been in the past 3 years.
That's something. =F0=9F=98=9C

Shanti was here for a few days last week. His Step-mom, Raelynn, has
cancer. She was in the hospital and then came home.... basically, she's
home to die. She also lives in Santa Rosa, so we were able to visit with
him. Which reminds me, how's your Aunt Jill?

We got our monthly pictures from you, Hulda, of you both, the boys, and
your family in Iceland. You all look so wonderful! I know it's also hard
for you to be so far from all of us here, but I'm so glad you're in Iceland
and away from all this craziness, and safe.

Yvonne and I Love you so very very much,

Sharon
