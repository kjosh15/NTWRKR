Hi!
Three baby week and it=E2=80=99s taken me a bit to catch up.=20
I would be happy to share what I know and have experienced with =
Shamanism. It could be our topic. :) I=E2=80=99d be delighted to share =
with you and hear your connections
Although I have commitments, I=E2=80=99m off call though Monday the =
24th. We also will probably have a lull the following week, so safe to =
plan a phone call and probably not have to cancel last minute due to a =
labor.=20
And although the one hour convo works well for me and I know that we can =
fill that up effortlessly, I=E2=80=99d love to hear how you all are =
doing,
Barri
