Josh,

Erin Essenmacher suggested I reach out to you.  I=E2=80=99m not sure if =
you=E2=80=99ll remember me, but I interviewed you a couple times for =
NACD=E2=80=99s Cyber Course and produced the speaker intro for you for =
the 2018 Summit.  This email, unfortunately, has nothing to with those =
fun events.

Two days ago, my 16-year-old stepdaughter logged onto Omegle at the =
urging of some of her friends and ended up in the middle of a =
sextploitation scam.  We reported the situation immediately to the =
police and to the FBI, especially as she=E2=80=99s underage, but =
they=E2=80=99ve not been super helpful with the situation.  Yesterday, =
my husband=E2=80=99s ex-wife=E2=80=99s family was contacted by someone =
with a Palo Alto number saying unless they paid a ransom, this person =
would release pornographic images of my stepdaughter online. We reported =
that to law enforcement as well, but there hasn=E2=80=99t been anyone =
assigned to the case yet, so they won=E2=80=99t add any information to =
the initial police report and say we just need to wait until they call.

I=E2=80=99m looking for some advice as to next steps.  We=E2=80=99ve =
shut down internet at my husband=E2=80=99s ex-wife=E2=80=99s house until =
the security team from her company can come install a new VPN and =
enhanced security. We don=E2=80=99t want to wipe her computer, as it=E2=80=
=99s evidence if law enforcement ever get back to us.  We=E2=80=99ve =
taken her social media offline and are have the chip in her phone =
replaced and the number changed this afternoon.  Everyone around us has =
suggestions, but none are experts in this area.  My husband=E2=80=99s =
ex-wife reached out to a company called Digital Forensics and they=E2=80=99=
re doing a very hard sell to bring them on for many thousands of dollars =
so they can track the pedo who did this.  It=E2=80=99s unclear to me if =
that is even possible.

Would you have any advice for us?  Should we hire a company to backtrack =
and attempt to trace the criminals?  Should we hire you (or someone like =
you) to help us?  Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciate.

Kind Regards,
Lynn
