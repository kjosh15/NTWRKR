; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were waiting on the other for feed=
back... (!!)<br><br>Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring opt=
ions! I think there&#39;s a few constraints we need to note up front, and m=
ay have to take things in stages, but that we ought to start with what coul=
d work best for all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;m going to put out eve=
rything we know here first (so we both know exactly what we&#39;re talking =
about) and then offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re managing three big th=
ings:<br><br>1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a frie=
nd interested in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know mor=
e about this later today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t pan out then we&#39;=
d love to have you take them; as we understand it there&#39;s no quarantine=
 requirements in either Washington state nor NYC (see <a href=3D"https://ww=
w.portseattle.org/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://www.portseattle.org=
/node/11309</a> under &quot;What are the quarantine guidelines following tr=
avel?&quot; &gt; &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said, it&#39;s likely y=
ou&#39;d have to find a place for you and your son to stay at least a night=
 in Seattle before heading back. If you&#39;re going anyway you might as we=
ll visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!<br=
><br>If you&#39;re still interested in this, we&#39;d have to figure out wh=
at&#39;s needed for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which w=
e think should work for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I th=
ink we&#39;d have to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but =
have a friend that we can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Shipping stuff. Near =
term, we&#39;re having boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the house, =
and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#39;=
d need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then we c=
an buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on the boxes before =
pickup.<br><br>Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items packed=
 up for storage (books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn&#39;t a huge =
amount of this, and the good news is that if we can work things out for a l=
onger term arrangement it would basically be giving you back a lot of space=
 while leaving everything you need to run the home.<br><br>3) The lease. We=
&#39;re still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they&#39;re required=
 by law to give us one at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their heels =
(probably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I&#39;m goi=
ng to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month). =
Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electricity): $100<br>Nation=
al Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance): $16<br>Time Warner=
 Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br><br><br>Here are so=
me potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the cats=
, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as I&#39;d rather spare you the err=
and + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you can fly them to Seattl=
e we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or wh=
oever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a ton of cash either s=
o would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else is most price effective. W=
e&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers or whatever the cats need, of co=
urse, and probably have a friend that can take them to the vet in advance.<=
br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;d be more than happy to have you=
 stay at our place for September if you can help us get everything packed u=
p. No need to pay for anything other than utilities for this month as we&#3=
9;re having the money come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we&#39;d b=
oth be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!<br><br>C) If we ca=
n get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if you could pay $500 =
plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move somewhe=
re else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but that&#39;s a br=
idge several months away yet and we&#39;re happy to negotiate that when we =
get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know what you think about the above, an=
d sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#39;d put everything in writing s=
o we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - right now certainty is in short s=
upply! As you said in our call today we&#39;re both looking for a win/win h=
ere, so feel free to suggest anything, ask anything, or give feedback to ad=
just any of the above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=
