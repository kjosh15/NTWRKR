Great news! We're also really excited to have someone who can help us get
our personal items all packed and ready for storage. We should have someone
who can take the cats to Seattle later, with Sonali taking them starting in
Sept. Let us know when you're available to chat and compare notes!

; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were waiting on the other for feed=
back... (!!)<br><br>Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring opt=
ions! I think there&#39;s a few constraints we need to note up front, and m=
ay have to take things in stages, but that we ought to start with what coul=
d work best for all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;m going to put out eve=
rything we know here first (so we both know exactly what we&#39;re talking =
about) and then offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re managing three big th=
ings:<br><br>1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a frie=
nd interested in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know mor=
e about this later today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t pan out then we&#39;=
d love to have you take them; as we understand it there&#39;s no quarantine=
 requirements in either Washington state nor NYC (see <a href=3D"https://ww=
w.portseattle.org/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://www.portseattle.org=
/node/11309</a> under &quot;What are the quarantine guidelines following tr=
avel?&quot; &gt; &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said, it&#39;s likely y=
ou&#39;d have to find a place for you and your son to stay at least a night=
 in Seattle before heading back. If you&#39;re going anyway you might as we=
ll visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!<br=
><br>If you&#39;re still interested in this, we&#39;d have to figure out wh=
at&#39;s needed for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which w=
e think should work for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I th=
ink we&#39;d have to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but =
have a friend that we can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Shipping stuff. Near =
term, we&#39;re having boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the house, =
and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#39;=
d need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then we c=
an buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on the boxes before =
pickup.<br><br>Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items packed=
 up for storage (books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn&#39;t a huge =
amount of this, and the good news is that if we can work things out for a l=
onger term arrangement it would basically be giving you back a lot of space=
 while leaving everything you need to run the home.<br><br>3) The lease. We=
&#39;re still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they&#39;re required=
 by law to give us one at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their heels =
(probably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I&#39;m goi=
ng to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month). =
Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electricity): $100<br>Nation=
al Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance): $16<br>Time Warner=
 Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br><br><br>Here are so=
me potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the cats=
, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as I&#39;d rather spare you the err=
and + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you can fly them to Seattl=
e we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or wh=
oever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a ton of cash either s=
o would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else is most price effective. W=
e&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers or whatever the cats need, of co=
urse, and probably have a friend that can take them to the vet in advance.<=
br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;d be more than happy to have you=
 stay at our place for September if you can help us get everything packed u=
p. No need to pay for anything other than utilities for this month as we&#3=
9;re having the money come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we&#39;d b=
oth be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!<br><br>C) If we ca=
n get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if you could pay $500 =
plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move somewhe=
re else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but that&#39;s a br=
idge several months away yet and we&#39;re happy to negotiate that when we =
get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know what you think about the above, an=
d sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#39;d put everything in writing s=
o we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - right now certainty is in short s=
upply! As you said in our call today we&#39;re both looking for a win/win h=
ere, so feel free to suggest anything, ask anything, or give feedback to ad=
just any of the above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=
