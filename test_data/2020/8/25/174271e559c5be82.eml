No question about it, Margaret, you were way ahead of your time. SHARP was
way ahead of its time. The Medici Effect is almost doctrine for me now with
Polyplexus. It also might be ahead of its time, but wasn't our job to be
ahead of our time? Usually, when something's time comes, I'm bored with it,
anyway.

So yeah. Hop in and have fun.  I published some of the notable results of
Part II on Medium (see my FB Page) and here's the link to Part 3.  I'd love
to see SHARPIES tear it up.

This is just the first time and topic I felt safe unleashing them on.

I need to look up, The Difference.

But get in there and have fun.  There's a training session on Friday at
Noon your time, but I doubt you'd really need it.  Our, sort-of-live event
is at 1-3 EST.  I'm thinking of doing a live Simulstream if there's any
interest.
