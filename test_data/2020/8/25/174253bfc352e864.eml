Jay,

First off I hope you and yours are doing well in the midst of the pandemic.
Now more than ever we need the work you're doing at QZ!

Secondly, I've spent the last few years building a platform that
statistically models belief and behaviors in organizations, based on the
org's core values. We saw a 10x increase in growth when COVID-19 hit, based
firstly on a need to provide employees with useful feedback, and secondly
on a growing realization that culture really does eat strategy for
breakfast - and that nobody knew how to measure it.

I'm curious if your staff would like to try it out (for free) to get an
idea of what our glorious new metriced future looks like. Companies in
every major vertical are starting to gather data about their employees -
some of it is terrible, but a lot of it is really re-shaping the future of
the companies that are using it. Internally, eating our own dogfood has
radically rebuilt my view of how companies are going to work going forward.

Let me know if it's worth a brief call to discuss!

- J
