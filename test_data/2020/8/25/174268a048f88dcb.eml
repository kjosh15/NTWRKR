Hey! 

How it life under pandemic treating me? Let's just say that this is the
first moment I've had in... two weeks? Two and a half?... to check my
e-mail and leave it at that. :) 

Sorry I didn't see this earlier. I'm not sure who I'd have suggested,
though. Not me, anyway. I am very much keen to stay off of airplanes
until there is a vaccine, though it would have been nice to see you guys
however briefly and meet your kids.

I hope you found someone to help. Stay safe! 

Jason

We have an empty apartment in NYC, and can buy tickets for two folks who want to go to NYC for a few days before bringing the cats back with them. WA is one of the few states NOT on the quarantine list for NYC, so you could just show up and as long as you wear a mask (the same way you would in SEA) you can do as you like. Do you have anyone you'd trust/recommend who might be interested? We're keen to get them to Seattle before the end of the month.
