Sweets,

I calculated the price of shopping via USPS with an $500 estimated value
per box:

20x20x16, 29 lbs $332.85
20x20x16, 33 lbs $332.85
20x20x16, 37 lbs $332.85
20x20x16, 53 lbs $406.50
19x14x7, 19lbs $107.55 Priority Mail 6-10 business days

$1,512.6 total

I'm looking into ship/air freight as an alternative now. By way of
comparison, I got an estimate for a pallet of 12 boxes at 50lbs each for
about that price via air freight.

xoxo,
Josh
