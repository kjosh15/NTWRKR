Wow! Back to the land of 1200 hours of annual sunshine! Is that a
permanent move, or just until there's a COVID vaccine? 

As for me: I'm working at Oracle these days, which is an evolution
through two acquisitions of the job I had at Voicebox Technologies a
while back. Notionally, I'm a developer (ha. Oracle's set of approved
job titles is not very broad) but in reality I'm the "data guy" on our
team. We got acquired by Oracle about a year and a half ago to do speech
recognition for their digital assistant platform. Speech reco is machine
learning, and ML is all about collecting data. So mostly that's what I
do. It's a different gig than I've had in a long time, but I enjoy it
and it feels good to actively contribute to a product rather than just
writing about the product. 

I'm still writing every November, though finding the time to polish and
publish the results is a lot harder. Someday. Maybe by the time your
boys are old enough for middle grade adventures I'll have some ready.

We have an empty apartment in NYC, and can buy tickets for two folks who want to go to NYC for a few days before bringing the cats back with them. WA is one of the few states NOT on the quarantine list for NYC, so you could just show up and as long as you wear a mask (the same way you would in SEA) you can do as you like. Do you have anyone you'd trust/recommend who might be interested? We're keen to get them to Seattle before the end of the month.
