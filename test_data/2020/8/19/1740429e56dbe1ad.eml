Hi Josh! I appreciate your care about this situation and for being in
possibility with me to make this work for all. I am with you in the options
and I say yes to the options and possible scenarios above. I am taking it
one day at a time. so much uncertainty now a days and doing our best to
cruise through it in an empowered way. What I can add at the moment is that
it would be helpful if by the end of this week we can have more clarity as
to what needs to happen with your cats. also, if we can confirm for my son
and I to move in, say September 1st? Clearly, I am agreeing with what you
presented above. I look forward to hearing from you and continuing to
create support around what's needed for you and your family and mine. thank
you again. I really appreciate this kind of transparent and sincere
exchange. I am grateful for you and your wife presenting something that may
work for all of us.
In best regards,
Gustavo

 having boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the house, and have a spre=
adsheet listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#39;d need to have =
that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then we can buy shipping=
 and have the labels sent to you to put on the boxes before pickup.<br><br>=
Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items packed up for storage=

 us one at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their heels (probably hopin=

to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month). Other monthly h=
