Awesome. Stoked we're able to continue to build on something that works for
all of us. Some updates:

- We may have a lead on someone who can take the cats to Seattle next week.
Still confirming.
- Otherwise, Sonali mentioned possibly taking the cats for a time.
- Lastly, I'm negotiating with the landlord about the lease now, so will
hopefully know more soon about what is possible post-Sept.

If it's ok with you, we'll confirm handoff of the apartment to you Sept. 1
with Sonali pending the cats' departure. Then we can coordinate about stuff
to get packed and what plans would work post-Sept (pending our negotiations
with the landlord). Does that work?

Gratefully,
Josh
