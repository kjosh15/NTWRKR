Short answer: no. Windows RDP is famous as a security vulnerability, and
that liquid turned it on without notifying us - or doing even the most
preliminary security such as two factor, permission limiting, shifting
ports, and requiring VPN to connect speaks volumes. I=E2=80=99d suggest you=
 send
them the above article and ask them which solutions they=E2=80=99re putting=
 in
place. After that, though, we need to think more seriously about our tech
strategy. I=E2=80=99m thinking that getting some dev help may be too on our=
 list
after we ramp up Bechtel!
