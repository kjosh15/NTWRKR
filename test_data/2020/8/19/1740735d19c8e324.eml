Carl,

Absolute pleasure to talk to you today! I hope you don't mind if I loop
back in a month about reconnecting, strictly in the interest of staying in
touch and offering support. As usual, I left our call with several topics
in mind:

- Rob Peterson sounds like the right person at Estee to talk about RFID
with. I saw you intro'd us and will set up a time to walk him through Avery
Dennison's offering.

- Let me loop back around with the supplier of the UVC light sanitation
offering; I want to make certain they can deliver at scale before I ask you
to engage further.

- Do let me know if your daughter wants to talk further about F212. I've
been a guest at their holiday parties for the last decade; ever since I
took a desk there while in graduate school.

- In the meantime I looked up Vivek Murthy reg. his book on loneliness - if
you think it'd be mutually beneficial I'd love to connect! I'm really
curious to hear what he thinks about the possibilities for intentionally
designing virtualized support structures to be fully responsive to COVID
and related mobility-oriented challenges. Your point about voice being
richer than text (and presumably video being richer than voice) may present
some really interesting opportunities going forward.

All best wishes,
Josh
