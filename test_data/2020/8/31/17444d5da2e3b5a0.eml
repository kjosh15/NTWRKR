Spoke to Rob, and the short version is he has staff looking into this stuff
but definitely thought there was room to fill in some gaps for their
strategy (esp. at the back end - tracking inventory from factory on, and
front end - in store.) He's keen to check in with his team and set up a
call to learn more.

That's the good news. The bad news is he wants to check with a guy named
Chris Clark, which IIR is the contact you've already been struggling to
move forward with. Rob wanted to see how familiar Chris was with your
product line and then set up a time to review the solutions Avery Dennison
has before deciding where/how to move forward.

Loop me in on your experience with Chris Clark (if any) and we'll figure
out next steps.

- J

P.S. Abridged notes from the call:

tracking/tracing of interest to them
have a lot of pilots in place
haven't settled on one tech yet
still looking at a number of things
he's got a team working on this space right now
their plan is to make the tracking more wholistic
he wants to connect me w/ Chris Clark
he's leading whole track and trace; tagging and other tech for tracking end
to end
front end, in store is part of strategy - omnichannel
that fits how to create more omnichannel for the consumer
-
Next steps:
he'll check in with Chris Clark to see how familiar he is with Avery
Dennison
then he'll set up a call w/ Chris, myself, and Rob
