Glad to hear you=E2=80=99re all hanging in there, and Amen on wtf the 10th!=
 Good
you got to take leave during the worst of things; we left mid-June and it
sounds like things have been improving ever since. And I don=E2=80=99t beli=
eve a
word of your being a terrible homeschool teacher; where else would the boys
learn such insouciant wit?!?

We=E2=80=99re planning to stay abroad until the new year; Iceland had 6 cas=
es
yesterday (all in quarantine already) and is doing very good governance
(aka =E2=80=9Ctrack and trace=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctesting=E2=80=9D) so th=
ere is good reason to believe
it=E2=80=99ll be gone from Iceland entirely by October. Beyond that my in-l=
aws are
turning out to be pretty good housemates (as in they travel a lot) and the
local school has accepted the boys, so they=E2=80=99ll be doing lots of woo=
d shop,
swimming, and singing dirges / Icelandic folk songs.

For our part I=E2=80=99m continuing to double down on financial risk in pur=
suing my
startup. Because a pandemic wasn=E2=80=99t risky enough.

Really curious to hear your take on NYC; how is it feeling right now and
what do you think is going to happen once the eviction moratoriums are
lifted and the federal stimulus ends? I.e., are these the end times for the
urban center, or are we going to see a
revitalization of what we hold dear about the big city?

All best to the family,
Josh
