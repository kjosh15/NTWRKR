eight-part series that examines the advanced technologies being developed a=
round the world to save earth&#39;s coldest locales from melting as well as=
 the rest of the planet from the ever-approaching climate catastrophe. Usin=
g Iceland=E2=80=99s glaciers and the broader landscape of the country as a =
recoccuring visual example of how climate change is impacting our world, Sa=
ving Iceland will venture to the far pockets of the globe to unearth resear=
ch being done to save all of Earth=E2=80=99s coldest lands.</i></div><div><=
br></div><div>Next steps would be to craft a one-sheet. Then if there=E2=80=
=99s committed interest, a treatment.</div><div><br></div><div>But as it ta=
kes time and money to craft such things, we=E2=80=99d need confirmation of =
interest and to discuss finer details for each step in the process.</div><d=

hearing back.</div><div><br></div><div>Tks,</div><div>Matt</div></div></div=
