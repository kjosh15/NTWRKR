"No new Covid-19 cases were detected domestically yesterday. This is the
first time in three weeks that no infection is detected from sampling in
this country. 64 are in isolation after being diagnosed with a domestic
infection and their number has decreased by five since yesterday.

Nobody is in hospital with COVID-19. The incidence of domestic infections
in Iceland is 16.4. The incidence is the total number of infections in the
last 14 days per 100,000 inhabitants.

Two people were diagnosed at the border, but both travelers are waiting for
antibody tests to check for an active infection."

We're in the right spot. :)

xoxo,
Josh
