I have not worked with Chris Clark directly and had some mixed feedback
both positive and negative. My gut feel is right now we have a good
position with Chris however it is on slightly unsure footing. Bob Pernice
has been the primary connection to Chris and seems positive on the current
state of that relationship. I think it would be good to connect you and Bob
sooner than later... maybe we can target Wednesday to introduce you more
directly to our team.

Great info - thanks for the follow up
