If you're into drinking I guess you're set. Maybe it's time to get all
Hemmingway and produce that famous novel?

Discombobulated AF is a good summary. Our kids start school locally on
Tuesday and remotely two weeks later, and we'll juggle both until we settle
into something that works for them until/unless covid causes schools here
to close. We're still staying with my in-laws, which is ok for me but is
slowly causing my wife to lose her mind. I'm continuing to claim that
plentiful zoom relationships are totally fulfilling my social needs, aside
from creeping depression every morning. So yes, confusing.

The good news is that there is an "end" of sorts in sight by early next
year (i.e., vaccines + global policies); that it may not include the United
States is an added wrinkle. Do you know anyone in Berlin? That's our second
choice if NYC remains a bad option to return to...

And yourself? I've been talking to Paul Bennet (he also moved to Iceland)
and it sounds like IDEO got kicked in the teeth by the pandemic. How's that
working out, what are your contingency plans, and what's your world-burning
plot??

All best wishes,
Josh
