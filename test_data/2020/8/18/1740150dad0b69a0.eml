Amazing!!!! This is super exciting to hear; despite all the horrors we've
seen recently, this is definitely an illustration of the physical mobility
we've been under-exploiting as knowledge workers. Excited to hear how
things go.

Also and FWIW, if you want really good mobile wifi you should come to
Iceland; I regularly get 90MBs ... on my cell phone. In the bottom of a
fjord. Of course, the weather isn't quite as nice as French Polynesia, but
it IS beautiful... ;)

Keep me posted, and best of luck!
