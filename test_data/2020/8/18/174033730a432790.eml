Masterfully managed meeting; really nice to see such clued-in management
around a potentially thorny issue.

For next steps, given that Valerie is going to vacation is it our best bet
to reconvene after your email blast, or did you want to make a list of next
steps / things to investigate based on the notes on the doc you shared?

best,
Josh
