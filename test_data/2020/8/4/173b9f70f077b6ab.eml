Just got off the call w/ their CTO and a couple of his direct reports. They
had two needs; one was to measure people's opinions on returning to offices
(and related productivity) and another was around a problem they have with
their product managers not adopting more agile processes (that's my take -
all they said was they had problems with their PMs).

They had good questions and seemed inclined to use our data in conjunction
with other data sets they were gathering, but their next step was to a)
isolate the value prop internally, and b) socialize it with other leaders.

That last bit makes me really wish we had a sexy deck, but does point to
the idea that internal stakeholders beyond our champion are additional good
targets.

best,
Josh

P.S. Unless you think I shouldn't I'm going to share the above on the slack
channel to inform next steps with BSS!
