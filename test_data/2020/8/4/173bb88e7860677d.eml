Talked to a friend building a company using a notation for collaboration
developed in Stanford - basically a linguistic model for how collaboration
happens in small teams. Maps very well to virtual teams as you have both
separate audio and text transcripts. Wanted to know if we could
collaborate... and unsuprisingly we=E2=80=99re hoping we could bring the cl=
ients.
Still, an interesting offer. Might sweeten the pot with clients like
Motorola.

More Thursday,
Josh
