Smari,

A couple interesting things:

1) Estonia has announced they're doing 1 year digital nomad visas (DNV)
with no restrictions on country of origin.

https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/faqs-about-estonias-digital-nomad-visa-=
b04f12551e30

At the moment, you can't go straight from the US to Estonia, but there are
intermediary countries you could get to, quarantine there for 2 weeks, and
then go on to Estonia.

Or... Georgia <https://nomadflag.com/tbilisi-georgia/> is soon launching
its digital nomad visa <
https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/georgia-digital-visa>.

If you wanted to integrate more external networks into Iceland you could do
worse than leveraging Iceland's relative safety with the technorati.

2) Getting interim health insurance in Iceland is cheap and easy... and
doesn't cover Covid. I'm having to buy travel medical insurance for ~$1500
USD to supplement. WTF.
