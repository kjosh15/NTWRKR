have been busy for Eric and I as we are taking full advantage of being able=
 to finally travel around the majestic country of Ireland. Our first advent=
ure was a train ride to Galway for a long weekend.&nbsp; We were greeted by=
 a torrential rain storm but managed to find our way to the hotel and then =
to a lovely dinner right around the corner which delighted us with local oy=
sters and a white chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce reminiscent of Caf=
=C3=A9 Langley (for my island friends!).&nbsp; We took a boat ride up the C=
orrib River to Lake Corrib passing dilapidated castles overgrown with ivy a=
nd a myriad of avian life including swan families.&nbsp; We then grabbed so=
me lunch and went to Eyre Square where we were accosted by a very aggressiv=
e seagull intent on stealing bites of our pizza.&nbsp; This audacious seagu=
ll would fly into the back of your head attempting to knock the food out of=
 your mouth or hand.&nbsp; We enjoyed the buskers as we walked down Quay St=
reet and we kicked the wall at the end of the Salthill Promenade as is trad=
ition. The next day we took a beautiful bus ride down to the indescribably =
stunning Cliffs of Moher.&nbsp; The Atlantic Coast of Ireland has an incred=
ible and varied landscape all partitioned with a series of stone walls. We =
are excited to return to Galway again soon when the pubs are open and live =
music returns to inside venues!</p><p class=3DMsoNormal style=3D'mso-margin=

 by going to a Mexican Restaurant in Dublin called Salsas which has the spe=

olved taking our bicycles along on a train to Waterford.&nbsp; Straight fro=
m the train we rode our bikes to the river ferry to Waterford Castle which =
is on an island in the River Suir.&nbsp; The ferry was pulled across the ri=
ver by cables and took about 5 minutes for the entire trip.&nbsp; At first =
the staff was a bit confused by our arrival by bicycle but they were incred=
ibly gracious and stored our bikes in one of their offices.&nbsp; The castl=
e was beautiful and we spent our time gorging on amazing meals and walking =
the island=E2=80=99s perimeter.&nbsp; We also were finally far enough away =
from the lights of the city to see the Neowise comet which made Eric very h=
appy! </p><p class=3DMsoNormal style=3D'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-=

Waterford city, so we got there way before our check-in time for our next h=
otel.&nbsp; While we waited for 3:00 to roll around, we walked to the Water=
ford Nature park along the river which afforded us a great panoramic view o=
f the city.&nbsp; The hotel we stayed at had a pool and we got to go swimmi=
ng for the first time in months!!!&nbsp; I just read a book called, <i>The =
Immortal Irishman</i>, about Thomas Francis Meagher who was bourn in Waterf=
ord.&nbsp; It was fun exploring the city and seeing the blue plaques, statu=
es and memorabilia associated with Meagher.&nbsp; He was one of the main ba=
ckers of the orange, white and green Irish Flag and the first to raise it b=
efore being banished to Van Diemen=E2=80=99s Land from which he escaped end=

 Waterford Greenway, a 46km bike path that stretches from Waterford city to=
 Dungarven on the coast.&nbsp; At this point I need to mention how amazing =
of a human my husband Eric is.&nbsp; First of all, he got some pannier (sad=
dle) bags for his bike and carried most of our things which I am so gratefu=
l for.&nbsp; But more importantly even after over two decades together, he =
still pushes me to be a better person, I truly did not think before we move=
d here that I would ever bike again, much less go on a 90+ km trip over two=
 days. The Greenway was amazing, the first segment was a leisurely ride nex=
t to the river, then through beautiful countryside, over a couple of viaduc=
ts and through the coolest tunnel I=E2=80=99ve ever seen in my life complet=
e with hundreds of kid made fairy doors and finally a spectacular view of t=
he southern coast.&nbsp; We stayed a night in Dungarven in a hotel which al=
so had a pool <span style=3D'font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji",sans-serif'>&#128=

ck was a little more challenging, not just because my butt was already sore=
