I just read that the ravens are getting bored in the absence of normal
tourist traffic; I helped develop a device for autonomously training crows
to drop in coins in exchange for peanuts, and would love to work with you
to make one strong enough for the ravens to play with. More info is in my T=
ED
talk
<https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_a_thought_experiment_on_the_intelli=
gence_of_crows>,
or at the project website <http://www.thecrowbox.com> at www.thecrowbox.com=
.

If the amount of time and attention our boxes get from crows is any
indication, they ought to keep the ravens busy for quite some time - and
may provide a new, distanced way for the ravens to interact with the public=
!

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Josh Klein
