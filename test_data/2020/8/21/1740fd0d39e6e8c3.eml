Just wanted to make sure we had Sonali in the loop and ready to take the
cats - I'm happy to have you both move in on Sept. 1! Are you in touch with
her?

That said, why don't we do a quick call today/Monday to make sure we're
clear on our commitments to each other and so we can give you an update on
the cats' move, the lease, steps to be taken in the apartment, etc.?

All best,
Josh

for 6 months (so $1,125/month). Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>Con=
Ed (electricity): $100<br>National Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;=
s insurance): $16<br>Time Warner Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $=
201/month<br><br><br>Here are some potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF=
 can fly in and pick up the cats, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as =
I&#39;d rather spare you the errand + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t wor=
k, if you can fly them to Seattle we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket =
for yourself and your son (or whoever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#=
39;t have a ton of cash either so would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever=
 else is most price effective. We&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers =
or whatever the cats need, of course, and probably have a friend that can t=
ake them to the vet in advance.<br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;=
d be more than happy to have you stay at our place for September if you can=
 help us get everything packed up. No need to pay for anything other than u=
tilities for this month as we&#39;re having the money come out of our depos=
it anyway and frankly we&#39;d both be doing each other a favor. That shoul=
d be enough!!<br><br>C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d=
 be happy if you could pay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds l=
ike you may want to move somewhere else in the new year, and we may want to=
 move back - but that&#39;s a bridge several months away yet and we&#39;re =
happy to negotiate that when we get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know wh=
at you think about the above, and sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#=
39;d put everything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - r=
ight now certainty is in short supply! As you said in our call today we&#39=
;re both looking for a win/win here, so feel free to suggest anything, ask =
anything, or give feedback to adjust any of the above.<br><br>Looking forwa=
