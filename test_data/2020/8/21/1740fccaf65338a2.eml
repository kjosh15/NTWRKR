Lynn,

I'm so sorry this happened!! At this point the perpetrators don't seem to
have attacked anyone's computer, so I don't think defensive measures (VPNs,
etc.) are especially necessary (although always sensible!) If you're
interested in adding additional safety measures the EFF has excellent
guides here: https://ssd.eff.org/en

The real concern is that your ex-wife (and stepdaughter) are being
blackmailed. If your stepdaughter *did* share pictures of herself then
there is a reasonable risk that they'll be shared online whether you pay or
not. The problem is that tracing the perpetrators is likely to be a very
difficult task if they've taken any reasonable precautions. For example, it
sounds like they're using Google Voice to place calls, and it wouldn't be
hard for them to have connected to the Omegle site using an anonymized
connection. Omegle has clear warnings on their site that under-18's can
only use it with parental guidance, so they're unlikely to want to get
involved either, and it's unclear if they'd even have data that could be
helpful if they did.

That said, hiring a company to attempt to track the criminals seems like
your best option beyond ignoring the threats. The pictures are likely of
very limited value on their own (there's plenty of underage porn on the
internet), but letting it go is obviously a deeply personal issue.

Again, I'm so sorry this happened to your family. Any qualified research
firm should be able to help attempt to trace the criminals if that's the
route you decide to take going forward; if you need them I'm happy to ask
around for recommendations.

All best wishes,
Josh
