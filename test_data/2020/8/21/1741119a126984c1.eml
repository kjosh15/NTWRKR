Hi Josh,

It was nice chatting last week. I finished the short film I was working =
a few days ago and have begun thinking about the climate change series =
we discussed.

I need a few more days to put thoughts together on this. So I=E2=80=99ll =
be back with you soon with some lines.

Have a great weekend,
Matt
