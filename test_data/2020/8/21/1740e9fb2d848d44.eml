of the apartment to you Sept. 1." ?

for the month of September. starting september 1st.  thank you again.

 for the slow reply; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were waiting on=
 the other for feedback... (!!)<br><br>Really appreciate your open-mindedne=
ss in exploring options! I think there&#39;s a few constraints we need to n=
ote up front, and may have to take things in stages, but that we ought to s=
tart with what could work best for all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;m g=
oing to put out everything we know here first (so we both know exactly what=
 we&#39;re talking about) and then offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re ma=
naging three big things:<br><br>1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have=
 a friend of a friend interested in coming from Seattle and then returning;=
 we should know more about this later today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t p=
an out then we&#39;d love to have you take them; as we understand it there&=
#39;s no quarantine requirements in either Washington state nor NYC (see <a=
 href=3D"https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://=
www.portseattle.org/node/11309</a> under &quot;What are the quarantine guid=
elines following travel?&quot; &gt; &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said=
, it&#39;s likely you&#39;d have to find a place for you and your son to st=
ay at least a night in Seattle before heading back. If you&#39;re going any=
way you might as well visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainfo=
rests a little!!<br><br>If you&#39;re still interested in this, we&#39;d ha=
ve to figure out what&#39;s needed for you to fly with them; we have two so=
ft carriers which we think should work for flying with them under your seat=
s on Jet Blue. I think we&#39;d have to have them taken to the vet a week b=
efore you fly, but have a friend that we can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Sh=
ipping stuff. Near term, we&#39;re having boxes and vacuum packing bags shi=
pped to the house, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to ha=
ve shipped. We&#39;d need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes=
 weighed, then we can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put o=
n the boxes before pickup.<br><br>Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our pe=
rsonal items packed up for storage (books, pictures, stuff like that). Ther=
e isn&#39;t a huge amount of this, and the good news is that if we can work=
 things out for a longer term arrangement it would basically be giving you =
back a lot of space while leaving everything you need to run the home.<br><=
br>3) The lease. We&#39;re still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - t=
hey&#39;re required by law to give us one at this point, but they&#39;re dr=
agging their heels (probably hoping things work out legislatively in their =
favor). I&#39;m going to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months =
(so $1,125/month). Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electrici=
ty): $100<br>National Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance):=
 $16<br>Time Warner Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br>=
<br><br>Here are some potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in a=
nd pick up the cats, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as I&#39;d rathe=
r spare you the errand + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you can=
 fly them to Seattle we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket for yourself =
and your son (or whoever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a t=
on of cash either so would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else is most=
 price effective. We&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers or whatever t=
he cats need, of course, and probably have a friend that can take them to t=
he vet in advance.<br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;d be more tha=
n happy to have you stay at our place for September if you can help us get =
everything packed up. No need to pay for anything other than utilities for =
this month as we&#39;re having the money come out of our deposit anyway and=
 frankly we&#39;d both be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!=
<br><br>C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if =
you could pay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may w=
ant to move somewhere else in the new year, and we may want to move back - =
but that&#39;s a bridge several months away yet and we&#39;re happy to nego=
tiate that when we get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know what you think =
about the above, and sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#39;d put ever=
ything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - right now cert=
ainty is in short supply! As you said in our call today we&#39;re both look=
ing for a win/win here, so feel free to suggest anything, ask anything, or =
give feedback to adjust any of the above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Josh<b=
