Chris,

Just checking back in to see how you all are doing in the middle of all the
craziness! I've been working with some pharma and insurance companies and
developing my thinking around the CGM opportunity. Let me know what you're
up to these days, if I can be of any help, and/or if it'd be worthwhile to
have a brief call to compare notes!

All best wishes,
Josh
