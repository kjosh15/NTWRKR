&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that this implementation has all the bells and wh=
istles turned on, so it looks a bit busy. Again, we&#39;re white labeling t=
he platform in order to work with partners who can convey and mobilize the =
value of the data, to the point that if you don&#39;t like our front end yo=
u&#39;re free to write your own and simply submit results via our API. Note=
 also that values are completely configurable, so if you want to track more=
 specific behavior (in line with your growing learning portfolio) that&#39;=
s easy to do.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Take a look and let me know when next week would be be=
st to reconnect. And remember, no iPad until after 4pm!! ;D<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello buddy,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Great to hear from you. Iceland, smart choice.=
 Pretty much anywhere but the US right now...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes deffo. Would be great to catch up. Has bee=
n too long. We, like most of our clients, have had to do a bit of a pivot b=
ut the reality is there&#39;s just not enough liquid cash out there just no=
w. Most businesses are sitting, like Scrooge McDuck, on their piles of cash=
 waiting for the storm to pass. Doom and gloom aside, there are some super =
interesting opportunity areas and we&#39;re treating it as an opportunity t=
o simplify our approach and get the business super tight.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How are you fixed next week? Tuesday?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#39;re in Iceland now, so an easier tim=

connect for a brief call to see how/if we can help each other. Most of my c=
