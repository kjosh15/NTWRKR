Just checking in to see how you're doing, how life is progressing in the
middle of the US insanity, and / or if I can be of any help.

We're settling in nicely in Iceland, and I'm growing my EU network while
we're here. Plenty of solid growth on IndigoMetrics, which is rewarding.
Hit me if it's worth a quick call to compare notes!

Hope you and yours are well,
Josh
