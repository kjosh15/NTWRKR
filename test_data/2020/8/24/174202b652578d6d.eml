How's life in the pandemic treating you? Here's hoping you and yours are
well and healthy!

We're settling in nicely to life in Iceland; it's super interesting to see
how far we can push virtualization on social fronts, but overall not
enormously disruptive. Most of all it's interesting to see how business and
innovation is progressing in the US vs the EU - I'd be curious to hear your
thoughts on how to best capitalize on the differences in development we're
likely to see going forward!

All best,
Josh
