Hi Josh,

Good news.

I am cc. Kidda and Steinarr, my partners in crime for projects like this. I
am meeting them tomorrow morning and will discuss it with them then and
write back to you after that. How is tomorrow at 11am for you if we would
have time for a quick zoom call?

Best,

Anna Hildur
