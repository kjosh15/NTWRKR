BTW, I didn't know you'd taught at  Bifr=C3=B6st University! Curious how yo=
u
liked it; I'm keen to see if I can help play a role there this fall/spring.
Also, I enjoyed reading about your work on consumer rights here in Iceland.
I'm trying to build my network here in Iceland now and expect this topic
will come up sooner rather than later...

All the best,
Josh
