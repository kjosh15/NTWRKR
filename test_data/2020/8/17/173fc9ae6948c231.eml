After 15 years in Jackson Heights our two cats (Rexy and Bastet) are going
to WA to stay with my sister until we can get back home. Do you have any
experience making certificates of health so they can fly, and is there
anything you=E2=80=99d recommend to help them do so more comfortably? We=E2=
=80=99re hoping
to have them picked up and on a plane next week!!

Hope you=E2=80=99re all doing well,
Josh
