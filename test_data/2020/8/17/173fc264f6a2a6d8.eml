I spoke to Laura and her business partner on Friday and so far things seem
to be looking good. Notably, they want everyone except for the HODs to be
local, so there's a possibility of employing a lot of Icelanders! They had
three big asks:

1. They need a line manager to talk to about #=E2=80=99s. I couldn't cover =
this
myself, and Laura's business partner clearly wants to dig into costs. Is
this something you could do, and if not who do you suggest?

2. They need pics/specs of spaces available here. They'd prefer not to have
to soundproof something themselves - and any construction they'd have to do
just adds to the cost - but based on their research all the big sound
stages are already taken through the end of the year. How can we get some
suggestions to them?

3. Any info on insurance in time of Covid a huge deciding factor. I had
*no* idea where/how to get this information to them as AFAIK the big
insurers are simply not covering anything Covid-related. Do you know
otherwise?

My impression is that they're hungry to get this project started ASAP. If
we can present them with a few location options they may be amenable to
signing something with a paycheck for us attached to it. Thoughts?
