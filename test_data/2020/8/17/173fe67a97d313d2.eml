Thank you for the update. I=E2=80=99ll ask around, but I=E2=80=99m thinking=
 a Lyft might be
easiest.
Also, I just got off the phone with the vet. They will need a health
certificate with verification of current rabies vaccine that is completed
no more than 10 days from the flight.
I hope that information helps.
