Thanks for sending this; these are all good points. And I can see how I may
miss the diversity from the US; especially in Iceland (where the only
significant ethnic minority is Polish) and the genetic homogeneity is just
massive... But more importantly the *culture* of diversity is what I
suspect I will miss. Being open to and encouraging of different views and
experiences; is that part of the diversity you're referring to? Either way,
I think you're absolutely correct about how diversity plays out in the USA
as an economically fueled process of exploitation.

In many ways I'm trying to understand the shape of my own privilege while
grasping for the discomfort and growth that comes from it in terms of said
diversity. As you said, the only real alternative to walling ourselves off
in a gated community is to try to teach our kids to struggle in the real
world while aspiring for something better, and I felt like that's a lot of
what I appreciated about NYC. My neighborhood in Jackson Heights was the
most diverse in the USA, and everyday encounters were constantly fraught
with the ongoing negotiation of same

One incident stands out in my mind; when my oldest son was 3 or 4 another
kid at the playground grabbed his head and beat it into a bench several
times before running off. His dad approached me and laughingly slapped me
on the back about how kids are and that now they'd surely be friends. I
gently explained that for me and my family that wasn't ok and I'd rather he
kept his son from doing it again; he looked slightly taken aback, then
shrugged it off and said ok. That was it. That was life in Jackson Heights,
and while it was frustrating and shocking and tiring and sometimes
frightening it was ongoing and it was real. I *do* miss that. There's a
sense of reality falling away out here in the Icelandic countryside;
everything is so... safe.

It's a novel complaint to make in the middle of a pandemic, I know. But it
does connect directly (in my own mind at least) to your point about
training our kids in tolerance for difference without access all the time
to a full range of diversity. As you noted, disavowal of power is the
biggest issue here - in all its subtle and unsubtle forms of violence/power
- and how to help them understand and be vigilant about it in an
environment where they're not forced to negotiate it every day.

There's my $0.02, anyway. Happy to keep the discussion going! And yes,
heard from Jamie - hoping to talk to him later this week!

All best,
Josh
