Many thanks for this! I've asked my contact at PwC if he's familiar with it
and/or what he recommends; do I recall correctly that you thought this
meant I could use my US LLC to contract businesses and receive payments,
and then issue a salary to myself in Iceland where I would pay personal
taxes under my kennital?

I hope your return to Germany was uneventful - we're gearing up for a
strange school year here split between Iceland (in person) and NY
(virtually)!

All best wishes,
Josh

<br>
The new legislation is a social security totalization agreement:<br>

<br>
It doesn&#39;t affect LLCs directly, but what it does do is make it less <b=
r>
necessary for self-employed American citizens living in Iceland to start <b=
r>
an Icelandic company. The agreement allows them to do business under <br>
their own kennitala without that income becoming subject to American <br>
self-employment tax. Previously, they had to start an Icelandic company <br=

in order to escape double social security taxation. Now, it should be <br>
possible to get a &quot;certificate of coverage&quot; from the Icelandic <b=

authorities (probably Tryggingastofnun) confirming that the <br>
self-employed American is paying into the Icelandic social security <br>
system. This statement must be submitted with the American tax return.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m attaching the form that I get from Germany each year. I don&#39;t k=
now <br>
whether Tryggingastofnun has developed a standard form for the <br>
