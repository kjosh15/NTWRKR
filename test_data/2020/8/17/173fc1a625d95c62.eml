Thanks, Stephanie - sorry to hear about the storms!! Hopefully things are
settling back in to a better normal. (There's just no way to say "normal"
in a pandemic...)

We don't know if this'll be a permanent move yet or not. We're waiting
until after the elections to see how it looks. I'm working with some local
tax folks to figure out where my liability has to be and if I need to keep
running everything through my US LLC. If I can I'd prefer to, but it will
likely mean losing my residency in NYC (in terms of being taxed there).

If it's the the case that I don't have residency in NYC, but can run my
business income through my US LLC, then I'm guessing I could lower my tax
profile by moving the LLC to a better jurisdiction like Delaware or
Arizona, correct? Let me know if you have any experience / insight into
what might work here!

Many thanks,
Josh
