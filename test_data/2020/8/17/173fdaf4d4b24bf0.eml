Hi Josh,

This Personal Advisory Board letter looks great. I'm happy to discuss it
soon, depending on my WiFi connection. (More on this below)

Apologies for the radio silence on my end until now. As you know, my wife
and I went for a few weeks to French Polynesia to get off the grid. Like
your family going off to Iceland, we were heading to a beautiful location
with very few cases of COVID.

Well, we were a bit too successful! After being here a few weeks, we
decided that there was no reason to return to southern California -
especially when that area is going through a terrible heat wave (Death
Valley just hit 130 degrees, the hottest recorded temperature on Earth in a
century!), wildfires, power outages, and a still-raging COVID epidemic.
Since we can do all our work online, we looked for an Airbnb in a remote
area where we could have an extended work retreat.

Here's the catch: We asked the owners of the Airbnb place if they had
excellent WiFi, since so much of our work involves video calls. They
assured us that, yes, their WiFi coverage was first-rate. Sadly that has
been far from true. It's been erratic, and we haven't been able to do any
video calls. (Even regular phone calls drop all the time.)

Long story short: We are moving to a different island tomorrow and looking
for a new place where hopefully the coverage will be better. We're also
going to purchase a pocket Wifi tomorrow when we pass through the main
island of Tahiti.

So I'd love to catch up and discuss in the next few weeks. I just need to
find out if our two actions to solve the problem are actually successful.
If not, we are planning to come back to the US on August 30th. (If it
works, however, we'll probably stay out here until the limits of our visa -
October 15th. And if that happens, I can schedule a call to catch up at any
time in the next few weeks!)

More soon,
Scott
