Gustavo,

Apologies for the slow reply; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were
waiting on the other for feedback... (!!)

Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring options! I think
there's a few constraints we need to note up front, and may have to take
things in stages, but that we ought to start with what could work best for
all of us as we figure it out. I'm going to put out everything we know here
first (so we both know exactly what we're talking about) and then offer
some options.

We're managing three big things:

1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a friend interested
in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know more about this
later today/tomorrow. If that doesn't pan out then we'd love to have you
take them; as we understand it there's no quarantine requirements in either
Washington state nor NYC (see https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309 under
"What are the quarantine guidelines following travel?" > "Domestic
Travel.") That said, it's likely you'd have to find a place for you and
your son to stay at least a night in Seattle before heading back. If you're
going anyway you might as well visit the city and hike the cascades / see
the rainforests a little!!

If you're still interested in this, we'd have to figure out what's needed
for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which we think should
work for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I think we'd have
to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but have a friend that
we can ask to take them.

2) Shipping stuff. Near term, we're having boxes and vacuum packing bags
shipped to the house, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to
have shipped. We'd need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes
weighed, then we can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on
the boxes before pickup.

Longer term, we'd need to have our personal items packed up for storage
(books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn't a huge amount of this, and
the good news is that if we can work things out for a longer term
arrangement it would basically be giving you back a lot of space while
leaving everything you need to run the home.

3) The lease. We're still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they're
required by law to give us one at this point, but they're dragging their
heels (probably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I'm
going to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so
$1,125/month). Other monthly home expenses are:

ConEd (electricity): $100
National Grid (gas): $20
Allstate (renter's insurance): $16
Time Warner Cable (internet): $65
-----
Total: $201/month


Here are some potential options:

A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the cats, ideal - we're working on
this now as I'd rather spare you the errand + the claritin! If that doesn't
work, if you can fly them to Seattle we're happy to pay the flight ticket
for yourself and your son (or whoever else you go with!) Obviously we don't
have a ton of cash either so would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else
is most price effective. We'd pay for whatever shots or carriers or
whatever the cats need, of course, and probably have a friend that can take
them to the vet in advance.

B) Once we get the cats out, we'd be more than happy to have you stay at
our place for September if you can help us get everything packed up. No
need to pay for anything other than utilities for this month as we're
having the money come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we'd both be
doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!

C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we'd be happy if you could
pay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to
move somewhere else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but
that's a bridge several months away yet and we're happy to negotiate that
when we get closer to it!


Let us know what you think about the above, and sorry to send so much text.
I figured I'd put everything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or
assumed - right now certainty is in short supply! As you said in our call
today we're both looking for a win/win here, so feel free to suggest
anything, ask anything, or give feedback to adjust any of the above.

Looking forward,
Josh
