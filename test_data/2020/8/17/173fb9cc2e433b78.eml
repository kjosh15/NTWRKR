Good news and glad you're getting support while you need it. Again, call
anytime if you want to talk!

Separately, it looks like only Alaska Airlines will let someone fly with an
empty seat + two carriers. They're not clear on what
veterinarian requirements are relevant, however:

"A health certificate is not required for pets traveling in the cabin with
their passenger; however, many states have specific importation health and
vaccination requirements. Contact the state veterinarian at your
destination prior to travel to determine necessary documentation (such as
health and cold-weather acclimation certificates) and vaccination
requirements. Alaska Airlines is not responsible for any costs incurred
should customers not have the required health documentation to enter the
state or country."

Do you have a vet near you who you could call to verify that we don't need
anything specific done for them before they fly? We have no idea who to
reach out to that would be knowledgeable/reliable!

It feels like this is coming together!!

xoxo,
Josh
