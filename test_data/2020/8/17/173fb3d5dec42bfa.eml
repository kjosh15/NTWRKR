rst (so we both know exactly what we're talking about) and then offer some o=
ptions.

d in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know more about this o=

e understand it there's no quarantine requirements in either Washington stat=
e nor NYC (see https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309 under "What are the qu=
arantine guidelines following travel?" > "Domestic Travel.") That said, it's=
 likely you'd have to find a place for you and your son to stay at least a n=
ight in Seattle before heading back. If you're going anyway you might as wel=
l visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!=20
>=20
> If you're still interested in this, we'd have to figure out what's needed f=
or you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which we think should wor=
k for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I think we'd have to ha=
ve them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but have a friend that we ca=
n ask to take them.
>=20
> 2) Shipping stuff. Near term, we're having boxes and vacuum packing bags s=
hipped to the house, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to h=
ave shipped. We'd need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes wei=
ghed, then we can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on the=
 boxes before pickup.=20
>=20
> Longer term, we'd need to have our personal items packed up for storage (b=
ooks, pictures, stuff like that). There isn't a huge amount of this, and the=
 good news is that if we can work things out for a longer term arrangement i=
t would basically be giving you back a lot of space while leaving everything=
 you need to run the home.
>=20
> 3) The lease. We're still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they're=
 required to give us one at this point, but they're dragging their heels (pr=
obably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I'm going to as=
k them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months ($1,125/month). Other monthl=
y home expenses are:
>=20
> ConEd (electricity): $100
> National Grid (gas): $20
> Allstate (renter's insurance): $16
> Time Warner Cable (internet): $65
> -----
> Total: $201/month
>=20
>=20
> Here are some potential options:
>=20
> A) If you can figure out how to get our cats to Seattle we're happy to pay=
 the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or whoever else you go with!) O=
bviously we don't have a ton of cash either so would ask that it be Jet Blue=
 or whatever else is most price effective. We'd pay for whatever shots or ca=
rriers or whatever the cats need, of course, and probably have a friend that=
 can take them to the vet in advance.
>=20
> B) If either our FOAF or yourself can get the cats to Seattle, we'd be mor=
e than happy to have you stay at our place for September if you can help us g=
et everything packed up. No need to pay for anything other than utilities fo=
r this month as we're having the money come out of our deposit anyway and fr=
ankly we'd both be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!
>=20
> C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we'd be happy if you could p=
ay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move s=
omewhere else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but that's a b=
ridge several months away yet and we're happy to negotiate that when we get c=
loser to it!

. I figured I'd put everything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or a=
ssumed. Right now certainty is in short supply! As you said in our call toda=
