Hello Josh.
Noted on the current push back happening at Lululemon with their
acquisition of Mirror.
Appreciate the update and agree circling back with them once that has
settled down is a best strategy. Keep me posted on your timing to re engage=
.
Rae254 is a great product, currently developing marketing strategy and
materials for market preview;
I will share docs for the next engagement with Lululemon.

Dual Citizen Consumer Group evolved from my being a dual citizen, growing
up between the UK and USA.
As a kid I was fascinated how strong design trends travelled from Europe to
the USA.
Europe always trending 6 months ahead, US branding and marketing exploded
the trends here.
Welcome to the Club!

Regards,


Bridget
