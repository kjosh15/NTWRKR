Bridget,

I got some pushback from Lululemon on my pending meeting with them; their
R&D dept. is apparently getting some pressure to back off in the wake of
the mirror acquisition. I'm going to loop back in a month or so to see
about re-engaging. My apologies for the delay; I'm a little
disappointed but will keep after them.

Separately, what is the Dual Citizen Consumer Group? I'm now a dual
Icelandic/US citizen and am curious!

All best,
Josh
