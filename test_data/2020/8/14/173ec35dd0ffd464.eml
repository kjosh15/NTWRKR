Thanks!! Meeting with LA team is this afternoon, meeting with my friend in
Spain was yesterday with the result that we=E2=80=99ll back-and-forth text =
until we
have a one-pager. I really liked his take on doing a more non-traditional
style of documentary, and we also struck on the idea of having a different
Icelandic band do the score for each episode - would this suit your
husband=E2=80=99s bands?

Enjoy the hike!
- J
