Thanks Ashley, this looks great. Only a few questions:

- Are you available before the end of August (the sooner the better, but we
understand these are challenging times!)
- We'd need one crate for each cat; does that change the total price?
- Am I right that if we can get the cats dropped off at the airport with
whoever is going to fly with them, and someone to meet them on the other
end to pick up, the cost drops by $500?

Thanks!
Josh
