Thank you so much, Meghan! (To bcc.)

Sarah, pleasure to meet you! I think the email Meghan forwarded pretty much
sums it up; are you and a friend interested in a trip to NYC returning with
two cats, and if so when would you be available? We're eager to get them to
my sister ASAP!

Stoked, thanks all so, so much!

All best,
Josh
