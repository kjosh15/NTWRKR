LOOONG time no speak, but I figured I'd reach out as I saw you on the ITP
list saying you were in Seattle. This is a weird request, but...

I need to get my two cats from NYC to my sister in Seattle. We have an
empty apartment in NYC, and can buy tickets for two folks who want to go to
NYC for a few days before bringing the cats back with them. WA is one of
the few states NOT on the quarantine list for NYC, so you could just show
up and as long as you wear a mask (the same way you would in SEA) you can
do as you like. Do you have anyone you'd trust/recommend who might be
interested? We're keen to get them to Seattle before the end of the month.

Any help appreciated, and I hope you and yours are doing well!!

All best,
Josh Klein
