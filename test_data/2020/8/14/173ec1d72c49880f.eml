Thanks again for the conversation(s) in =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur last week=
; it was
enormously helpful to get your view on living in Iceland, in the EU, and in
non-English speaking countries.

To that end, I=E2=80=99ve been working with PWC to figure out the tax situa=
tion and
they have no knowledge of the foreign LLC exception you described having
helped get passed into law last year. Do you have any references I can use?

The pandemic continues to create a whole new world, and situations like
ours (USA citizens abroad) are becoming more common. Let=E2=80=99s stay in =
touch
going forward; I=E2=80=99m very curious about your intentions to spend a ye=
ar in an
English speaking country, for example!

All best wishes and with many thanks,
Josh
