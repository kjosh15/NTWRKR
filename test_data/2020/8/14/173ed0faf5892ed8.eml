Realized your burner community might have some of the bigger stuff the cats
would need; litter boxes (we have two, but assume that's because it's such
a small place), scratching posts, litter (we use World's Best) etc. We can
of course order these to be delivered to you, but if you've got a car and
an itch to use it these could be helpful!

xoxo,
Josh
