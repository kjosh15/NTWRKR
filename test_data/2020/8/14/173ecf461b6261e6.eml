Just checking in to see how your visit up north went. We're feeling
increasingly confident that we'll be able to negotiate a better price on
our lease, but so far still waiting. Our current focus is on getting the
cats moved to my sister's as soon as possible.

Hit me with an update when you get a chance, and I hope you and yours are
doing well!

All best,
Josh
