Hi Josh,

Thanks for the phone call.

To clarify the tax on your personal income will depend on whether you are
considered to have unlimited or limited tax liability in Iceland (if
limited it is possible to apply for a special exemption from taxation in
Iceland under a Double Taxation Convention). This depends on your residency
and time spent here in Iceland.

Regarding VAT (value added tax) everyone selling goods or services in
Iceland must declare and pay VAT - 24% or 11% - which must be added to the
price of goods and services they are selling. As your sales exceed 2
million a year you would have to register for VAT.
Foreign taxable persons selling taxable goods and services in Iceland are
liable for VAT according to the same rules and regulations as Icelandic
companies and shall be registered for VAT if the conditions for
registration are met. If the foreign company selling taxable services in
Iceland does not have a permanent establishment in Iceland it must entrust
an agent domiciled here to serve as its representative, including sending
notification of its activities to the RSK, collecting VAT on
taxable services and remitting it to the Treasury. We can assist with that.
We will also look into whether the services you are providing might be
exempt from VAT as they have educational purposes and let you know.

I will ask my colleagues the following:

   - Whether they are aware of special taxation in the US regarding income
   taxed abroad exceeding USD 130.000
   - Taxation of the capital gains
   - Whether it would be better for you to have an Icelandic LLC


Will refer to you on Monday, have a good weekend.

Kind regards,
