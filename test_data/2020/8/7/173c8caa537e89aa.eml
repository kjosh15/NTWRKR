There's two use cases here:

1) Bechtel wants to access the AWS instance using a PING's SSO.
2) Bechtel wants to access the application using a PING's SSO.

The links I sent are for the former; if we want the latter that's
application level and we would need some dev work by Liquid, yes:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-appli=
cations.html

That said, it's hardly a heavy lift (it's just integrating the
application's permissioning to AWS's SSO) and it makes us much more
extensible going forward (because clients can integrate their permissioning
clients like Ping into AWS' SSO).

Does that make more sense?
