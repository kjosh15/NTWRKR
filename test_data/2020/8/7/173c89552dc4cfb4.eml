Chris,

Did some digging on this and think I've figured out what AWS is looking for
here. Short version is that I think it's a small amount of work up front
with big potential upside.

Firstly, AWS SSO is an umbrella for integrating with whatever SSO provider
your clients have - in this case Ping, which is a SAML platform:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-appli=
cations.html

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/simplifying-fine-grained-access-to-aws-res=
ources-with-ping-identity/

We should be able to configure AWS with PingFederate or with PingOne to
enable a SAML-based SSO.
We will need to know which Bechtel is using, what AWS session tags are
required, and then configure AWS SSO for the roles and permissions desired.
Amazon has a template for this:

https://support.pingidentity.com/s/marketplace-integration-details?recordId=
=3Da7i1W0000004HBwQAM

You can enable SSO following this:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/step1.html

Then Bechtel can configure Ping to connect to our AWS instance through SSO:

https://support.pingidentity.com/s/article/Configuring-an-SSO-connection-to=
-Amazon-Web-Services

and

https://support.pingidentity.com/s/article/Configure-Amazon-Web-Services-SS=
O-for-multiple-roles-and-accounts

I.e., we make a couple accounts with predefined roles and they access them
through Ping, which connects to our AWS SSO. More information here:

https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/
https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/faqs/

If this works well, we'll be able to offer SSO to any client by virtual of
the AWS Instance using whatever SSO service (like Ping) that they have on
their side. The work required by us will have already been done in
predefining the roles, and we can potentially offload the integration to
their IT team.

make sense?
