In the meantime, yes, you should probably hire Eddie to take care of the me=

I'm sorry that I can't do more at this moment!

 Sonali,

Thanks again for taking care of our place and our cats while we're away - i=
t meant a ton to us to connect the other day and see that you were enjoying=
 it!

We spoke then about needing some stuff shipped to us, and went back over ou=
r lists to figure out what we really needed (attached, and=C2=A0here). If y=
ou're willing, we'll have some vacuum pack bags and boxes delivered. Once e=
verything is boxed and weighed we can calculate the best way to mail it all=
 to ourselves - at that point it should just be a matter of taping on label=
s (we'd order those also) and being around when they get picked up.

We also wanted to order some small stuff from Amazon (electronics, etc. tha=
t are super expensive over here) that need to be de-boxed and then packed i=
n with the clothes (so they look pre-used to avoid extra taxes on arrival).=
=20

Finally, there's a box of memorabilia on the top of the cabinets in the liv=
ing room with really precious stuff (pictures of the boys, etc.) that we'd =
like to have=C2=A0 shipped via certified and signed mail.=20

If that all seems like too much we can ask Weena's step-son Eddie if we can=
 hire him to pick up and mail the memorabilia box and receive the electroni=
cs and return them to you stripped of packaging; that'd limit the tasks to =
only stuff that requires access to the apartment.

Let us know what you think you can do, and thanks again!!

Your friends,
Josh, Hulda, Haakon, and Othinn
