Had some good conversations last night and it seems like we can get a
one-sheet to Bjork's manager no problem; a good friend of mine here is a
good friend of his.

Similarly, I know a number of folks in different foundations who might be
able to steer us in the right direction for pilot funding. (Singularity,
Kauffman, Aspen, Soros, etc.)

Can you take a first shot at a one pager and we can kick it back and forth
until it's ready to pass to Bjork as a first step?

best,
Josh
