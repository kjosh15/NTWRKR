We=E2=80=99re doing a mix of remote from NYC and local in Iceland (assuming
everything stays open). What a weird time of life!! I=E2=80=99m coming to g=
rips
with the idea that my rudimentary Icelandic may have to Improve here
shortly...

Otherwise everything is ok; still no work but some signs of improvement on
the horizon. The weather here is constant clouds, rain, and cold - but the
entire rest of my family seems to find that pleasant so we=E2=80=99re good.
Personally I=E2=80=99m enjoying playing Destiny 2 way more than expected...

Hope the boys are doing well and Lee is adapting the idea of a fully
virtual school year - bet you=E2=80=99re glad you have that backyard garden=
!!

Best,
Josh
