Just tweaked the plan a little (set a $100 deductible, changed the amount
total to $50k, etc) and then filled out all my family's info:

https://www.sevencorners.com/Products/Purchase#/resumequote?q=3D247c650e-44=
09-4ed7-9ac2-cff3c4ff2a83

And then was told it couldn't purchase the plan. Any idea why? I'm trying
to get this settled and purchased today!

Many thanks,
Josh
