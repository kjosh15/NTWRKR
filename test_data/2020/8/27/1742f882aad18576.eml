This is the fundraising strategy I outlined for Josh waaaaaaay back on
March 5, just before the proverbial shit hit the fan. Would be curious to
hear what you think in terms of acting on this (after the start of school!)

best,
Josh

Josh,

I finally spoke with a CMO with experience in scholastic fundraising
(Jeannine Haas, CMO of Gulfstream). She managed a $1mm fundraising campaign
for her children's school in Boston and more recently a similar raise for
their new school in Savanna, GA. She had some strong views on the right
approach, which I'd distill as:

1) Produce a glossy 2-page brochure,
2) Write a cover letter parents can use to deliver the brochure to their
workplace Community Affairs teams,
3) Provide a link to a video and a funding ask to reply to inquiries from
same.

In more detail, that collateral looks like:

1) Glossy brochure

A 1-2 page glossy brochure that starts with heartfelt message and
articulates the school purpose and strategic plan. This should include a
profile of 1 or 2 kids and what a difference the school has made in their
lives (people connect with a personal story). Specifically, this content
should articulate the purpose of the school and how it is unique to other
schools in the area - what makes EB special.

2) Cover letter

This is a very sincere letter to parents and should include the mission of
school, an ask to help raise funds, and a request to pass on the letter and
the brochure to the community relations person at the parents' companies.

Note that educational fundraising works best locally, so it can help to
create a shortlist of companies in NYC which aligns with the purpose of EB.

Finally, note that you can equally well tap into alumni using this same
approach.

3) Video

This is a 1-2 minute piece (2m max, 1m is much better) in which Principle
Josh showcases EB's purpose and why it exists. This is pretty high level,
but points to what makes the school special so corporations can literally
see andhear how they may align with it. (For example, AARP may respond
strongly to it social mission, and Boeing may like its focus on diversity
and project led learning.)

There are several parents in marketing who could help with the first and
second, and we've already identified a parent to help with the video. If
you're amenable, I'll invite someone to contact you about an interview for
content to put together the brochure. Once that's in place they can draft a
letter to parents for you to edit targeting a specific event (for example,
the MakerFair). Then, with those materials in hand we can aim to produce
the video to buttress the other two and deliver visually on the narrative
already established.

Let me know what you think!

All best,
Josh Klein
