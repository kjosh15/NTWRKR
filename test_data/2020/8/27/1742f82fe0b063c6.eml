Good to hear from you! I'm in Iceland, so GMT + waiting for g.voice to get
my US cell # ported. In the meantime, if you have time for a short catchup
call in the next couple weeks first thing morning your time would love to
reconnect - usually Tues/Thurs. are best for me. Let me know what works!

Good to hear business is booming - very exciting!!

All best,
Josh
