Hey ya'll! Please find attached (or via the link below) the shipping labels
to be attached to the boxes. Then they can be dropped off tomorrow at
FedEx. No idea how critical the date on the label is, so hopefully that
timing works out!

Again, thank you both from the bottom of our hearts. And Matt, the total
came to $616.19. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
