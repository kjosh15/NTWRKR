Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support,

There were no reports of issues on the Grid Services on the morning of Aug. 26th, 2020, that would have prevented a connection to indigometrics.com on the server.  If you were not seeing the same behavior on the site when reported by the client, it is likely that there was a network router between the clients location and the host server that is encountering high connection times or time outs that could trigger the error message reported.  To check for issues along the network pathway to the server the client can run a traceroute to the server using the information in the following article.

Using the traceroute command

If you have any further questions regarding your (mt) Media Temple services, please feel free to contact us at any time.

Best regards,

James S.
