I've talked with all of you at one point or another about the US vs. EU
conundrum, especially as I got EU citizenship and then especially
especially since the pandemic. One of the big topics that influences this
decision is upward mobility - what are the chances that my children will be
able to do improve their lot in life vs. fall into harder times? I.e.,
upward mobility.

This article is one of the best I've seen yet in spelling out the
statistics and considerations encompassing the issue in the US today:
