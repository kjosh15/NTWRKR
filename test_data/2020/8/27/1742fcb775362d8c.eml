Hi Josh,
Well, I didn't do a great job of communicating this plan to our Josh.
Plus, he likes to have his hands on the surveys, but we'll see.  We had a
deadline yesterday to get those letters out so we've limped along on what
we have.  He made a new survey but I'm not shared on it so I don't know how
well it is populating yet.  Will find out.   I think a phone call or zoom
would be easier for me to straighten all this out and ask questions.  I
have a zoom now but could be available this afternoon.
Thanks for your patience and sorry this is a little messed up.  LMK when
you might be free.

Betsy
