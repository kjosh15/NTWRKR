Will have a think and come back in more detail =E2=80=93 but in relation =
to the dynamic org chart (or dynamic team composition), that is =
completely how the structure and algos are set-up. We have a number of =
tables that can take team and org structure as dynamic inputs and those =
feed through into the job and integrity algos via a dynamic degrees of =
separation type of approach.

Would be good to know what software they use to record how teams are =
organised at any one point in time =E2=80=93 whilst the architecture is =
ready I have long been curious to see how that would work in reality for =
a large organisation.

Chris,

Had a good call with David just now; he seems pleased with everything =
that's going on so far. (Full call notes below.) He's getting feedback =
on the statements from his team - he really wants to get to a deeper =
level of WHERE and HOW people need to change behavior - and will =
reconcile those next week. Then he'll run them by his boss the week =
after, and thinks we can launch with the larger group the week after.

That larger group, BTW, will be corporate functional groups =
(engineering, procurement, construction and their corporate teams), some =
of whom have been in the existing cohort. That'll take us to about 180 =
mark and will give them enough data to see how to scale and what =
refinements to make for the enterprise rollout.

His big goal for this next tranche is behavior change - there are a few =
things he knows they struggle with but don't come out well in the =
statements, such as psychological safety, constructive disagreement vs =
inadvertent shaming or positional power, etc. (I.e., is this real =
collaboration or fake collaboration?) They're also driving more D&I and =
could do more around this and the topic of trust. If we have any =
suggestions on how to tease these out that'd be helpful - I told him =
we'd have a look at statements other clients used to see if there were =
any parallels we could suggest. Can you pull those?

Otherwise the big feature he'd like to see is how to tie in outlook =
insights: who you work with this week/month/quarter so you get questions =
only about people you're actually working with. I told him I'd circle =
back with you to see how we could enable more dynamic allocation of =
questions over time, and he pointed out that even if we could suggest a =
new org chart quarterly that'd make a big difference. Is this something =
we can provide as a "quick win" if they're willing to create a new org =
chart weekly, or would that screw up our stats?

best,
Josh



###

wants more feedback on statements from his team
mechanically it's great
high engagement from team
people are seeing it and it's prompting them to think
there's something in the statements that are too "good guy" scenario
how to get to next layer of actionable detail
people want to get more action clarity
refining the statement will be good next step

###

180 people will be corporate functional group
some of them have been in existing cohort
more of David's peer group and their teams
that'll take us to about 280 mark
engineering procurement construction and their corporate teams
that'll allow us to get enough data to see how to scale=20
what refinements to make=20

###

goal: behavior change
a few things he knows they struggle with but don't come out well in =
statements
psychological safety, constructive disagreement vs inadvertant shaming =
or positional power
stuff like that is still hard to find / tease out
is this real collaboration or fake collaboration?
they think we're collaborating but we can't communicate that we're =
trying to guess what boss wants
driving more D&I
could do more around this
topic of trust
doing more to tease these out would help

###

another thing he's interested in is how to tie in outlook insights: who =
you work with
one thing they were interested in is tying insights data into who gets =
the survey
so you get tied together with people you interact with

> talked about needing bigger scale to choose what other improvements to =
make
they just launched updated 360 process
they do once a year
more complex evaluation
he'll send me anything interesting they come up with
even if there was a batch process over a month's time to sort questions =
(by org chart even quarterly or monthly)
* can we do this with org chart api?

###

he's weeks away from launching next tranche
reconcile statements next week
then he'll share with his boss the week after
then they're good
* share whatever feedback we have on statements
