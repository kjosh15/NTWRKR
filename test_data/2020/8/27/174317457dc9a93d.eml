Hi Josh,

Here=E2=80=99s a tale of my wages when as a teenager I worked a summer at th=
e University of California at Davis in the Food Technology Department.  Duri=
ng a visit from one of my parents=E2=80=99 friends I told him I was making $=
1.33 an hour.  He was shocked that I was making so much.

It looks like Joel and I being born in 1941 were in the right era to make mo=
re money than our parents.

Love,

Mom
