blunt is good.

When we look at RFID we need to break it into two parts UHF and NFC. UHF
operates at and around 915Mhz, NFC at and around 13.56Mhz

NFC read functionality I would group directly with QR in the sense that it
is a 1:1 relationship reader to data source. This would in fact require a
visible tap target and aside from encryption, transaction verification and
writable memory compete with QR codes in most interaction use cases.
The "why not use QR" comment rings true here.

UHF read functionality is a one to many ratio. the reader can see a
plurality of data sources in a larger area, say 12 foot radius and over
1000 items for arguments sake. The user can flip through options on screen
and click deeper on particulars without singulating an item for scanning.
Options can be filtered to limit volume of information. Additionally images
captured by the camera and shared can carry with it clickable data points
of other items in view of the UHF reader (recently filed IP). Functionality
can be combined with applications like Google lens to provide additional
unique data such as ownership, expiration, size, style, price etc... to the
user. All from a distance without any need to singulate an item and
orientate the data source for reading.

volume growth for UHF item level sensors are significant (10.2 billion in
2019 unit sales). These sensors are present in the population today for
inventory visibility and can be leveraged for additional functions user
access and click through. Although the price point is in the 5 cent range
per sensor, items that currently have item level sensors for supply
chain and other purposes would reflect no additional cost to leverage.
