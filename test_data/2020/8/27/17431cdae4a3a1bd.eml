miscommunicated and both were waiting on the other for feedback... (!!)<br>=
<br>Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring options! I think th=
ere&#39;s a few constraints we need to note up front, and may have to take =
things in stages, but that we ought to start with what could work best for =
all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;m going to put out everything we know =
here first (so we both know exactly what we&#39;re talking about) and then =
offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re managing three big things:<br><br>1) =
Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a friend interested in=
 coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know more about this lat=
er today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t pan out then we&#39;d love to have y=
ou take them; as we understand it there&#39;s no quarantine requirements in=
 either Washington state nor NYC (see <a href=3D"https://www.portseattle.or=
g/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309</a> =
under &quot;What are the quarantine guidelines following travel?&quot; &gt;=
 &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said, it&#39;s likely you&#39;d have to=
 find a place for you and your son to stay at least a night in Seattle befo=
re heading back. If you&#39;re going anyway you might as well visit the cit=
y and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!<br><br>If you&#39;=
re still interested in this, we&#39;d have to figure out what&#39;s needed =
for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which we think should w=
ork for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I think we&#39;d hav=
e to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but have a friend th=
at we can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Shipping stuff. Near term, we&#39;re =
having boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the house, and have a sprea=
dsheet listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#39;d need to have t=
hat stuff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then we can buy shipping =
and have the labels sent to you to put on the boxes before pickup.<br><br>L=
onger term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items packed up for storage =
(books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn&#39;t a huge amount of this, =
and the good news is that if we can work things out for a longer term arran=
gement it would basically be giving you back a lot of space while leaving e=
verything you need to run the home.<br><br>3) The lease. We&#39;re still as=
king for a copy of the lease renewal - they&#39;re required by law to give =
us one at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their heels (probably hoping=
 things work out legislatively in their favor). I&#39;m going to ask them t=
o give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month). Other monthly ho=
me expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electricity): $100<br>National Grid (gas): $=
20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance): $16<br>Time Warner Cable (internet=
): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br><br><br>Here are some potential opt=
ions:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the cats, ideal - we&#39=
;re working on this now as I&#39;d rather spare you the errand + the clarit=
in! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you can fly them to Seattle we&#39;re happ=
y to pay the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or whoever else you g=
o with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a ton of cash either so would ask that=
 it be Jet Blue or whatever else is most price effective. We&#39;d pay for =
whatever shots or carriers or whatever the cats need, of course, and probab=
ly have a friend that can take them to the vet in advance.<br><br>B) Once w=
e get the cats out, we&#39;d be more than happy to have you stay at our pla=
ce for September if you can help us get everything packed up. No need to pa=
y for anything other than utilities for this month as we&#39;re having the =
money come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we&#39;d both be doing eac=
h other a favor. That should be enough!!<br><br>C) If we can get our lease =
renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if you could pay $500 plus the utiliti=
es for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move somewhere else in the n=
ew year, and we may want to move back - but that&#39;s a bridge several mon=
ths away yet and we&#39;re happy to negotiate that when we get closer to it=
!<br><br><br>Let us know what you think about the above, and sorry to send =
so much text. I figured I&#39;d put everything in writing so we nothing get=
s overlooked or assumed - right now certainty is in short supply! As you sa=
id in our call today we&#39;re both looking for a win/win here, so feel fre=
e to suggest anything, ask anything, or give feedback to adjust any of the =
above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-ma=
