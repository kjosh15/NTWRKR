ies for the slow reply; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were waiting=
 on the other for feedback... (!!)<br><br>Really appreciate your open-minde=
dness in exploring options! I think there&#39;s a few constraints we need t=
o note up front, and may have to take things in stages, but that we ought t=
o start with what could work best for all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;=
m going to put out everything we know here first (so we both know exactly w=
hat we&#39;re talking about) and then offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re=
 managing three big things:<br><br>1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may h=
ave a friend of a friend interested in coming from Seattle and then returni=
ng; we should know more about this later today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;=
t pan out then we&#39;d love to have you take them; as we understand it the=
re&#39;s no quarantine requirements in either Washington state nor NYC (see=
 <a href=3D"https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https=
://www.portseattle.org/node/11309</a> under &quot;What are the quarantine g=
uidelines following travel?&quot; &gt; &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That s=
aid, it&#39;s likely you&#39;d have to find a place for you and your son to=
 stay at least a night in Seattle before heading back. If you&#39;re going =
anyway you might as well visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rai=
nforests a little!!<br><br>If you&#39;re still interested in this, we&#39;d=
 have to figure out what&#39;s needed for you to fly with them; we have two=
 soft carriers which we think should work for flying with them under your s=
eats on Jet Blue. I think we&#39;d have to have them taken to the vet a wee=
k before you fly, but have a friend that we can ask to take them.<br><br>2)=
 Shipping stuff. Near term, we&#39;re having boxes and vacuum packing bags =
shipped to the house, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to=
 have shipped. We&#39;d need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the bo=
xes weighed, then we can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to pu=
t on the boxes before pickup.<br><br>Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our=
 personal items packed up for storage (books, pictures, stuff like that). T=
here isn&#39;t a huge amount of this, and the good news is that if we can w=
ork things out for a longer term arrangement it would basically be giving y=
ou back a lot of space while leaving everything you need to run the home.<b=
r><br>3) The lease. We&#39;re still asking for a copy of the lease renewal =
- they&#39;re required by law to give us one at this point, but they&#39;re=
 dragging their heels (probably hoping things work out legislatively in the=
ir favor). I&#39;m going to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 mont=
hs (so $1,125/month). Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electr=
icity): $100<br>National Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insuranc=
e): $16<br>Time Warner Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<=
br><br><br>Here are some potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly i=
n and pick up the cats, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as I&#39;d ra=
ther spare you the errand + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you =
can fly them to Seattle we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket for yourse=
lf and your son (or whoever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have =
a ton of cash either so would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else is m=
ost price effective. We&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers or whateve=
r the cats need, of course, and probably have a friend that can take them t=
o the vet in advance.<br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;d be more =
than happy to have you stay at our place for September if you can help us g=
et everything packed up. No need to pay for anything other than utilities f=
or this month as we&#39;re having the money come out of our deposit anyway =
and frankly we&#39;d both be doing each other a favor. That should be enoug=
h!!<br><br>C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy =
if you could pay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you ma=
y want to move somewhere else in the new year, and we may want to move back=
 - but that&#39;s a bridge several months away yet and we&#39;re happy to n=
egotiate that when we get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know what you thi=
nk about the above, and sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#39;d put e=
verything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - right now c=
ertainty is in short supply! As you said in our call today we&#39;re both l=
ooking for a win/win here, so feel free to suggest anything, ask anything, =
or give feedback to adjust any of the above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Jos=
