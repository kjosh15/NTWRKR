Keep in mind my contact is very technical, so his bluntness is widely
accepted:

"I thought most phones already did that? Certainly my Pixels can read
RFIDs...

On use cases: the most obvious would be around IoT legibility - i.e. let me
find out stuff about a device by reading its RFID. Not sure I love this as
a plan, tho, for various reasons:

1. Requires extreme proximity

2. Presumably requires some kind of visible indication of where to read, in
which case, why not use a QR code?

Unless these things are a) very cheap, b) can send dynamic info, rather
than just an ID, c) have some range, in which case things are different..."

Any thoughts?
