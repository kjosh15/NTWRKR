Perfect, love this as a starting point! Some questions:

Why is Iceland in the front of the idea? What is the target group? Who is
Ka=C3=B0l=C3=ADn - is she an actress or a digital character? What is the fo=
rmat? What
is the target group? Who are the people he feels are the extreme
environmentalists? What is the filming style? What is the documentary
element of it?

All stuff to discuss in our call - let me know when you're around!

All best,
Josh
