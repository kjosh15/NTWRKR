Great, thank you so much! One last question in terms of stating the value
of the packages.

We'd like to insure these boxes for more than $100/each in case they get
damaged / lost, but I have the impression that this will impact the CIF and
ultimately the customs duties/taxes. Is that true, and either way what do
you recommend to best protect the investment of the contents while not
increasing the risk of being hit with huge fees?

Thanks so much - really appreciate all your help with this!
Josh

will depend a lot on price and time to ship; at this point I can best estim=

deally we&#39;d ship things by the end of August and receive them by end of=
 September at the latest. We haven&#39;t started packing yet, so could real=

sea or air, but don&#39;t know what to expect in terms of either.<br>&gt; &=
