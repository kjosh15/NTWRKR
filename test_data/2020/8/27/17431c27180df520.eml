ply; my wife and I miscommunicated and both were waiting on the other for f=
eedback... (!!)<br><br>Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring =
options! I think there&#39;s a few constraints we need to note up front, an=
d may have to take things in stages, but that we ought to start with what c=
ould work best for all of us as we figure it out. I&#39;m going to put out =
everything we know here first (so we both know exactly what we&#39;re talki=
ng about) and then offer some options. <br><br>We&#39;re managing three big=
 things:<br><br>1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a f=
riend interested in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know =
more about this later today/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t pan out then we&#=
39;d love to have you take them; as we understand it there&#39;s no quarant=
ine requirements in either Washington state nor NYC (see <a href=3D"https:/=
/www.portseattle.org/node/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://www.portseattle.=
org/node/11309</a> under &quot;What are the quarantine guidelines following=
 travel?&quot; &gt; &quot;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said, it&#39;s likel=
y you&#39;d have to find a place for you and your son to stay at least a ni=
ght in Seattle before heading back. If you&#39;re going anyway you might as=
 well visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!=
<br><br>If you&#39;re still interested in this, we&#39;d have to figure out=
 what&#39;s needed for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers whic=
h we think should work for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I=
 think we&#39;d have to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, b=
ut have a friend that we can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Shipping stuff. Ne=
ar term, we&#39;re having boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the hous=
e, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#=
39;d need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then w=
e can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on the boxes befo=
re pickup.<br><br>Longer term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items pac=
ked up for storage (books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn&#39;t a hu=
ge amount of this, and the good news is that if we can work things out for =
a longer term arrangement it would basically be giving you back a lot of sp=
ace while leaving everything you need to run the home.<br><br>3) The lease.=
 We&#39;re still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they&#39;re requi=
red by law to give us one at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their hee=
ls (probably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I&#39;m =
going to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month=
). Other monthly home expenses are:<br><br>ConEd (electricity): $100<br>Nat=
ional Grid (gas): $20<br>Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance): $16<br>Time War=
ner Cable (internet): $65<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br><br><br>Here are=
 some potential options:<br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the c=
ats, ideal - we&#39;re working on this now as I&#39;d rather spare you the =
errand + the claritin! If that doesn&#39;t work, if you can fly them to Sea=
ttle we&#39;re happy to pay the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or=
 whoever else you go with!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a ton of cash eithe=
r so would ask that it be Jet Blue or whatever else is most price effective=
. We&#39;d pay for whatever shots or carriers or whatever the cats need, of=
 course, and probably have a friend that can take them to the vet in advanc=
e.<br><br>B) Once we get the cats out, we&#39;d be more than happy to have =
you stay at our place for September if you can help us get everything packe=
d up. No need to pay for anything other than utilities for this month as we=
&#39;re having the money come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we&#39;=
d both be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!<br><br>C) If we=
 can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if you could pay $5=
00 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move some=
where else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but that&#39;s a=
 bridge several months away yet and we&#39;re happy to negotiate that when =
we get closer to it!<br><br><br>Let us know what you think about the above,=
 and sorry to send so much text. I figured I&#39;d put everything in writin=
g so we nothing gets overlooked or assumed - right now certainty is in shor=
t supply! As you said in our call today we&#39;re both looking for a win/wi=
n here, so feel free to suggest anything, ask anything, or give feedback to=
 adjust any of the above.<br><br>Looking forward,<br>Josh<br></div><div hsp=
