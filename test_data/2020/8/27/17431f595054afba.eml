few additional points (should have read this through before hitting send)
- from a phone it is likely you would only see hundreds of items say 250 or
so max at any given time likely in a retail environment to be < 100 - the
architecture will not start to choke until over 3k tags are hitting the
reader with a read time window of less than 5-6 seconds or so.
- read rates are 100's of tags per second, read rates per tag would depend
on signal strength which directly relates to distance from reader.
- 13.2 billion units sold in 2019 not 10.2 billion.  projections are over
30 billion units for 2023.
