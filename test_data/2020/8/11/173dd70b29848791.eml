On shared transport we would have about 5 pets in the transport vehicle and
we would also give you a 4-5 day window for delivering your pet from the
time we pick Them up. The flight would have to be two flight nannies
because you can only take one carrier per person. We can=E2=80=99t have two=
 cats in
the carrier because when the flight nanny boards the plane they have to
take a cat out to physically show the airline the car is ok. To prevent one
from escaping or anything of that nature we would have to have one animal
in the carrier at a time. If you need me to explain anything in greater
detail you can always call me at (321) 2893032
