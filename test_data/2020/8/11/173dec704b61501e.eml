Hi Hulda,

Othinn did a great job today. I can see the progress from last week and I
can also see where the most difficulty lies, which is a good thing because
then we can work on that area of weakness. Typically when trying to get a
student to roll an /r/, I would ask them to produce a /d/, then move their
tongue back further in their mouth and finally add vibration with a cotton
swab. Othinn's /d/ is clear as day. The trouble comes in when I ask him to
produce the /d/ by moving his tongue further back in his mouth. He was able
to do so with about 60% accuracy, but he often starts to produce the /g/
which tells me he's not elevating his tongue in addition to not vibrating
it.

Drill practice is the best remedy for this. He was able to hear the
difference between my /g/ and distorted /d/ productions with 100% accuracy
so he can hear the difference which is great. He's really got to practice
stretching his tongue and reaching it up and back. The exercises I did with
him at the start of the session will help with that. I strongly recommend
doing those exercises a few times each day. If it starts to hurt or feel
uncomfortable, he can always stop.

Here is a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBZacz5w5X8> that does a
great job of modeling the exercises we did. You don't have to watch the
whole thing, but if you need a reminder, just watch 3:02 - 3:27. That will
highlight the first stretching exercise I want Othinn to work on.

Please feel free to reach out should you have any questions. Here is the
link for next week's session:
