Thanks, Julie! So am I reading that right that you're quoting $2500 to pack
everything except the furniture into a 10x15" container and to bring it to
your local Queens storage, where prices would be $325-450 a month?

Our guess is that we'd need the above, and then some months later to have
that same container picked up and passed to a company like Transcontainer
Transport for shipping. What would that cost?

Thanks so much for all your help with this - you've moved us three times
already, so we totally trust your estimates and advice!!

- J

Thin sheets of marble should be crated in a padded wooden crate. That said,
it is sometimes not worth the cost of the piece to build a crate for the
movement of a marble item. We do try our best to move marble pieces in
cardboard and blankets, but we can not insure marble or stone pieces.
