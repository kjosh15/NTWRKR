Thanks again for an amazing time - the whole trip was magical, and we all
enjoyed your family enormously. Looking forward to next time already, and
feel free to suggest a visit to Harry as soon as we get set up in our own
place!!

In the meanwhile, I have another call set up with the LA director this week
(so feel free to prod me if you can think of anything to ask beyond her
response to the pricing sheet you sent), and I=E2=80=99d love to connect wi=
th Ian
if you could send me his email address. He may have insights into a new tax
proposition that could be very useful.

Keep me posted on the event at the end of the month,

- J
