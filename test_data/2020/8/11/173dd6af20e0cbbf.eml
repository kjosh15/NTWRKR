Thank you for the information! A few quick questions:

1. For shared transport:

   - How many animals are in the vehicle?
   - How big are the kennels?
   - How long is the trip from NYC > SEA, and
   - Do you pickup/dropoff at our addresses?

2. For flight transport:

   - Does this include the cost of the tickets?
   - Is this one pet nanny per pet, or one person taking two cats at once?

Thanks!
Josh
