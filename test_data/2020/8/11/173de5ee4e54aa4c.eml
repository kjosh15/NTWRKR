The size of kennel will depend on the space in the transport vehicle based
on the size of the animals on board. So at the smallest size we would use
is a medium size carrier which is good space for any cat. It can most
definitely be bigger if the space allows it which likely happens all the
time. I can=E2=80=99t promise that only because I wouldn=E2=80=99t actually=
 know the size
of the pets at that exact time. Just being completely transparent.
