Allen,

My condolences. I hope his passing was peaceful and you're doing ok as time
passes. I wrote a short piece about Don here:

https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/donald-monchil-obituary?pid=3D195338=
340

It seems kind of impossible that he's gone; he'd been as steady a fixture
for me growing up as the rain in Issaquah always was. He always spoke well
of you and often gave me advice by saying what he had tried to teach you,
so in a lot of ways I  felt I benefited from your experience.

I'm in Iceland at the moment, but if you want to get a view on the world
from here - or if I can do anything to help - feel free to ping me. Your
dad was a good friend.

All best wishes,
Josh

Josh this is Allen, Don=E2=80=99s son. Sorry to inform you my dad passed on
2/3/2020. I=E2=80=99ve been monitoring his iPhone but it did not have his g=
mail
acct synched to it. I just opened up his iPad & saw your email. You are
correct, I would have wondered what his take on this pandemic would have
been too !  He was usually very even keeled when it came to stuff like
this. I=E2=80=99m in the process of wrapping up his affairs & selling his h=
ouse &
shutting down accts., like this iPad. I kind of ignored it for awhile but
it=E2=80=99s time to do so. If you want to converse any further, contact me=
 via his
other email donmon@seanet.com
