So, all of this feedback is fair and reasoned. Also, that yellow/green
Crowbox appears to be very well-assembled so that user did a nice job. IF
there are squirrels in that area, he's doomed, though.

Here are some specific thoughts in no particular order, arranged by issue:

Outdoor power safety: Yes, the person who stated that stepping power down
to 5 volts and THEN running power across a lawn/terrain to the box is
correct, but I don't know offhand of a good cable (that is, a nice long
cable) that can carry 5VDC a long distance and also not involve loss of
precious voltage. Mainly because we never explored it so we don't have a
good idea of cost, and we don't have data on voltage loss (to wire
resistance) across that distance. In the current plans, we very strongly
suggest (demand, really) that users employ a GFCI outlet and/or an in-line
GFCI with their A/C extension cord to promote safety.

The demand for portable power seems huge. We should probably publish the
information that I supplied to you about my experiments/analysis on the
power banks. I tested five banks and only the VOLTAIC brand properly works
on low-current devices without shutting itself off. Voltaic power banks are
a specialty item so they are a little bit expensive. Less expensive than
most in-line GFCI switches for extension cords, though, so it might be a
good tradeoff for many people. I feel like is going to become a support
NIGHTMARE as people read our instructions and then decide that an $18.00
30,000mAh power bank from Amazon "should be fine" and then start hammering
the forum with complaints that the Crowbox turns itself off. But I don't
think this warrants withholding the information. Rather, we just need to be
as clear as possible about the auto-shut-off features that 95% of power
banks possess.

As far as the applicator tip goes, I recommend these many times in the
video and in the written instructions. They are important. It sucks that
you can't just buy one for 50 cents. They actually cost over $1.00 each and
you have to buy a bag of 5 or 20. But they are essential for proper,
precise application of the cement. I'm not surprised a builder who worked
without an applicator ran into issues. It's a bummer. I wish the tube of
cement just had a finer nozzle so that people wouldn't need this extra
part. Actually, this problem came up a lot in designing the kit.

M2, M3 machine screws. These CAN be bought piecemeal, and also in small
packets, at Home Depot (and probably a lot of other home stores that have a
good fastener variety). Buying these online is probably the worst way to
get them because machine screws are relatively expensive and online you
have to buy large quantities. I use them for everything, so I end up buying
a $25 box of assorted machine screws every few months. We should point out
to the public that, while buying parts online is a good idea in general,
buying the fasteners at a hardware store might be better or at least
cheaper for a small project like this.

Gluing a bolt inside the box and closing with a wingnut IS a better
solution than the one I published (gluing a nut inside the box). In my own
defense, I realized on the DAY we were releasing that I hadn't provided a
general solution for the problem of closing the access door so I had to
just improvise something. I always taped mine because I was always working
with prototypes that I had to get into and out of many times a day. This is
a wart.

Sadly, there is some waterproofing trouble, but it's known and very
specific. I doubt that it comes from the coin magazine as mentioned- The
instructions indicate that the coin magazine should be hot-glued in
position, both to weatherproof it and to secure/immobilize the coin
magazine as the sliding lid is attempting to dispense a coin. It's the
'ears' (the two vertical tabs that keep the perch plate aligned) that can
leak, where they come through slots in the lid, depending on the amount of
rain and variations in thickness of source acrylic which can cause some
users to have larger gaps than others. I wanted to recommend sealing these
with hot glue, but it's necessary to remove the lid of the machine to
reload the coin magazine (since the coin magazine is hot-glued into the
lid) so we have a design problem/flaw here; Using hot glue to seal this
leak will prevent removal of the lid for coin reloading. I should really
start thinking about a stopgap solution for this. In my prototype these
parts fit tightly, and Seattle weather, while wet, never delivered heavy
enough rains to cause leakage in my prototype.


Hope all is well.

-Steve

gned) that can leak, where they come through slots in the lid, depending on=
 the amount of rain and variations in thickness of source acrylic which can=
 cause some users to have larger gaps than others. I wanted to recommend se=
aling these with hot glue, but it&#39;s necessary to remove the lid of the =
machine to reload the coin magazine (since the coin magazine is hot-glued i=
nto the lid) so we have a design problem/flaw here; Using hot glue to seal =
this leak will prevent removal of the lid for coin reloading. I should real=
ly start thinking about a stopgap solution for this. In my prototype these =
parts fit tightly, and Seattle weather, while wet, never delivered heavy en=
ough rains to cause leakage in my prototype.</div><div><br></div><div><br><=
