bummer. I wish the tube of cement just had a finer nozzle so that people wo=
uldn&#39;t need this extra part. Actually, this problem came up a lot in de=
signing the kit.</div><div><br></div><div>M2, M3 machine screws. These CAN =
be bought piecemeal, and also in small packets, at Home Depot (and probably=
 a lot of other home stores that have a good fastener variety). Buying thes=
e online is probably the worst way to get them because machine screws are r=
elatively expensive and online you have to buy large quantities. I use them=
 for everything, so I end up buying a $25 box of assorted machine screws ev=
ery few months. We should point out to the public that, while buying parts =
online is a good idea in general, buying the fasteners at a hardware store =
might be better or at least cheaper for a small project like this.</div><di=
v><br></div><div>Gluing a bolt inside the box and closing with a wingnut IS=
 a better solution than the one I published (gluing a nut inside the box). =
In my own defense, I realized on the DAY we were releasing that I hadn&#39;=
t provided a general solution for the problem of closing the access door so=
 I had to just improvise something. I always taped mine because I was alway=
s working with prototypes that I had to get into and out of many times a da=
y. This is a wart.</div><div><br></div><div>Sadly, there is some waterproof=
ing trouble,=C2=A0but it&#39;s known and very specific. I doubt that it com=
es from the coin magazine as mentioned- The instructions indicate that the =
coin magazine should be hot-glued in position, both to weatherproof it and =
to secure/immobilize the=C2=A0coin magazine as the sliding lid is attemptin=
g to dispense a coin. It&#39;s the &#39;ears&#39; (the two vertical tabs th=
at keep the perch plate aligned) that can leak, where they come through slo=
ts in the lid, depending on the amount of rain and variations in thickness =
of source acrylic which can cause some users to have larger gaps than other=
s. I wanted to recommend sealing these with hot glue, but it&#39;s necessar=
y to remove the lid of the machine to reload the coin magazine (since the c=
oin magazine is hot-glued into the lid) so we have a design problem/flaw he=
re; Using hot glue to seal this leak will prevent removal of the lid for co=
in reloading. I should really start thinking about a stopgap solution for t=
his. In my prototype these parts fit tightly, and Seattle weather, while we=
t, never delivered heavy enough rains to cause leakage in my prototype.</di=
