I agree across the board about not rocking the boat - but also think we
should have a chat with a lawyer about our liability accordingly. If they
feel we're covered then good... but if we're exposing ourselves to undue
risk as a result we may need to raise a flag.

Unfortunately I just don't know enough about how liable we really are. :/
