*TL;DR:*
*I've got a good potential contract opportunity in play and am finishing my
website in time to make a big marketing push by the end of August.*
Let me know if you have time to connect in the next couple weeks; I'd love
to get your take on my mid-term strategy and to see how I might help in
whatever you're up to!

All best wishes,
Josh


P.S. The most interesting thing I ran into this week was the idea that we
can use currently available AI libraries to allow us to talk to ourselves
in order to discover our own bias'. Not sure if this crossing of the
uncanny valley is horrifying or revelatory or both.

The full, detailed accounting (just to keep myself accountable):

These last two weeks I was traveling with family to a language camp as well
as setting up insurance here in Iceland and trying to get my cats shipping
across the US. Glamorous! I have yet to figure out taxes (if you have a
good US/EU tax advisor I'd love to talk to them!), but otherwise have three
updates on my larger strategy:

1. Takeda Pharmaceuticals. I proposed working 1/2 time with them to help
develop their HR technology strategy and roadmap; I'm waiting to hear if
this suits them and/or what rate they would pay. Right now all other
contract work has fallen through, although I do have a few farther-out
leads (including co-producing a movie here in Iceland...)

2. Network. I'm still updating my website, at which point I'll finish
polishing my whitepaper on this networking approach as well as my CGM
embedded sensor project pitch deck. Once these all are together I'll
multivariate test sending them to my network of ~3k people to see if it
generates interest in contracting me, in IndigoMetrics, or in one of these
projects. My goal is to have this ready to launch by the end of August,
when most of Europe returns from summer break.

3. IndigoMetrics. Our biggest contract is moving into stage II and I'm
hopeful I'll be able to convince Takeda to use it as part of the technology
strategy. Otherwise we're working with Big Spaceship (an ad firm in
Brooklyn) to update our marketing materials; they also think they have a
couple clients that may be interested in using it. Finally, we're currently
being pitched through 3rd party partners to two other large (>20k employee)
companies. Again, we're hopeful that we can get a couple more large scale
deployments soon so we can approach potential acquirers while appetite is
high.

This is the first "normal" update email: let me know what would make it
more useful. As ever, if I can help you please let me know!

All best,
Josh
