So we found someone in Seattle who would like to come to NYC for a couple
days and then return with our cats. However, she lives in south Seattle and
needs someone to feed her cats while she=E2=80=99s gone. Just once a day, a=
lthough
if you could hang with them a bit longer that=E2=80=99d be nice for them. I=
s this
something you=E2=80=99d think of?

FWIW, she=E2=80=99s a lawyer focused on defending protesters who have suffe=
red
police brutality. I talked to her for a while today and she seems really
cool. Let me know what you think and how you=E2=80=99re doing!!

Lots of love,
Josh
