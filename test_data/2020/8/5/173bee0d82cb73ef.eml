Hi Josh, see below brief explanation.

The first option is to keep your current setup and take the income through
your NY LLC.  It would mean:

   - You would need to claim 24% VAT if your service is provided and used
   in Iceland (if sales >ISK2m a year).
   - Pay NY income tax (federal, state, local).

The second option is to form an Icelandic LLC:

   - Formation cost ISK 131k
   - Annual operating cost ISK 17k + Assistance (if needed)
   - Your income would be taxed in two ways.  First as tired income tax on
   salary (35.04 - 46.24%) and then as a 22% income tax of the net remainin=
g.
   - Capital gain tax on dividends from the LLC is 22% (or 15%/5% using
   double taxation treaty).
   - Claim 24% VAT if sales >ISK2m a year.

The third option is to run this through your Icelandic kennitala:

   - Net income taxed in tiers (35.04 - 46.24%).
   - Claim 24% VAT if sales >ISK2m a year.
   - (Pers=C3=B3nuafsl=C3=A1ttur if you move your residency to Iceland is I=
SK 54.628,
   which means first ISK 155.901 is tax free)

You can run your business income through your NY LLC and personal income in
Iceland.

So the option you choose depends on the income tax you are currently paying
in NY.  I do think that if you are going to stay here in Iceland for some
time, it might be good for you to move your residency (so that you get into
the system), which means you will at least need to run your personal income
through your Icelandic kennitala.

If you form an Icelandic LLC, then I think it could be good to have your
capital gains tax there.  If not, then we should explore other options.
Keep in mind that if you move your residency, all capital gains in tax
havens are passed through and taxed using Icelandic rates.
