Matt,

Had some encouraging conversations and think there's a real possibility
here. A big part of it is that there's a huge community of folks with
film/tv capabilities who have a deep culture of getting things done, but
also because there's a lot of political will around the climate issue. For
example:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Roundtable_on_Climate_Change
https://www.andrimagnason.com/

Also Bjork is a huge proponent of the highlands here, the Prime Minister is
from the Green Party, the current minister of environment is a very
interesting guy in terms of investment and new angles to the topic, etc. We
can get access to all of these as the community is quite small and I've
been lucky enough to get to know some very connected folks in this
community.

The big questions now are around what a one pager would look like, as well
as how/where we could source financing - the community here is super small
and I don't think we'd be able to raise enough to do a good job of it. I
could connect with my contacts at NatGeo, Discovery, TED, etc., but let me
know what you think!

Stoked,
Josh
