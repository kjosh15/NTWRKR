Hi Josh,

Thanks for your great response to the bee incident.  Joel and I got a great l=
augh out of it.  Thank you especially for your concern for my accident.  You=
 are one considerate guy!  All is well in my mouth now.

Happy to be connected to Iceland even if it is about the virus.  Fortunately=
 it=E2=80=99s so much better than in the states.

Love you,

Mom
