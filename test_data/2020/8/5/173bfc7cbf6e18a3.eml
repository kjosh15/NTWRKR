Thanks so much for this! A few questions:

1) What does "service is provided and used in Iceland" mean? I do all my
consulting online, and am lining up contracts with a company that is based
in Switzerland, the USA, and Japan (so could pay me from any of those
locales).

2) I'm not sure how VAT works - is this functionally personal income tax?

3) We've filed for residency in Akureyri already. Does that impact these
options?

4) Currently we're paying ~30% in taxes (including federal, state and city)
in NYC as a passthrough LLC. Does that impact the above?

5) There are a number of options for capital gains; using an e-estonian
LLC, for example, has 0% capital gains (they just tax payouts) - the
question then being if I can protect against taxation in the US on those
gains.

My layman's understanding is that the best model from a tax perspective is
to keep the US LLC, pay business taxes on it, and then pay personal taxes
on a limited salary to our Icelandic bank account while utilizing as many
business deductions on the US side as possible for expenses here in
Iceland. Does that fit according to the above, and/or what am I missing?

Takk!
- J
