More interesting news; it looks like airlines are no longer taking cats in
cargo holds. This means that having an individual fly them to SEA is the
only option, which of course is slightly complicated in the pandemic. We're
researching more options now and have a line on someone who may want to do
the NYC -> SEA leg. We'll keep you posted!

Thank you so much for clarifying about the grocery delivery options you&#39=

So far I haven&#39;t heard from anyone who is making the trip from New York=
 to Washington. If the numbers don&#39;t change enough for Washington to dr=
op off of this list, I am still willing to go get them if needed. The quara=
ntine doesn&#39;t apply if you&#39;re only there
 24 hours, so I could literally just pick them up. I&#39;m of course open t=
o other ideas, but these seem to be the options at this point.=C2=A0</div>

Okay, so I have forwarded this onto a couple of my community groups. Thus f=
ar I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s a potential that someone will investigat=
e and then get back to me on. It was also pointed out to me that New York c=
urrently has travel restrictions with I
 think 19 other states, which I hadn&#39;t known about. This requires trave=
lers from these states to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, right now WA=
 is on that list.</div>

Frankly, given that I haven&#39;t left WA since Thanksgiving, I&#39;m tempt=
