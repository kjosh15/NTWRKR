Thanks so much for doing this!!! It feels like there are very powerful
ideas here, structured in an elegant, functional way. I'm really stoked to
see where you take it!

In terms of feedback, as I read it I kept coming back to the idea that I
wished you had a 12-slide deck that summarized it - there's so much depth
here that could benefit from a higher-level narrative. Also and TBH, the
language feels very familiar to early stage startups and nonprofits and
seeing it from a more narrowly focused abstraction could help bring out the
unique value this idea represents.

That's my first, and biggest, piece of feedback. My second would be that
the a) technology, and b) unique model of investment both suffer from
sounding like afterthoughts, instead of key differentiators. I would expect
that these will be the primary way you set Kiso Climate apart, so rather
than using the Why/What/How approach it may make more sense to follow a
more classic problem/solution/impact formula in which those differentiators
can be more cleanly spelled out.

Those are my main impressions on what to improve. In terms of being a
grant-based financing platform vs. an investment platform, why not both?
Allow grants to establish baseline funding protocols, with investment
opportunities on a case-by-case basis above / beyond initial dispensed
funds. This allows locations to self-promote and stack funding over
baseline investment - think stretch goals on Kickstarter. Just an idea -
TBH I think it's more likely a question of where/how you can get the
biggest impact the fastest, which you'd understand much better than I.

Let me know if you'd like to connect reg. in the next couple weeks or if I
can help any other way!

All best,
Josh
