Gustavo,

Really appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring options! I think
there's a few constraints we need to acknowledge up front, and may have to
take things in stages, but that we ought to start with what could work best
for all of us as we figure it out. I'm going to put out everything we know
here first (so we both know exactly what we're talking about) and then
offer some options.

There's three things we're managing here:

1) Getting the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a friend interested
in coming from Seattle and then returning; we should know more about this
on Monday. If that doesn't pan out then we'd love to have you take them; as
we understand it there's no quarantine requirements in either Washington
state nor NYC (see https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309 under "What are
the quarantine guidelines following travel?" > "Domestic Travel.") That
said, it's likely you'd have to find a place for you and your son to stay
at least a night in Seattle before heading back. If you're going anyway you
might as well visit the city and hike the cascades / see the rainforests a
little!!

If you're still interested in this, we'd have to figure out what's needed
for you to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which we think should
work for flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I think we'd have
to have them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but have a friend that
we can ask to take them.

2) Shipping stuff. Near term, we're having boxes and vacuum packing bags
shipped to the house, and have a spreadsheet listing the items we wanted to
have shipped. We'd need to have that stuff put in the boxes and the boxes
weighed, then we can buy shipping and have the labels sent to you to put on
the boxes before pickup.

Longer term, we'd need to have our personal items packed up for storage
(books, pictures, stuff like that). There isn't a huge amount of this, and
the good news is that if we can work things out for a longer term
arrangement it would basically be giving you back a lot of space while
leaving everything you need to run the home.

3) The lease. We're still asking for a copy of the lease renewal - they're
required to give us one at this point, but they're dragging their heels
(probably hoping things work out legislatively in their favor). I'm going
to ask them to give us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months ($1,125/month). Other
monthly home expenses are:

ConEd (electricity): $100
National Grid (gas): $20
Allstate (renter's insurance): $16
Time Warner Cable (internet): $65
-----
Total: $201/month


Here are some potential options:

A) If you can figure out how to get our cats to Seattle we're happy to pay
the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or whoever else you go with!)
Obviously we don't have a ton of cash either so would ask that it be Jet
Blue or whatever else is most price effective. We'd pay for whatever shots
or carriers or whatever the cats need, of course, and probably have a
friend that can take them to the vet in advance.

B) If either our FOAF or yourself can get the cats to Seattle, we'd be more
than happy to have you stay at our place for September if you can help us
get everything packed up. No need to pay for anything other than utilities
for this month as we're having the money come out of our deposit anyway and
frankly we'd both be doing each other a favor. That should be enough!!

C) If we can get our lease renewed for $1,125 we'd be happy if you could
pay $500 plus the utilities for Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to
move somewhere else in the new year, and we may want to move back - but
that's a bridge several months away yet and we're happy to negotiate that
when we get closer to it!


Let us know what you think about the above, and sorry to send so much text.
I figured I'd put everything in writing so we nothing gets overlooked or
assumed. Right now certainty is in short supply! As you said in our call
today we're both looking for a win/win here, so feel free to suggest
anything, ask anything, or give feedback to adjust any of the above.

Looking forward,
Josh
