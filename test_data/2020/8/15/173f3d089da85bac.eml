Hi Josh,
Off the top of my head ...

Remote Learning presents brand new challenges for curriculum, instruction
and assessment that have enormous implications for equity.

ESSENTIAL REMOTE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS
Google Classroom is free, and the DOE offers certain curricula, but these
don't meet all of our needs.  To offer the best remote instruction, we need
new platforms and curricula, most of which require paid subscriptions.
(coming out of pocket)

Dreambox (math platform)  =  ~$8,000 per year (we've already paid for this)
Epic! fiction reading platform = $1,500 per year
KIds Discover non-fiction reading/research platform = $999/year
Seesaw for early grades = ~$1,125 per year
TC Reading/Writing Project Writing Units -
previously teachers had shared these.  Each teacher needs their own set of
(paper) units for use at home.  2 more sets of each box = 2,366
We are also considering Nearpod as a schoolwide platform that could cost
$1-2,000 per year.

WIFI ACCESS
We have a handful of families with persistent challenges in WiFi access.
The PTA is funding 6 or 7 jet packs as a temporary measure.  Subsidized,
reliable wifi would assure that all students have equal access to remote
learning.

ADULT EDUCATION IN RACE & EQUITY
Pre-pandemic, we were on the way with this.  We had contracted with an
organization that facilitated three meetings for parents and guardians on
issues of race and equity.  We'd like to continue this work.  Estimated
cost = $3,000/year (really not sure--would need to ask Josh what we paid)

BASIC SCHOOL SUPPLIES
Ella Baker is committed to providing at-home school and art supplies for
every student.  This is currently being drawn from our budget, which limits
our expenditures in other areas.  The estimated cost of at-home supply
kits, designed to last for the first half of the school year, is around
$7,000.

SPEAKERS OF COLOR FUND
Ella Baker has been working for years to diversify its teaching staff.
This is slow work due to DOE hiring freezes and other systemic obstacles.
Therefore, our diverse community is not reflected in the adults that
children interact with.  We have sought out people of color to speak about
race and equity, the civil rights movement (and Ella Baker) as well as
their work as authors.  Often the PTA will provide funds, but typically we
lack sufficient resources to provide fair honoraria and speakers' fees.  We
would like to establish a dedicated fund for Speakers of Color.  We
estimate a need of about $5,000 per year.

TEACHER DEVELOPMENT FUND
Ella Baker is proud to have teachers who are lifelong learners.  They
regularly ask for more professional development than we can afford, and
many have the capacity to develop their own curricula and conduct action
research to advance knowledge of instruction at our school and beyond.   In
adddtion, we are committed to putting extra resources toward blazing an
anti-racist trail in terms of our content and pedagogy.  Last fall our 7/8
Humanities teacher presented at the New York State Reading Association
annual conference. Our PTA provided her some support for travel and
lodging, but Nina covered some expenses with her own money.
A Teacher Development Fund is urgently needed at this time for several
reasons:

   - the field of anti-racist teaching is developing quickly and its
   implementation is long overdue.  Our teachers need access to the last and
   best professional development in this field.
   - remote learning requires a whole new set of skills and raises the
   stakes for traditional strategies like small group instruction and
   individual conferring.  Teachers have to get better quickly and they need
   support.
   - teachers are under duress. Giving teachers more opportunity and full
   financing to seek out their own learning will not only improve instruction
   at Ella Baker, but sustain morale and build collaboration.
   - professional texts can be costly for teachers and the school.  For
   example, the text we'd like to use this year,  Cultivating Genius: An
   Equity Framework for Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy, by
   Gholdy Muhammad, costs about $32.  A copy for each staff member would run
   $1,600.

LMK what you think.  I can frame it all within Gholdy Muhammad's work if
equity lens is understated.
