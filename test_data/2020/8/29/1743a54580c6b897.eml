Totally get it - let me know if I=E2=80=99m stepping on IP protected territ=
ory.
Wanted to provide enough background that you could say if there is possibly
a there there; the potential of decent IoT has always really intrigued me.

I=E2=80=99ll get some details on how cheap cheap is and you can tell me if =
there=E2=80=99s
a conversation worth having about it.
