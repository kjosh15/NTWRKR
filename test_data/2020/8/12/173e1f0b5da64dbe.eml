Cool - here was my list of things to follow up with Matt on:

1) Can we order some electronics (kindle, FitBit, laptop case, etc.) to
your address?

2) Can we hire Ori to receive them and strip them of their packaging before
they can be shipped to us (to avoid taxes on arrival)?

3) Can Eddie get a box of important stuff from Sonali and mail it certified
mail to us? Happy to pay for this, obvs.

4) Would he or Nick be interested in flying our cats to Seattle? (Would you
be ok with us asking that??)

Matt thought they=E2=80=99d be on receiving the electronics, and I think th=
ey=E2=80=99re ok
with Ori de-packaging them, but would be good to know about the rest. Maybe
we can prioritize our list and ask them to do what they can?
