1. Reg. the VPN you'll need to shop around; they change frequently and
coverage will vary significantly based on region.

2. Three things:

a) They should be using a software repository service like GitHub (which is
owned by M$, so may be better options out there)
b) You should copy said repo locally, and set up your own
c) Enroll in a service like Backblaze so both Liquid and your code is
stored in three places: the Git repo, your local machine, and the remote
backup server.

Let me know if that makes sense!
