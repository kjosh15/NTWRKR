Hello Josh, If you need a specific date you will want to call a month

OK, so that's $800 to hire you to get our stuff out of storage, put it into
a 10x15 container, and deliver it to Transcontainer Transport for shipping,
right? If so, I think we have all the info we need except for how far in
advance

we need to notify you!






Many thanks,


Josh

=A6everything but the furniture, that you would need a 10 x 15 storage unit=
. I think that you could ship a 20 foot container, or 26 feet of a 40 foot =
if you want to take furniture.<br><br> We often work with Transcontainer Tr=
ansport for overseas shipping. Prices would come from them and they would h=
ire us to do the loading of the container. We could also put it all in a tr=
uck and bring it to their warehouse.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br=
>&gt;&gt; We would like to price your pack and move to local storage in Que=
ens at $2000 that would be packing everything and bringing just the boxes, =
not the large furniture. Adding the furniture would be another $1000. If yo=
u need us to bring the whole load to Claudia<br><br> Carby at Transcontaine=
r Transport we could do that for $3000. These are sort of average prices as=
suming that you have a master bedroom that we don=E2=80=99t see and a kitch=
en and all of the things that people live with. You have lots of storage ro=
om and shelving.<br><br> It looks like you have a lot of stuff and some roo=
ms that we are not seeing. That said, these pictures are enough for me to g=
et a good idea.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; The price i=
ncludes all travel time, fuel charges and tolls. We do not charge for parki=
ng tickets. Your price includes a one time use mattress bag for your mattre=
ss, general disassembly and reassembly of furniture pieces if needed, the u=
se of our equipment<br><br> such as wardrobes or dollies and the wrapping o=
f larger items and furniture. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; We a=
re assuming that everything fits in and out of the locations. If any items =
do not fit we will have to leave them in an agreed upon safe location. We w=
ill wrap all of the furniture in blankets and bring reusable wardrobes for =
your hanging clothing.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; All =
furniture that we take apart on your move will be put together on the other=
 side. Please keep in mind that we cannot insure particle board furniture l=
ike Ikea.=C2=A0 The joints have not been glued and the backings are often s=
tapled masonite. It never quite<br><br> returns to its original condition w=
hen assembled and disassembled. We can also not insure nature stone or drif=
t wood type natural objects that may have a weakened vein or hidden structu=
ral defect that prevents them from handling the stress of the move. Thin<br=
><br> sheets of marble should be crated in a padded wooden crate. That said=
, it is sometimes not worth the cost of the piece to build a crate for the =
movement of a marble item. We do try our best to move marble pieces in card=
board and blankets, but we can not insure<br><br> marble or stone pieces. <=
br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; This was based on an hourly rate of=
 $250 an hour for 4 men and a truck for 8 hours to pack and bring you to lo=
cal storage. Another 3 men at $200 an hour for 5 hours to bring the furnitu=
re to storage, and again, 5 hours to bring it to Carteret, load it and<br><=
br> return, 15 minutes to get to the job and 15 minutes to get away is incl=
uded in those estimates. If you think that we have over estimated the time,=
 you are welcome to pay for the move hourly.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br=
><br><br>&gt;&gt; This estimate is based on your list and comments:<br><br>=

tion is not always necessary, but if you would like to purchase it, we are =
insurable up to $25,000. The cost would be $5.00 per thousand dollars of de=
preciated value coverage. We cannot insure particle board furniture (such a=
s IKEA brand pieces),<br><br> however we will do our best to protect and ca=
refully transport any items of this nature. Your building and the workers a=
