Was putting a drop in each eye before bed and realized I didn=E2=80=99t j i=
s if I=E2=80=99d
passed this one on - putting this in my eye and then rubbing it into the
lashes has made contacts bearable to me, and my eyes generally don=E2=80=99=
t sting
anymore. Cheap, simple, and highly effective. I recommend!

Xoxo,
Josh
