We've got several

1. Pay AT&T $10/month to hold the number. You won't get calls, or texts,
and we'll lose our "unlimited" data plan when/if we move back to them.

2. Pay $10/month for google voice with your simple.is account. This would
let you integrate your contacts and get message transcripts sent to your
hulda@simple.is account, but may also entail a fee for upgrading gsuite (we
have the legacy, free version.)

3. Make a new google mail account JUST for google voice. You'd have to log
into google hangouts separately, but we could port your US # to it for free
and it would ring through and send texts to the hangouts app on your phone
directly.

The last one is the most theoretical and the most kludgy, but it would
"park" your cell # for free until future need. Seems like our best
potential option.

Let me know what you think!

Love,
Josh
