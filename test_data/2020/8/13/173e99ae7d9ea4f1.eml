Hello Josh,

I'm so sorry for the delay.

Regarding the move to Iceland - You are currently paying tax to the IRS,
NYS and NYC through UBT (as long as the business income is under $100K, the
NYC UBT doesn't apply).  Is this a permanent move?  If it is not, I would
not recommend trying to short NYS their share of the taxes.  They are known
to audit people that have "moved" out and then moved back (it happened to a
client of mine that actually moved to California for 3 years and
returned).  I would operate as you usually would.

Regarding unemployment - I would apply what do you have to lose? The PPP
loan that you received was based on a calculation of 10 weeks (I believe
they took your schedule C income and divided by 12 and times 2.5) so it is
my understanding that after 10 weeks you should be able to file for
unemployment.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
