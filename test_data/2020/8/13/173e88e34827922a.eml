Just got off a zoom session with him in which he was talking about "Driving
Culture in Challenging Times." His big point was that in companies he
advises culture is actively managed. Most of what that meant seems to be a)
someone is responsible for it, and b) they do surveys.

He's on the board of Exxon, whom we almost got as a customer a while back.
I'd like to approach him once we have our new deck/site!
