Any edits/thoughts/suggestions?

xoxo,

########

Padma,

Based on our conversation I've pulled out three main areas of work, some
associated deliverables, and a rough project order for purposes of
discussion. I close with a couple notes on structure and some open
questions before we formulate this into a contract.


# Areas of Work:

- *Technology Strategy* (codifying your people strategy without
articulating it outright)
Getting to this by interviewing potential shareholders to create buy-in,
Then building this into a *roadmap* that selectively chooses *where to
leapfrog*

- *Data Literacy Education Campaign* for HR, focused on how/why data is a
strategic imperative
Use the Strategy interviews (above) to build a *competency map* and
identify *education leverage points*,
Then build a campaign/process to develop competency in how the IDEAS around
data shape choices, vs. "just headcount."

- *Advisory work* across the company in overall tech/data strategy
Technology advisory board,
Specific projects/initiatives,
Meeting w/ Christof (CEO), etc.


# Project order:

1. Interview all potential shareholders to validate existing asset map,
create buy-in to strategy, and surface competency around data literacy.

2. Formulate technology strategy to codify people strategy. This will guide
technology investments, rollouts, and identify key leapfrog opportunities.

3. Use technology strategy to build short-, mid-, and long-term technology
roadmap.

4. Use insights gathered above to create data literacy education campaign.

~. Advisory work as highlighted above can happen concurrent to the above.
My intuition is that this will increase over time as I build relationships
within the company and create confidence in the strategy.


# Structure:

I suggested we start with 1/2 time (2.5 days/week, 20hrs/week, 130
days/year, or however we choose to measure it) because I believe there is
significant immediate impact to be made around workforce agility, data, and
considered technological leapfrogging. If we structure this as a retainer
or per diem (plus expenses such as travel) we can throttle/accelerate as
needed. To that end I usually build in a review period quarterly to allow
for adjustment.


# Questions:

A) Are the above areas correct for where you think I could produce the
biggest impact, and do they align with your immediate needs?

B) Does the timeline above look correct?

C) I feel most confident in building the strategy and roadmap, and have the
most questions around the Data Literacy Campaign. Do you have more feedback
on how you'd like the latter shaped, or are you comfortable with my
discovering this through the interview/strategy process?


Finally, as we're taking our first steps into collaboration here let me
know if more/less detail works better for you for these kinds of
communications. Otherwise let me know if any of the above needs adjustment
and I'll revert ASAP before conferring with Ellie at Korn Ferry!

Looking forward,
Josh
