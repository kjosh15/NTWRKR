Padma,

Based on our conversation I've pulled out three main areas of work, some
associated deliverables, and a rough project order for purposes of
discussion. I close with a couple notes on structure and some open
questions before we formulate this into a contract.


*# Areas of Work:*

   - *Technology Strategy* (codifying your people strategy without
   articulating it outright)
      - Getting to this by interviewing potential shareholders to create
      buy-in,
      - Then building this into a *roadmap* that selectively chooses *leapf=
rog
      targets*


   - *Data Literacy Education Campaign* for HR, focused on how/why data is
   a strategic imperative
      - Use the strategy interviews (above) to build a competency map and
      identify leverage points,
      - Then build a campaign/process to develop competency in how the
      IDEAS around data shape choices, vs. "just headcount."

      - *Advisory Work* across the company in overall tech/data strategy
      - Technology advisory board,
      - Specific projects/initiatives,
      - Meeting w/ Christof (CEO), etc.


*# Project order:*

1. Interview all potential shareholders to validate existing asset map,
create buy-in to strategy, and surface competency around data literacy.
2. Formulate technology strategy to codify people strategy. This will guide
investments, rollouts, and identify key leapfrog opportunities.
3. Use said technology strategy to build a short-, mid-, and long-term
roadmap and measurement/pivot targets.
4. Use insights gathered above to create a data literacy education campaign=
.
~. Advisory work as highlighted above can happen concurrent to the above.
My intuition is that this will increase over time as I build relationships
within the company and create confidence in the strategy.



*# Structure:*

I suggested we start with 1/2 time because I believe there is significant
immediate impact to be made around workforce agility, data, and considered
technological leapfrogging. If we structure this as a retainer or per diem
(plus expenses such as travel) we can throttle/accelerate as needed. To
that end I usually build in a review period quarterly to allow for
adjustment.



*# Questions:*

A) Are the above areas correct for where you think I could produce the
biggest impact, and do they align with your immediate needs?
B) Does the project order above look correct?
C) Are there any other longer-term goals or deliverables that the above
work should consider?


Tell me where/if the above needs adjustment and I'll revert ASAP before
conferring with Ellie at Korn Ferry!

Looking forward to it,
Josh
