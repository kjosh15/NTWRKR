Couldn't find a way to turn off the firewall from MT. That said, there
seems to be a lot of optimization that could be done on the site before you
pay for a CDN. For example, you could reduce image sizes (WP-SmushIt),
minify your javascript and CSS (Minify), cache your content, (W3 Total
Cache), optimize the DB (WP-Optimize), LazyLoad to your images (there are a
lot on the site), and of course deactivate or uninstall plugins - you have
a lot running atm. Let me know if any of those help!
