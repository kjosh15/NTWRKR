Russ,

Gene recommended I get in touch with you; we recently moved to Iceland (at
least in the short term) from NYC, and are trying to figure out how to
manage taxes, etc. My understanding is that I can use my LLC in NYC for
business expenses, and pay personal taxes here in Iceland (I'm confirming
that with a local CPA now)  and write off business costs incurred here in
NYC to create a better total tax profile.

If this is true, it does prompt two big questions, however.

1) Can I move my LLC from NYC to a more tax-friendly jurisdiction (i.e.,
Delaware, AZ, etc.)?

2) My sons are still enrolled in the local NYC school, remotely. We're
keeping our address, phone number, etc. in NYC - will moving our personal
tax location or my business base disrupt this?

Any advice you can provide would be much appreciated - ultimately I'm
likely to need more help in this area as I also have a startup that's
looking like it will exit in the next couple years, so once I get these
initial tax questions resolved I'll have to find a better place to put
those stock. (The company is currently based in the UK, but I also have an
e-estonia account, etc.)

Much obliged,
Josh
