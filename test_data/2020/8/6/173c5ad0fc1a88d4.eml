We were invited to a family BBQ with one of Othinn=E2=80=99s friends from c=
amp and ate our fill of foal and Wolffish (arctic catfish) while the kids r=
an all over the beach and the hills. Really, really grateful to be able to =
spend time this way while the rest of the world struggles so fitfully. Defi=
nitely counting our blessings.

Lots of love,
Josh
