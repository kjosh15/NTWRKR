below brief explanation.<br clear=3D"all"><div><br></div><div>The first opt=
ion is to keep your current setup and take the income through your NY LLC.=
=C2=A0 It would mean:</div><div><ul><li>You would need to claim 24% VAT if =
your=C2=A0service is provided and used in Iceland (if sales &gt;ISK2m a yea=
r).</li><li>Pay NY income tax (federal, state, local).<br></li></ul><div>Th=
e second option is to form an Icelandic LLC:</div></div><div><ul><li>Format=
ion=C2=A0cost ISK 131k</li><li>Annual operating cost ISK 17k=C2=A0+ Assista=
nce (if needed)</li><li>Your income would be taxed in two ways.=C2=A0 First=
 as tired income tax on salary (35.04 - 46.24%) and then as a 22% income ta=
x of the net remaining.<br></li><li>Capital gain tax on dividends from the =
LLC is 22% (or 15%/5% using double taxation treaty).</li><li>Claim 24% VAT =
if sales &gt;ISK2m a year.</li></ul><div>The third option is to run this th=
rough your Icelandic kennitala:</div></div><div><ul><li>Net income taxed in=
 tiers (35.04 - 46.24%).</li><li>Claim 24% VAT if sales &gt;ISK2m a year.<b=
r></li><li>(Pers=C3=B3nuafsl=C3=A1ttur if you move your residency to Icelan=
d is ISK=C2=A054.628, which=C2=A0means first ISK 155.901 is tax free)</li><=
/ul></div><div>You can run your business income through your NY LLC and per=
sonal income in Iceland.</div><div><br></div><div>So the option you choose =
depends on the income tax you are currently paying in NY.=C2=A0 I do think =
that if you are going to stay here in Iceland for some time, it might be go=
od for you to move your residency (so that you get into the system), which =
means you will at least need to run your personal income through your Icela=
ndic kennitala.</div><div><br></div><div>If you form an Icelandic LLC, then=
 I think it could be good to have your capital gains tax there.=C2=A0 If no=
t, then we should explore other options.=C2=A0 Keep in mind that if you mov=
e your residency, all capital gains in tax havens are passed through and ta=
xed using Icelandic rates.</div><div><br></div><div>Cc on this e-mail=C2=A0=
