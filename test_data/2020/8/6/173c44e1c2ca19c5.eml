/div><div>The first option is to keep your current setup and take the incom=

d to claim 24% VAT if your=C2=A0service is provided and used in Iceland (if=
 sales &gt;ISK2m a year).</li><li>Pay NY income tax (federal, state, local)=
.<br></li></ul><div>The second option is to form an Icelandic LLC:</div></d=
iv><div><ul><li>Formation=C2=A0cost ISK 131k</li><li>Annual operating cost =
ISK 17k=C2=A0+ Assistance (if needed)</li><li>Your income would be taxed in=
 two ways.=C2=A0 First as tired income tax on salary (35.04 - 46.24%) and t=
hen as a 22% income tax of the net remaining.<br></li><li>Capital gain tax =
on dividends from the LLC is 22% (or 15%/5% using double taxation treaty).<=
/li><li>Claim 24% VAT if sales &gt;ISK2m a year.</li></ul><div>The third op=
tion is to run this through your Icelandic kennitala:</div></div><div><ul><=
li>Net income taxed in tiers (35.04 - 46.24%).</li><li>Claim 24% VAT if sal=
es &gt;ISK2m a year.<br></li><li>(Pers=C3=B3nuafsl=C3=A1ttur if you move yo=
ur residency to Iceland is ISK=C2=A054.628, which=C2=A0means first ISK 155.=
901 is tax free)</li></ul></div><div>You can run your business income throu=
gh your NY LLC and personal income in Iceland.</div><div><br></div><div>So =
the option you choose depends on the income tax you are currently paying in=
 NY.=C2=A0 I do think that if you are going to stay here in Iceland for som=
e time, it might be good for you to move your residency (so that you get in=
to the system), which means you will at least need to run your personal inc=
ome through your Icelandic kennitala.</div><div><br></div><div>If you form =
an Icelandic LLC, then I think it could be good to have your capital gains =
tax there.=C2=A0 If not, then we should explore other options.=C2=A0 Keep i=
n mind that if you move your residency, all capital gains in tax havens are=
 passed through and taxed using Icelandic rates.</div><div><br></div><div>C=
