Tried emailing Jamie Allen on your rec. but the email addresses I have for
him are all busted. Can you connect us? We haven't spoken since 2012 when
he was setting up CIID in Denmark but I'm keen to get his take on
Germany/EU.

Separately, I passed your IMDB link around a bit - let me know what else to
share!

best,
Josh
