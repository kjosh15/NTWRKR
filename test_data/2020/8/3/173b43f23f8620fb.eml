I'm just stacking them up! To whit:

1. Do you need my Form 5498 from Vanguard?
2. My LLC is currently based in NYC, but if I'm using it for most of my
financial management while abroad it may make sense to move it to a better
tax jurisdiction. Do you concur, and if so what do you recommend?

Hope you're well,
Josh
