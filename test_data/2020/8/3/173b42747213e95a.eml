Anna Hildur,

Here's the rough idea presented to me by mattdanzico.com - he's based in
Barcelona ATM but has very good connections with the BBC and other news and
documentary channels:

#######

# Saving Iceland #

Saving Iceland is a cinematic eight-part series that examines the advanced
technologies being developed around the world to save earth's coldest
locales from melting as well as the rest of the planet from the
ever-approaching climate catastrophe. Using Iceland=E2=80=99s glaciers and =
the
broader landscape of the country as a recoccuring visual example of how
climate change is impacting our world, Saving Iceland will venture to the
far pockets of the globe to unearth research being done to save all of
Earth=E2=80=99s coldest lands.

Next steps would be to craft a one-sheet. Then if there=E2=80=99s committed
interest, a treatment.

#######

Does this seem like the kind of thing we could get support for internally
here in Iceland? If so, we could then look to pitch it to the UK and US
documentary communities.

Thoughts?
Josh
