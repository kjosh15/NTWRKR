Most of my purview is through World 50, a private organization for senior
executives. I'm on retainer to them so take calls from executives from
across the board - CPG, petrochemical, pharma, etc. My impression has been
that many are starting to recognize opportunities for M&A and investment,
but that they're (in line with historic activity) slower to act than they
would like due to internal bureaucracy - hence the inertia. A number of
them are also finding incredible efficiencies in going virtual, which may
be highlighting the disparity between appetite and action in investment.

Working for Iceland is a dream, at least in terms of connectivity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland>. Most homes have fibre,
and because of their heavy investment in the space I'm getting 60-90Mbps on
my cell phone most places. If you feel like hiking up a waterfall and then
stopping at a picnic spot to take some zoom calls that's totally an option.
Only downside is that it's cold - between 40-60F most of the time - and in
the winter will be dark most of the time. That said, given that I'm mostly
heads-down building a company (and doing remote consulting the rest of the
time) it's a pretty great place to be atm. I hope you can make it over!

All best,
Josh
