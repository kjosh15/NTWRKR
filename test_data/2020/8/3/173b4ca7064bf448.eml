Here's a draft!

Sonali,

Thanks again for taking care of our place and our cats while we're
away - it meant a ton to us to connect the other day and see that you
were enjoying it!

We spoke then about needing some stuff shipped to us, and went back
over our lists to figure out what we really needed. It's basically all
clothes and some kids books (see attached list). If you're willing,
we'll have some vacuum pack bags and boxes delivered. Once everything
is boxed and weighed we can calculate the best way to mail it all to
ourselves - at that point it should just be a matter of taping on
labels (we'd order those also) and being around when they get picked
up.

Other than that there are three potential requests:

1. I have a pair of black Warby Parker glasses in a grey glasses case
on the shelf in the hallway. I wanted to get the lenses replaced,
which means packing and shipping them to lensabl.com and then
receiving them when they return.

2. There's a box of memorabelia on the top of the cabinets in the
living room with really precious stuff (pictures of the boys, etc.)
that we'd like to have shipped via certified and signed mail. That
requires going to the post office, which is its own version of hell,
we know.

3. There are a few things we wanted to order from Amazon (mostly
electronics) which need to have their labels taken off and then be
packed among the clothing so they look used. This way we can
(hopefully) avoid the VAT taxes when they arrive in Iceland. Along
those same lines, are there any computers in the bottom lefthand
drawer in the living room? If so, we'd like to have them included
along with the mini and the hard drives plugged into it.

If that all seems like too much we can ask Weena's son-in-law Eddie if
he'd pick up the glasses and the memorabilia box and receive the
electronics and return them to you stripped of packaging.

Let us know what you think you can do, and thanks again!!

Your friends,
Josh, Hulda, Haakon, and Othinn

P.S. there's also a pile of Queens library books on a high shelf in
the dining room near the door. If you could deposit those so they get
back in circulation that'd be a huge plus also!
