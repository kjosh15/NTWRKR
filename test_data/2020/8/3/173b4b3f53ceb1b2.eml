You can find a huge .zip file here with all five episodes:

http://www.ghettosommelier.com/TEMP/TheLink.zip

Let me know when you've downloaded them so I can delete them from the
upload site

My only request in return would be if they could somehow find their way on
to YouTube or Vimeo. I'd very much like to point to them from my website,
but have been asked not to post them myself. Any help would be appreciated!

Enjoy, and thanks!!
Josh
