Haakon says oh my gosh!! Othinn says his cousin got stung in the eye one
time. Haakon thinks you should spit it out faster next time, and provided
many illustrations of how it could be done. Sorry to hear you got stung,
Mom!!!

We=E2=80=99re in far remote =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur, a beautiful little t=

fjords. Covid cases are spiking in Iceland and we=E2=80=99re watching the n=
umbers
closely - so far the gov=E2=80=99t is taking it very seriously.

Sending lots of love,
Josh
