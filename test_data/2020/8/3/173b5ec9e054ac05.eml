Yes, I'm asking about buying a policy. I'd like one that covers medical
expenses including Covid-19 (as below) from Aug 15-Dec 17th. I don't have
US coverage but can get Icelandic coverage for everything except Covid
while we're here.

Thanks!
Josh

Does your plan cover COVID-19 related expenses (tests, diagnostics, doctor
visits or hospital stays) and does insurance in the country you're visiting
(Iceland) count towards existing coverage? Thanks!
