Jamie,

Haven't talked to you since 2012, when you were setting up CIID. I was
recently talking to Toshi Ozawa who mentioned you'd since moved to
Berlin (or at least had a place there!) My family recently moved to
Iceland from NYC and are setting our sights on Berlin this spring, but
I'd love to get your take on the EU generally if you're available for
a short call to catch up. Let me know if you have time in the next
couple weeks!

All best,
Josh
