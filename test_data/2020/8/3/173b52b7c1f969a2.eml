Jordan,

Do you have time for a brief call in the next couple weeks? I've been
talking to an RFID company (Lululemon is already working with them but
I've been helping expand their remit), an ultraviolet light sanitation
solution for in-store covid-cleaning, and a parkour company with a big
library of content that might be suitable for Mirror.

Also, I'm *super* curious what you're working on given the impact on
retail since the pandemic - let me know if you have time to briefly
chat!

All best wishes,
Josh
