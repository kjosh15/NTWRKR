It was fine in the end. We needed special permission by the consulate =
but we received that just fine.

Looking forward to hearing what comes of your Iceland meetings in the =
far north.

I really think this idea has legs. Obviously, it=E2=80=99s just a blurb. =
But we can craft this into a one-sheet and then a treatment easily.

It requires quite a bit of design work, which is why I=E2=80=99d advise =
we simply float the idea out over a coffee to begin and then take it in =
steps from there.

Once a group is onboard, we should be pretty well-suited to hooking a =
network.

A program about what technological advances are being crafted to thwart =
climate change would actually be quite a brilliant series.

Looking forward to hearing how it goes.

Matt
