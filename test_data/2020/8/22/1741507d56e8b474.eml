Pleasure speaking with you earlier - again, let me reiterate my interest in=
 your COVID-19 dashboard. That&#39;s a genius idea and an extraordinarily n=
ecessary one now and going forward!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In terms of Avery Dennison, we felt that there are a few RFID plays for Est=
ee that could help get the most out of the new normal due to COVID:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) BOPIS (Buy Online Pick up In Store) - Likely to see big growth. Knowing =
how much inventory you have where and when is key. The value of a good inve=
ntory is magnified when you broadcast to a customer that can then come and =
pick it up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) UHF to confirm sterility - UHF is being explored as a way to confirm to =
customers/consumers that a garment has been treated, sterilized or not yet =
tried on; similar assurances might be helpful for cosmetics.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3) LiA (Local Inventory Ads) - we have been working with Google on the LiA =
initiative. This allows for local search online via google for in stock ite=
ms within brick and mortar. This is similar to BOPIS, but more to verify th=
at an item is available before a<br>
<br>
customer heads into the retail space.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4) What is in your supply chain (and where) is another obvious one we alrea=
dy covered, hitting both Ship From Store and Store to Store.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Avery has heard that there is an RFID project kicking off at Estee called S=
ecure and Connect (I believe this is being initiated by Chris Clark VP of G=
Lobal Supply Chain), which is still in the early exploratory stages. It mig=
ht be worth kicking up a conversation<br>
<br>
about the above to see if they can be additive or could piggyback on the ef=
fort to create more learning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me know about the above, thanks again, and best of luck in navigating w=
hat promises to be an interesting summer!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All best,<br>
<br>
<br>
Josh<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Avery has also heard that Estee is looking at machine vision (PUF or P=
hysically Unclonable Function) as a tool for unique identity and track and =
trace - again, to hit the authenticity issue you mentioned on the phone. Th=
ey&#39;ve got some significant concerns<br>
<br>
about the tech (and would clearly like to sell you an alternative). Let me =
know if a contrary opinion would be useful in proving/disproving PUF!<u></u=
