Glad you're all safe and sound!

We're still working through porting out #'s to google voice. It's actually
harder for us b/c we have an inherited google suite which they're doing
their best to neuter, but you should be able to set up a google account,
connect it to (a single) google voice #, and then port your cell # to that
google voice account. Then you tie that into the google hangouts app on
your phone. Viola! When calls to your old cell # are made it rings through
to google hangouts on your phone, and same with texts. Costs $20 to do the
port.

That's the theory, anyway. Haven't done it yet myself. Let me know if you
have any luck and I'll keep you posted as soon as I get it wrapped on my
end!

I'm in the far north speaking on a panel today (WTF PANDEMIC) but am around
next week!

all best,
Josh
