Hey all, I want to share my opinion and kind of pose a question about remote=
/blended choice.

We=E2=80=99re coming from Serbia and the Balkans that had a turbulent past, a=
nd during times kids K-12 lost months and months of school because of war or=
 protests=E2=80=A6 That didn=E2=80=99t affect the long run education of all u=
s. So, we=E2=80=99re not concerned about our 7 years old daughter's educatio=
n at the moment. There are decades of academic challenges in front of her. I=
t=E2=80=99d be good if we take sacrifice and downsize our wants, without com=
promising our values off course, and be happy if we go through this in good p=
hysical and mental health.

Eleanor Veno, our daughter=E2=80=99s teacher in the 1st grade, had an excell=
ent online school, and we can=E2=80=99t prize her enough for her effort and r=
esults. Our daughter was engaged. She learned a lot and had fun. I would sig=
n up for the same program in the heartbeat. We are afraid if we sign up for t=
he remotely to get a non EB teacher and her experience might be totally diff=
erent. The other option is to send her to a very different school like exper=
ience, that comes with a bunch of  COVID restrictions hard for her to follow=
 and potential scare that her behavior might jeopardize our health. The main=
 reason for us to consider going to school is to get her in social contact w=
ith other kids bc of mental health.=20

We respect everyone=E2=80=99s choices but during these challenging times don=
=E2=80=99t underestimate the danger. We believe that only in exceptional cas=
es kids should have an option to go to school like:  essential workers kids,=
 homeless, without food or similar economic hardship, with domestic violence=
, kids with disabilities that need in person school, and similar extreme cas=
es. How many of us are working from home and happy that we don=E2=80=99t nee=
d to go to work with others under these Corona conditions and getting on the=
 MTA. Everyone who is working from home shouldn=E2=80=99t request a teacher t=
o go to work in school because his kid is with his parent(s) safe and sound -=
 probably with less attention or more screen-time but IMO making less harm t=
hat way than jeopardizing a whole society's health. We might be able to stay=
 where we are right now (flattening the curve) and keep seeing each other in=
 our bubbles and our kids have some in person activities with a few kids aro=
und. Instead of bringing back over 600 people dying per night, jeopardizing m=
edical staff, and we become again all shut down and not seeing our =E2=80=9C=
bubble communities=E2=80=9D. We might not be able to satisfy every corner of=
 the EB community but IMO less ppl will suffer this way than when we are all=
 shut down. Like in an airplane, =E2=80=9Cput the mask first to yourself the=
n to your kid=E2=80=9D. So then we can come together as a community and also=
 help those who are left behind if that happens.=20

So, what do you choose, if Josh said if you have any doubt of going blended t=
hen pick that, as remotely will not give you an option to change your mind? I=
 believe there are so many of us with 90% belief that remotely is the choice=
, but we want to wait for a month to see if that might change. This is the w=
eirdest time ever and my thoughts and decisions are changing every week.

Is it possible that Ella Baker can organize another survey with our real fee=
ling choices but that won=E2=80=99t make us obligated to DOE if we change ou=
r mind about blended/remotely choice? If we as a school make a real choice s=
urvey and present it to DOE? Thanks for reading this long post and sharing y=
our thoughts!=
