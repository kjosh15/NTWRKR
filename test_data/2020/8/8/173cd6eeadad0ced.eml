Isn=E2=80=99t our active directory instance by instance? I.e., the front en=
d
instance is our sole integration with customers, meaning each instance is a
separate active directory, each of which can have a SSO integration for the
client. If that=E2=80=99s the case, having a =E2=80=9Cvendor neutral=E2=80=
=9D SSO saves us a lot of
trouble, no? What am I missing?
