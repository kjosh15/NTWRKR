The full, detailed accounting (just to keep myself accountable):<br>
<br>
I&#39;m continuing to dismantle my life in NYC; we&#39;d prefer to keep our=
 apartment there but may end up losing it. Remote moving is a bitch! More f=
ormally:<br>
<br>
1. Takeda Pharmaceuticals. They have a statement of work and I&#39;m hoping=
 to hear back soon to formalize a contract to build their HR IT / Data Stra=
tegy as well as help determine what key metrics they need to drive it. (Hel=
lo, Indigometrics!)<br>
<br>
2. Network. Website is updated and I&#39;m now polishing my whitepaper on t=
his networking approach as well as my CGM embedded sensor project pitch dec=
k. Then I&#39;ll set up GMail for a merged multivariate outreach protocol t=
o my network of ~3k people to see if it
 generates interest in contracting me, in IndigoMetrics, or in one of these=
 projects. Right now launch is planned for after Labor Day, when most of Eu=
rope returns from summer break, the US is back working, and the IndigoMetri=
cs.com website is updated.<br>
<br>
3. IndigoMetrics. Our biggest contract is moving into stage II and we&#39;r=
e negotiating final pricing for a company-wide rollout (50k employees). Int=
erest continues as I talk to other companies; we should have a new pitch de=
ck and website in another week or so
 which I expect to have a big impact on the sales process!<br>
