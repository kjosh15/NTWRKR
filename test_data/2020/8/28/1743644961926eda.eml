Hi,

It must be such a relief to have found an ideal travel situation for the cat=
s. I=E2=80=99m happy for you all and B&A! We will certainly miss them but kn=
ow that this is best for everyone/cat involved.=20

October 1st, unfortunately, probably doesn=E2=80=99t work for a vet=E2=80=99=
s visit at this point. My tentative schedule has me teaching every Thursday a=
nd Friday. This might change - I will know by the end of next week. I=E2=80=99=
ll also know the kids=E2=80=99 counseling schedule by then. Can I let you kn=
ow by next Friday? If you don=E2=80=99t hear from me, please feel free to ca=
ll or email again!=20

In any case, I am more than willing to miss a day of teaching on a Thursday i=
f need be!

If you need anything else from me, please let me know (would you like for me=
 to deliver the cats to the couple - are they leaving from LGa? Or will they=
 come and get the cats? - if I=E2=80=99m teaching again on the day of flight=
, I can possibly enlist Gustavo=E2=80=99s help. He=E2=80=99s okay around the=
 cats for a short amount of time.)

Take care!
Sonali
