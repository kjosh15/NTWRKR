Josh,



Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support,



There were no reports of issues on the Grid Services on the morning of Aug.
26th, 2020, that would have prevented a connection to indigometrics.com on
the server.  If you were not seeing the same behavior on the site when
reported by the client, it is likely that there was a network router
between the clients location and the host server that is encountering high
connection times or time outs that could trigger the error message
reported.  To check for issues along the network pathway to the server the
client can run a traceroute to the server using the information in the
following article.



Using the traceroute command

services, please feel free to contact us at any time.



Best regards,
