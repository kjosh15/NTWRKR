Hope you're well in this *very* strange time. From what I'm hearing things
are starting to accelerate - what I want to know most is how we can
capitalize on this acceleration to make the most of this window of change!

*Here's my (TL;DR) updates: Waiting on Takeda to formalize a contract.
Personal website updated, and am updating two other project summaries and
formalizing my media outreach to begin after labor day (to coincide with
the Indigometrics.com site update). *

If you get a chance, let me know what you think of the new site (www.josh.is)
and otherwise let me know if you have a moment to connect in the next
couple weeks!

All best wishes,
Josh

The full, detailed accounting (just to keep myself accountable):

I'm continuing to dismantle my life in NYC; we'd prefer to keep our
apartment there but may end up losing it. Remote moving is a bitch! More
formally:

1. Takeda Pharmaceuticals. They have a statement of work and I'm hoping to
hear back soon to formalize a contract to build their HR IT / Data Strategy
as well as help determine what key metrics they need to drive it. (Hello,
Indigometrics!)

2. Network. Website is updated and I'm now polishing my whitepaper on this
networking approach as well as my CGM embedded sensor project pitch deck.
Then I'll set up GMail for a merged multivariate outreach protocol to my
network of ~3k people to see if it generates interest in contracting me, in
IndigoMetrics, or in one of these projects. Right now launch is planned for
after Labor Day, when most of Europe returns from summer break, the US is
back working, and the IndigoMetrics.com website is updated.

3. IndigoMetrics. Our biggest contract is moving into stage II and we're
negotiating final pricing for a company-wide rollout (50k employees).
Interest continues as I talk to other companies; we should have a new pitch
deck and website in another week or so which I expect to have a big impact
on the sales process!
