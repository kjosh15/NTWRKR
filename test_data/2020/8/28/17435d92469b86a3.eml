This is great, thanks! I'd love an introduction to Bill if you think he'd
find it useful. I'd be very curious to compare notes on the role of data in
managing/nurturing ethical behavior in the organization and to hear what
his consultancy is advising reg. same.

In the meantime, I'll connect with BoardEx and see that my materials are
included, and will rework my board resume as per the template you provided.
Look to hear from me as soon as that is done - probably not within the next
few weeks as I'm closing out a project, but hopefully not long after.

Very much obliged,
Josh
