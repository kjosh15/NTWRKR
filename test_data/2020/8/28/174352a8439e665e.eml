Absolutely no worries - we know you have your hands full and are grateful
for your help.

We=E2=80=99re talking with Gustavo tomorrow and hope to nail everything els=
e down
then. (As much as is possible, anyway!)

We have an appointment with Noah=E2=80=99s Ark veterinarian on Oct 1 at 3pm=
. If
that doesn=E2=80=99t work please let us know when would on that day or the =
next and
we=E2=80=99ll try to reschedule.

We=E2=80=99ve been looking for someone to fly the cats to Seattle and found=
 a young
couple who want to go for her mother=E2=80=99s birthday on Oct 9 - hence th=
e
timing. It turns out that finding people who want to fly right now is
pretty difficult, and it=E2=80=99s both unsafe and hard to find airlines th=
at=E2=80=99ll
fly them as cargo (as well as being impossibly expensive...)

Let me know if that all makes sense and if it all works for you!

- J
