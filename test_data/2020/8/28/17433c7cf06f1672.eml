municated and both were waiting on the other for feedback... (!!)<br><br>Re=
ally appreciate your open-mindedness in exploring options! I think there&#3=
9;s a few constraints we need to note up front, and may have to take things=
 in stages, but that we ought to start with what could work best for all of=
 us as we figure it out. I&#39;m going to put out everything we know here f=
irst (so we both know exactly what we&#39;re talking about) and then offer =
some options. <br><br>We&#39;re managing three big things:<br><br>1) Gettin=
g the cats to Seattle. We may have a friend of a friend interested in comin=
g from Seattle and then returning; we should know more about this later tod=
ay/tomorrow. If that doesn&#39;t pan out then we&#39;d love to have you tak=
e them; as we understand it there&#39;s no quarantine requirements in eithe=
r Washington state nor NYC (see <a href=3D"https://www.portseattle.org/node=
/11309" target=3D"_blank">https://www.portseattle.org/node/11309</a> under =
&quot;What are the quarantine guidelines following travel?&quot; &gt; &quot=
;Domestic Travel.&quot;) That said, it&#39;s likely you&#39;d have to find =
a place for you and your son to stay at least a night in Seattle before hea=
ding back. If you&#39;re going anyway you might as well visit the city and =
hike the cascades / see the rainforests a little!!<br><br>If you&#39;re sti=
ll interested in this, we&#39;d have to figure out what&#39;s needed for yo=
u to fly with them; we have two soft carriers which we think should work fo=
r flying with them under your seats on Jet Blue. I think we&#39;d have to h=
ave them taken to the vet a week before you fly, but have a friend that we =
can ask to take them.<br><br>2) Shipping stuff. Near term, we&#39;re having=
 boxes and vacuum packing bags shipped to the house, and have a spreadsheet=
 listing the items we wanted to have shipped. We&#39;d need to have that st=
uff put in the boxes and the boxes weighed, then we can buy shipping and ha=
ve the labels sent to you to put on the boxes before pickup.<br><br>Longer =
term, we&#39;d need to have our personal items packed up for storage (books=
, pictures, stuff like that). There isn&#39;t a huge amount of this, and th=
e good news is that if we can work things out for a longer term arrangement=
 it would basically be giving you back a lot of space while leaving everyth=
ing you need to run the home.<br><br>3) The lease. We&#39;re still asking f=
or a copy of the lease renewal - they&#39;re required by law to give us one=
 at this point, but they&#39;re dragging their heels (probably hoping thing=
s work out legislatively in their favor). I&#39;m going to ask them to give=
 us a 1/2 price rate for 6 months (so $1,125/month). Other monthly home exp=
enses are:<br><br>ConEd (electricity): $100<br>National Grid (gas): $20<br>=
Allstate (renter&#39;s insurance): $16<br>Time Warner Cable (internet): $65=
<br>-----<br>Total: $201/month<br><br><br>Here are some potential options:<=
br><br>A) If our FOAF can fly in and pick up the cats, ideal - we&#39;re wo=
rking on this now as I&#39;d rather spare you the errand + the claritin! If=
 that doesn&#39;t work, if you can fly them to Seattle we&#39;re happy to p=
ay the flight ticket for yourself and your son (or whoever else you go with=
!) Obviously we don&#39;t have a ton of cash either so would ask that it be=
 Jet Blue or whatever else is most price effective. We&#39;d pay for whatev=
er shots or carriers or whatever the cats need, of course, and probably hav=
e a friend that can take them to the vet in advance.<br><br>B) Once we get =
the cats out, we&#39;d be more than happy to have you stay at our place for=
 September if you can help us get everything packed up. No need to pay for =
anything other than utilities for this month as we&#39;re having the money =
come out of our deposit anyway and frankly we&#39;d both be doing each othe=
r a favor. That should be enough!!<br><br>C) If we can get our lease renewe=
d for $1,125 we&#39;d be happy if you could pay $500 plus the utilities for=
 Oct-Dec. It sounds like you may want to move somewhere else in the new yea=
r, and we may want to move back - but that&#39;s a bridge several months aw=
ay yet and we&#39;re happy to negotiate that when we get closer to it!<br><=
br><br>Let us know what you think about the above, and sorry to send so muc=
h text. I figured I&#39;d put everything in writing so we nothing gets over=
looked or assumed - right now certainty is in short supply! As you said in =
our call today we&#39;re both looking for a win/win here, so feel free to s=
uggest anything, ask anything, or give feedback to adjust any of the above.=
