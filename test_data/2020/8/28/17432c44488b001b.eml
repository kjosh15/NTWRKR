Josh,

We are reaching out today with a reminder about an upcoming change to your GRID service. To improve the security and reliability of the GRID, we are removing the older, unsupported 5.6 version of PHP on September 30, 2020.

 

In July, we began this process by moving PHP version 5.6 to the "Legacy" option under PHP Settings in your GRID Control Panel. We hope that this phased approach has provided you with the time needed to complete any necessary updates to your sites, as we are approaching the final removal of PHP 5.6.

 

What does this mean for you?

For the vast majority of websites, this change should be relatively transparent, as modern web applications such as WordPress have been updated to work well with the latest versions of PHP.

 

Why is this happening?

To improve security for our entire GRID hosting platform, removing unsupported and insecure versions of software is essential.

The PHP Group established PHP 5.6 as an unsupported branch as of December 2018, however Media Temple has continued to support customers who built on this version for your convenience.

https://www.php.net/eol.php

 

What version of PHP are you using right now?

We have a handy Community article on how to check the version of PHP for each site in your GRID hosting, using your Media Temple Account Center.

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204643520/how-can-i-specify-the-php-version-on-the-grid

If your application does not work correctly after the update, you should check to make sure that the code is compatible with PHP 7.3. Enabling additional error logging may help provide some insight into any application issues you are having and this article provides you more details.

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204403804/where-are-the-access_log-and-error_log-files-for-my-server?

 

It's worth noting that there are some deprecated features that should have little impact on a majority of websites, but in the case that your website is not yet prepared for the upcoming change, we highly recommend doing the following:

 

1.  Take a remote backup of your site using FTP (or SSH if preferred)

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204404294/backup-options#3

2. Build a staging site

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204645480/how-to-create-staging-sites

3. Testing and troubleshooting your site using PHP 7.3. This may require additional assistance from a developer if necessary. Taking a look at your error logs may help, which we have multiple guides for here:

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204403804/where-are-the-access_log-and-error_log-files-for-my-server

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/360020711631/how-to-enable-php-error-logging-via-php.ini

 

For many of you that host WordPress websites, WordPress offers much more information on the transition to the latest PHP versions here:

https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/

 

For the comprehensive list of PHP changes:
