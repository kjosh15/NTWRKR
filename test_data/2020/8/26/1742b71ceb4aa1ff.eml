Tim,

Thanks again for an excellent call earlier; it's hard to get a sense of a
person in such a short time and you did an amazing job of both that and
covering a number of topics of mutual interest.

In return, please find attached my board resume (and presskit, for
comparison). More information is available at www.josh.is. It sounds as
though Preng might be an ideal partner in finding the kind of position I'm
looking for: to your point, most of the encouragement to take a board seat
is coming from friends who are currently or recently senior leaders of very
large multinationals, all of whom acknowledge that to get to that level you
need to have evidence from other independent directors. As you noted, that
requires having served together, which is easier to start with a mid-sized
entity.

In terms of methanol, I'd be very curious to learn more. Based on the very
brief overview it seems as though you're crystal clear on the value of an
integrated systems approach to both data collection and process
automation/optimization. There are a ton of ways to slice that particular
pie, and even more ways to turn the insights you'll be able to gather into
marketable properties. Let me know when you're in a position to discuss
further!

Finally, in terms of ethics the organization you work with sounds very
progressive - and increasingly needed. I co-founded a platform that uses
peer-to-peer evaluations to generate longitudinal statistical models of
behaviors and beliefs based on the core values of an organization, and have
found that - especially since the pandemic began - companies are starting
to grab a hold of the value of these models with both hands. Let me know if
it's worth discussing further.

Much obliged,
Josh
