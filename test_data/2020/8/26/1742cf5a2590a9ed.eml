I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "the value of qualitative data
evaluations via voice", so it's hard to offer an opinion.=20

Right now, voice is most useful as an alternate input method where
keyboard input is inconvenient. Mostly on mobile devices.=20

Recognizing the words within a limited domain (which sounds like your
use case) is very feasible, and with good training data we can hit 95%+
word accuracy (at least in English) without much difficulty. We're
working on rolling out to other languages, but building an ASR for a new
language is a substantial undertaking so we'll be at it for a long time
yet.=20

Understanding what the words mean is a whole different game. Obviously
we have to do that too for digital assistant (chatbot) purposes, but
that's a separate step. Most such "intent determination" is aimed at Q&A
chatbots and dialogue interactions to help users complete specific tasks
(e.g. get your bank balance, then move money between accounts). Intent
determination is pretty good there, though I'm not up on how accurate it
generally is. Good enough for production use, anyway. But again, much
depends on your training data.=20

Your situation sounds more similar to sentiment analysis to me. A
combination of that plus intent determination would probably go a long
way towards classifying statements in your p2p evaluations in whatever
way is useful to you.=20

Another thing that works quite well is harvesting information from user
utterances (whether given by voice or typed in, doesn't matter). Several
months ago we did a fire-drill exercise to build a doctor assistant
chatbot for COVID in-patient and outpatient monitoring. We had to handle
utterances like "Note that Jane Doe's temp is up to 102.4 today with
mild pertussis. She's on ibuprofen for the pyrexia but not on
supplemental O2 at this time", and from that, harvest stuff like:=20

{ "patient": "Jane Doe", "temperature": "104.2F", "symptoms":
["pertussis"], "medications": ["ibuprofen"], "supp_oyxgen": false}=20

If your evaluations are aimed at collecting some set of variable:value
pairs for later analysis, Oracle's chatbot infrastructure handles it
quite well.=20

If I could live anywhere? That's a good question, but two places that
I'm drawn to are the south of France or somewhere on the coast in Italy.
Though I hear Spain is really inexpensive these days. Sometimes it's
tempting to just sell everything, pick up stakes, and buy some little
cottage near some little town where it's quiet and nothing ever happens,
and just chill out and write novels all day long. Maybe take the
occasional editing client to keep a little money rolling in, or maybe
get a place where we could do the B&B thing for tourists. But with what
we could probably get for our house here, maybe even that would be
optional...

<div style=3D"font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;">I need to get my two=
 cats from NYC to my sister in Seattle. We have an empty apartment in NYC, =
and can buy tickets for two folks who want to go to NYC for a few days befo=
re bringing the cats back with them. WA is one of the few states NOT on the=
 quarantine list for NYC, so you could just show up and as long as you wear=
 a mask (the same way you would in SEA) you can do as you like. Do you have=
 anyone you'd trust/recommend who might be interested? We're keen to get th=
