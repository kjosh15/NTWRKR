Congrats on the new gig! Sounds interesting; I'm very curious to hear
how/where speech reco is going to have the biggest impact. FWIW, I've got a
startup involved in measuring culture (alignment/engagement with core
corporate values using peer-to-peer evaluations) that's growing pretty
nicely - moving to voice is def. in our future, but I'd be curious about
your take on the value of qualitative data evaluations via voice.

As for Iceland, that's TBD. We've been trying to hang on to our NYC apt.,
but it's starting to look pretty bad. That, plus I have citizenship here so
once vaccines are widely distributed (hopefully by the end of this school
year) we can go anywhere in the EU. A lot depends on the pending election,
let's just say that. If you could live anywhere where would *you* go?

All best wishes,
Josh
