Firstly, thanks for a wonderful weekend in Isafjordur!! I had a wonderful
time and can't stop thinking about all the opportunities up there. Looking
forward to next steps...

In terms of the talks, I'd be happy to! If you could tell me more about the
audience, the intended outcome, when you need them, etc. that would all be
helpful. (Especially if you think it'd be helpful in finding opportunities
in startup/tech related courses.)

All best,
Josh
