Sonali,

I hope you and your girls are as well as possible, all things considered!!
I wanted to check in and update you on our conversation with Gustavo, plans
for the cats, etc.

Right now we're planning to have Gustavo move in Sept. 1. He is going to
help us get all our personal stuff packed up, and hopefully we'll be able
to negotiate a lease extension with our landlord so he can stay on through
the end of the year.

In the meantime, my sister is still available to take the cats, and there's
a young couple in Brooklyn who can fly with them to her en route to
visiting their mom on/around Oct 9th. We'd need the cats to get to the vet
within ten days before the flight to get updated health certificates, etc.

So! A few questions:

1. Can you move the cats and their stuff to your place before September 1?
2. Does early October work for you to say goodbye to the cats?
3. Can you bring the cats to the vet before then?

As ever, let us know what we can do to help support you and yours. We're
thinking of you often and sending all our love and best wishes.

yours,
Josh
