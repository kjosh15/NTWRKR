So my argument is that legally we don=E2=80=99t have a problem with =
their standard language because there is no way (as long as we =
don=E2=80=99t do anything silly) they could prove to a judge that what =
we are doing with their data isn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cnecessary to provide =
the services=E2=80=9D.

However think we also need to manage the commercial challenge =E2=80=93 =
ie the risk that they get annoyed with how we use data and decide to =
stop using our platform.

So the question is =E2=80=93 in order to manage our commercial risk =
would it be a good idea to have an open conversation about how we use =
data now?

I know that the answer is that it would not be a good idea to have a =
conversation with Misha about it =E2=80=93 because he has already stated =
that his view is =E2=80=9CI know you are doing it but don=E2=80=99t try =
and put it in the contract =E2=80=93 that would be rude and would =
suggest we should get free access=E2=80=9D.

Worth talking to David about? Think my answer would also be no =E2=80=93 =
risks rocking the boat without really achieving much =E2=80=93 in =
particular before we have agreed a cost number =E2=80=93 because they =
will argue that they should use the platform for free in return for the =
calibration services.

I agree with you on this; IANAL (another service we could really use =
more of here) but my take is that if we include some language about =
constantly improving our models, attempting to be best in class, =
providing a market competitive service, etc. then doing updates based on =
metadata is a given. I.e., yes, I think Bechtel's language is fine IF we =
elsewhere make it clear that we need to use all the data at our disposal =
to constantly improve our platform... for customers like Bechtel.

J,

So the reason I added our standard =E2=80=9Cmodel calibration =
clause=E2=80=9D (which essentially says we can compare Bechtel data to =
other customer=E2=80=99s data but only in tokenized form and without =
identifying the source) into the Bechtel SaaS contract was because the =
Bechtel draft has this line in it (slight paraphrase):

=20

=E2=80=9CBechtel hereby grants the Vendor a right to use the Bechtel =
Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services to =
Bechtel=E2=80=9D

=20

I am thinking to take the model calibration wording out and just operate =
under the standard Bechtel contract.

=20

The alternative would be to negotiate a watered down model calibration =
and data usage paragraph =E2=80=93 but Misha has already flagged they =
would want wording stating the we run separately calibrated algorithms =
for Bechtel (which is a bit daft in my opinion).

=20

So the question becomes =E2=80=93 do we actually do anything that =
contravenes the =E2=80=9Csolely to the extent necessary to provide the =
Services to Bechtel=E2=80=9D .

=20

Think this probably comes down to being careful about how we describe =
what we are doing to Bechtel.

=20

The learning algorithms learn at an individual participant level and at =
a scheme level =E2=80=93 with some data then used to inform the =
algorithm seeds across the entire platform =E2=80=93 but it would be =
really difficult for them to argue that that contravenes their clause. =
If they were that worried they wouldn=E2=80=99t allow their employees to =
use google=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6..

=20

We also use cross customer data in the marketing packs =E2=80=93 for =
example in =E2=80=9Caverage time to respond=E2=80=9D etc=20

=20

Don=E2=80=99t intend to revert to Misha until Wednesday =E2=80=93 so =
some time to ponder =E2=80=93 comments welcome.
