Long time no speak! These last few years I've been focused on technology
strategy and consulting to large corporations, but based on my experience
living in NYC in the heart of the pandemic it feels like the time to create
impact with more nimble entities and I'd love to get your take on what's
happening in the space. Let me know if you're around in the next few weeks
to reconnect!

All best,
Josh
