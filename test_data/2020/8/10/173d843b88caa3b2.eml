Think we've covered this at length, but wanted to add that my understanding
was that Amazon's SSO acted as an integration platform for whatever
authentication system your client used. I.e., once you've defined the roles
and rights of a class of user, you could use SSO to allow clients access
using their own authentication. Again, once we're fully AWS for each client
this will be a big time savings.
