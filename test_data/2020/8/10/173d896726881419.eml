Hi Josh,


I have spoken with my colleagues (tax specialists) as we talked about and
we have the following information for you.

As you are now a resident in Iceland you will have unlimited tax liability
here. That means taxes are levied on world wide income. We would therefore
recommend you form an Icelandic LLC. We can assist you with that.

If you are mainly selling your services abroad you will not have to collect
VAT of the sale but nevertheless obligated to register for VAT and file VAT
reports. You will be able to claim input VAT but not to add output VAT on
sales. Note that we have to verify this when we receive detailed
information about the work performed.

We are not specialists in US taxes and would have to suggest you contact a
specialist regarding whether there is a special taxation on income taxed
abroad.


If you want more detailed answers or further assistance we would gladly
help you after signing an engagement letter.

Kind regards,
