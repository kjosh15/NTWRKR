Shared is when your pets will travel in the transport vehicle with a
trained driver and up to 5 other pets doing drop offs and pick ups just
like yours. Drivers will make stops to check on pets along the way; gas
stops;food; bathroom breaks for dogs if there are any and we only use pet
friendly hotels so your pet(s) can also come inside over night. Each pet
will be in there own kennel. from NYC to Seattle with 2 pets prices at
$2539.00
Private transport would be similar to shared ride except it will only be
your pets riding with the trained driver door to door only stopping at pet
friendly hotels and things of that nature. We can have the cats in the
largest kennel offer to give them my space to feel comfortable.Also much
faster service due to the fact that it's only your pets riding.  from NYC
to Seattle with 2 pets prices at 5732.00
Flight transport would be 1600.00 each pet. Which would include a flight
nanny receiving your pet at the first airport all the way to the
destination airport. your pet would be escorted in cabin flight the whole
time in the flight nannies care. You would only need to supply your pets
carrier and have people in place to drop off and pick up your pet at each
airport.
I can go into greater details over the phone if you have any questions or
concerns (321) 289-3230
