I agree with you on this; IANAL (another service we could really use more
of here) but my take is that if we include some language about constantly
improving our models, attempting to be best in class, providing a market
competitive service, etc. then doing updates based on metadata is a given.
I.e., yes, I think Bechtel's language is fine IF we elsewhere make it clear
that we need to use all the data at our disposal to constantly improve our
platform... for customers like Bechtel.
