Since we talked, I have had so many thoughts that I have not had the =
time to put into words! I=E2=80=99ll get them to you but maybe in drips =
and drabs.

Yesterday, I was on the phone with my best friend from early years in =
college. Her mother died recently. The mother was a Mexican illegal who =
became a housecleaner then the husband of her father who was a Texas =
developer. Sort of the typical rags to riches illegal migration story. =
Yet, of course, it wasn=E2=80=99t.

Anyway, she is also thinking of leaving USA. As I said to you, I told =
her one will never find the kind of diversity we enjoyed on the coasts =
of America. Perhaps, that=E2=80=99s what you will miss the most. At the =
same time, let=E2=80=99s face reality a bit. This diversity in =
progressive urban areas of America are bubbles of aspirational =
possibility funded by a system of global extractive capitalism which =
weaponizes ethnic/race division for competitive corporate benefit. So, =
we can choose to attain enough privilege through wealth or other means =
to live in that gated community, or we can try to teach our kids to =
struggle in the real world while aspiring for something better.

Maybe on another call, I should tell you about the incredible experience =
I had in such a bubble. My hippie, artist high school was such a place. =
It produced just from my years, Gabrielle Hamilton (chef/owner Prune), =
Alessandro Rossellini (Roberto=E2=80=99s grandson and Isabella=E2=80=99s =
nephew), Ignazio Carona (designer/owner Massimo fashion), Boris =
Izaguirre (Spain/Latin America=E2=80=99s biggest fashion tv =
personality), Sean McCook (World Cup equestrian), and of course me! :-) =
But, the black kids from Trentons ghettos who went there on scholarship =
describe it repeatedly and emotionally as the best years of their life. =
Faculty sex abuse of students over decades has also been uncovered. Like =
Hollywood, it=E2=80=99s another one of these dream factory bubbles that =
is amazing while inside, but often leaves the most defenseless =
unprepared for struggles outside=E2=80=A6 Almost like a cult family.

In addition, as I also mentioned, I feel I learned racism in USA. Of =
course, if a black or even white kid came to my school in Japan, =
they=E2=80=99d face xenophobia or racism or bullying or discrimination =
or whatever you want to call it. And, diversity or encounters with the =
other, doesn=E2=80=99t make things better in and of itself. In fact, as =
you know, black neighborhoods next to Korean (for example) only deepened =
divides for the most part (though there are many individual exceptions). =
For me, having a =E2=80=9Cmulti-racial=E2=80=9D kid, maybe it=E2=80=99s =
easier to talk about being teased for having slanted eyes or whatever =
and connecting it to gender, obesity, bullying, and other forms of =
discrimination, prejudice, and bias. Also, being Korean and Japanese, =
I=E2=80=99m talking to Ma=C3=ABl about war bringing enemies in contact, =
and how that leads to people like us who have both sides inside us, etc. =
White folks think Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are the same, but we =
know they are different, etc, etc. It comes up naturally. Also, raising =
M with dogs, I can always talk about how I had to train the dogs around =
different races, genders, and abilities, because dogs can become afraid =
of what they don=E2=80=99t know.=20

Anyway, I hope this doesn=E2=80=99t seem just like babbling. My point is =
I believe we can and need to train our kids to tolerance for difference =
without access all the time to a full range of diversity. The biggest =
issue is disavowal of power. Might doesn=E2=80=99t make right, and its =
subtle and unsubtle forms of violence/power inflicted on others with =
less that form the crux of discrimination.

Okay, I=E2=80=99m out of time for now, but Berlin, Amsterdam, =
Copenhagen, Brussels all sound like places where you and fam might =
thrive. I=E2=80=99m supposed to meet up with Jamie this week. Did you =
reach him? I mentioned sending him to you.

Look forward to some beers together soon!

Ps Reading a book called White Fragility that came out recently. Perhaps =
worth skimming. More soon!
