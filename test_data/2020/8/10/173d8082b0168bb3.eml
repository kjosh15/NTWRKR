It was my pleasure! I'm very keen to learn more about shamanism in our next
call; I apprenticed under a khabbalistic mage when I was a teenager and
feel like it provided an excellent framework despite being too structured a
practice for me to sustain at the time.

Along those same lines, I was thinking about how you described interacting
with the world and how it reminded me that I personally felt like I had an
approach to the world first, and technology as a tool second (which is not
how most of my peers in this industry see it.) It may be that thinking of
ourselves as magicians who use certain contexts/language/cognitive or
psychosocial frameworks to prompt evolution is a more solvent way to tackle
the problem of making change.

Looking forward to our next conversation! Let me know when suits.

Thank you so much for the conversation. There is=C2=A0 much to say, but mos=

I also heard what you said about trying things. Good idea. <br>
I was lucky to go to the beach after we talked as I needed a bit of time an=
d ocean floating to integrate it all, known and felt. So, I didn=E2=80=99t =
yet open your email with your writing, but I will soon. Have learned to pac=

I will ask for more face to face. :) <br>
Touch base anytime,<br>
