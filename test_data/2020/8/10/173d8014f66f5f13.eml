Michael,

Feels like we're spinning our wheels on the contract a bit; I think we're
in agreement around the intent of the free trials but going back and forth
with the lawyer is taking forever. Maybe =E2=80=9Cincluding free trials sub=
ject to
the approval of IndigoMetrics, not unreasonably withheld=E2=80=9D or simila=
r
language would do it?

best,
Josh
=E1=90=A7
