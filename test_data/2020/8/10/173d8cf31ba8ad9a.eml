Allen,

Here's a draft of the email blast I'm planning to send out once my website
is updated. I'll include embedded links for each of the points below, but
wanted to get your overall take before I started making derivatives for
multivariate testing (excellent suggestion, BTW!)

Hope you're well; thanks for all the help!
-J


#######

As the pandemic has worn on I've been trying to figure out how we can all
make better use of our networks. To that end, I thought I'd drop you a
short message to see if I can help  or if one of my projects might be
useful to you.

At present I can help with:

- Access to a world-class network of senior executives
- Insight into a variety of new and emerging technologies
- Connections to film/tv shooting, VC, energy, and cloud opportunities in
Iceland

I'm currently working on:

- IndigoMetrics; a SaaS platform for measuring behavior and beliefs in
employees. Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!
- Virtual Circles; a theory on how to use our networks better in a more
highly-virtualized world. This is the thinking behind this email!
- CGM Testing; a project to understand how to use physically embedded
sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and
diabetes (and hence Covid!)

And as ever I'm offering professionally:

- Technology and innovation strategy for early-stage startups and
corporations,
- Innovation Coaching for senior leaders and key staff,
- Advising, both board, startup, and for key initiatives around technology
and innovation.

In times like these it's more important than ever to help each other.
Please feel free to follow up with me if any of the above are useful to
you, or just to say hi!

All best wishes,
Josh
