One of the best things the pandemics did for me was prompt me to start
reconnecting with the good people I know more regularly. I don't have a
business ask, but would love to chat briefly just to get up to speed and to
see how/if I could be of help. Let me know if you have 30m in the next few
weeks to compare notes!

All best wishes,
Josh
