Julie,

I've got a few pics that'll give you an idea of the space; they're not
comprehensive, but do they help in at least making a guesstimate? Again,
we'd want to move everything *except* for furniture and clothing into
storage for 6 months to a year while we get set up somewhere else, and then
have it shipped to us (likely by boat as that'd be cheaper).

The apartment has two bedrooms, a living room, dining room, kitchen, and
bathroom. There are some delicate keepsakes (a glass swan, an old wooden
babushka, etc.) but nothing extraordinarily valuable. Can you tell us:

- A rough estimate on packing costs
- A rough idea of cost for storage
- If you can manage shipping from the storage location to Europe
- What is a Certificate of insurance?

Thanks!!

- J

ville Ny for longterm storage needs, but it is an insulated cinderblock str=
