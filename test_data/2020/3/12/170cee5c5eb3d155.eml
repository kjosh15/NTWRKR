As per our conversations with Megan, we=E2=80=99re using WordPress. The
documentation on your site refers to an outdated, insecure version of
WordPress and further, the instructions on javascript upload and insertion,
insert code samples, and configurations are all incorrect and do not
function.

Again, as per our conversations with your tech support we were able to
hand-insert the necessary javascripts and reference them, but the iframe
inserts are still not operating correctly and are throwing numerous errors.

The most immediate issue *which must get resolved today* is that the class
schedule page is only showing the types of classes, and not the actual
schedule. I expect this is a setup issue on your end - please advise.
