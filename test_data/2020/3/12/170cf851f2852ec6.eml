 it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any m=
etal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 6. O=
n fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill i=
t. 7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liq=
uids with ice. 8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on y=
our hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you ca=
n rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 9. You should also ga=
rgle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 1=

re throat lasting 3 / 4 days 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid tha=
t enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about=
 5 / 6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty i=
n breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel l=
ike you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.=20

                  <br>
                  Last evening dining out with friends, one of their
                  uncles, who's graduated with a master's degree and who
                  worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province,
                  China) sent him the following notes on Coronavirus for
                  guidance:<br>
                  <br>
                  1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a
                  common cold 2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough
                  with no runny nose. 3. This new virus is not
                  heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of
                  just 26/27 degrees. 80 deg F . It hates the Sun.<br>
                  <br>
                  4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet
                  before it drops to the ground and is no longer
                  airborne. 5. If it drops on a metal surface it will
                  live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into
                  contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as
                  soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 6. On fabric it
                  can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent
                  will kill it. 7. Drinking warm water is effective for
                  all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 8.
                  Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live
                  on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen
                  during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your
                  nose unwittingly and so on. 9. You should also gargle
                  as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm
                  water will suffice. 10. Can't emphasize enough - drink
                  plenty of water! <br>
                  THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so
                  you'll have a sore throat lasting 3 / 4 days 2. The
                  virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the
                  trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This
                  takes about 5 / 6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia
                  comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The
                  nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel
                  like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek
                  immediate attention. <br>
