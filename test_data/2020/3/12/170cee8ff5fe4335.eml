hnology strategy for a major design firm, and after several years of freela=
nce consulting both of my boys are entering school full
 time. As a result, I&#39;m looking for bigger, longer term, more impactful=
 work to really sink my teeth into.
<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed your approach to business and am particularly inter=
ested in your use of careful strategy in conducting your M&amp;A, JV, and C=
VC efforts: few of the businesses I&#39;ve worked with actually practice th=
e level of rigor you describe. Would you (or
 someone else at HP) would be the right person to talk to to see if I could=
 play a role? As ever, any advice is appreciated!
<br>
<br>
Looking forward,<br>
