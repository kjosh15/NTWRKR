 Hi Josh,

In an attempt to streamline our communication, I wanted to share a
comprehensive overview of next week's COVID-19 calls. These calls are an
opportunity for you (or your team) and your World 50 peers to discuss the
impact of this issue on your organization and across the businesses with
top leaders.

*Please note that by member request, we have added two informal "huddle"
calls for members (and teams) of Innovating 50 and Digital 50 only*. While
all of the World 50 calls have been phenomenal, we wanted to also provide a
venue for members focused on growth, R&D, innovation, digital, strategy,
etc... to ask real-time questions of each other. These calls are a great
way to bring the value of membership directly to your team. If you are
unable to join, please feel free to invite a member of your team to join on
your behalf.

Details for the calls are below my signature. No negative RSVPs needed.

Stay safe!
-Mike
