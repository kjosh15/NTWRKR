Please find attached:

   - A cover letter including why I have the skills for this assignment
   - A proposal of how the research will be carried out, including a budget
   showing daily rates.
   - A curriculum vitae
   - Contact details for 3 references
   - A presskit as additional reference

Unfortunately, because almost all of my consulting work is confidential I'm
unable to provide work samples. Let me know if I can provide anything
further!

All best wishes,
Josh
