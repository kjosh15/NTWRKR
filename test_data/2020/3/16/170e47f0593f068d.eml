This looks great, but the customer in this case is extremely remedial. If
you have a plain-language summary at the very top of the document that'll
facilitate its being easy to approve by whomever we get in contact with
upstream within their org. Keep in mind, the customer was spooked given the
market prior to Covid-19, so despite knowing intuitively that this is a
critical investment you can make it easier with language targeted at a
7-year-old.

Not trying to make more work for you here - let me know if there's anything
more specific I can do to help!
