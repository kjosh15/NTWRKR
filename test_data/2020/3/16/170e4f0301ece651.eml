On a separate note, I just got off a call for World 50 members with Juan
Enriquez. He's an internationally renowned author and academic with a
special focus on biology (he was part of the team that first sequenced the
human genome). The big takeaways were that anyone who underplays the danger
of Covid-19 is playing with fire - especially older folks, and especially
over the next couple weeks. He suggested that it's not unlikely that we'll
see riots outside of hospitals by that time, here in the US, and that the
impact in less prepared countries will be even more catastrophic, and that
there may be recurring waves of infections.

So, two takeaways for you: 1. keep washing those hands, and please stay
home! And 2. Being out in the middle of nowhere may work in your favor as
long as you don't get sick. (See item #1). ;)

xoxo,
Josh
