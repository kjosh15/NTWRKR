This week is pretty up-in-the-air also - as I expect many of the coming
weeks will be.

I read through your Map and saw so many similarities. but first and
foremost there's a clear and well articulated summary of the challenges
you're now really grappling with. Congratulations; you're doing and taking
responsibility for the work that will affect many people, not least among
them yourself!!! As ever, you continue to inspire. :)

We don't know what's happening near here, but let's set a time as this week
unfolds to reconnect. Until then, sending you all lots of love and
gratitude!
