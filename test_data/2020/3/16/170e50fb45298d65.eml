A) I hope you and yours are safe and healthy!

B) You must be totally underwater. I'll follow up in a couple weeks, so
feel free to punt me.

C) I'm writing as I was recently approached by a major US news channel
about doing regular spots for them. While I'm really flattered, I'll admit
I feel like my brand is much more aligned with the BBC.

I've hosted several documentary series and done plenty of appearances on
television in the past, but it hadn't occurred to me until now that I might
have a bigger role to play.

My focus is on the business implications of technology: my day job is
mostly around consulting to senior executives on technology and innovation
strategy, so I have a pretty good purview of both the business and
technology sides of current issues. For example, in the last week some
headlines and a potential focus I could speak to would be:

1. Engineer At the Center of Waymo/Uber Legal Battle Declares Bankruptcy:
IP is increasingly critical for startups or new tech ventures, but the
current stock structures for early stage companies creates misaligned
incentives.

2. Uber Drivers' Self-Employed Status 'Fictitious', France Rules: GDPR, the
CCPA, China... everyone has a different view on tech. But the differences
around how each country manages these issues is creating friction, with
serious global impact.

3. Iran Cuts the Internet in Response To the Coronavirus Outbreak: top-down
vs bottom-up approaches are getting central stage with the new pandemic,
but the long-term business implications are being overlooked.

Areas I can talk about include:

a. The Future of work
b. Cybersecurity
c. AI/IoT/Genomics/... all "new tech"
d. Where/how business is effected by otherwise obtuse technology changes

I'm curious about being a contributor; either as-needed to comment on the
intersection of technology and business, or as a regular contributor for
weekly online video content. Is this something that's worth pursuing with
anyone on your end? Any advice is appreciated!

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
