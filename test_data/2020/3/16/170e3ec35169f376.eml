Amazing!!! Yes please, add me to the list - I'm excited to hear more about
your adventures.

NYC just got put on lockdown, so things are a little up in the air at the
moment. Where in Ireland *are* you?

all best,

<div>I had a dream about you last night in which I saw you as I remembered =
you over the years, from a little kid when we went to camp through to your =
last visit in NYC. Through it all, in every instance, I was awestruck by yo=
ur kindness, your warmth, your generosity

y day.
<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>So I figured I&#39;d write and tell you. We don&#39;t talk much these =

better just by being you.
