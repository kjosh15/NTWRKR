Hello from this side of the coronapocalypse. Wanted to touch base to try to
keep things moving; despite the tragedy of so many people being sick (or
worse) we're hearing some pretty startling revelations around how poorly
companies are prepared to manage their workforce remotely.

If Big Spaceship is interested, we'd love to see about doing some quick
up-front work together to position Big Spaceship as the perfect consultancy
to use IndigoMetrics as the ideal tool for managing remote workers. If you
were looking to launch your consulting service, this might be the best
possible time to do it.

Let me know if you're game for a short call,
Josh
