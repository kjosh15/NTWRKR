Passing this on for a freind whose wife is working in pediatric care units
in a NYC hospital and being told to use a bandana when delivering babies.
If you're already getting these kinds of requests, my apologies. If you can
help, please do. Most of all, be safe, be healthy, and I hope to connect
again when we're all on the other side of this!

All best,
Josh

As has now been widely reported, our nation's frontline healthcare workers
are facing critical shortages in PPE, personal protective equipment. The
situation is rapidly becoming akin to the workers at Chernobyl who were
forced to clean out extremely radioactive debris with virtually no
protection. Our frontline healthcare workers falling ill and dying is not
only a moral abomination, it could cause an exponential increase in patient
deaths as care becomes heavily rationed. 3D printing may provide a critical
resource to overcome the ever widening gap between what's needed and what's
available, saving thousands of lives.

Would any of your contacts in the 3D manufacturing space be willing/able to
build PPE?

Most in need right now are medical
<https://www.3dnatives.com/en/prusa-medical-shields-covid-19-200320205/>
shields <https://youtu.be/pP7z3iw76GA> and N95 masks
<https://copper3d.com/hackthepandemic/>.

If so, please contact me to organize a call immediately to discuss the
situation in full and what's possible and what's not.

Thank you!
David
