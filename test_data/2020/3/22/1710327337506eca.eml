These are interesting times... I hope you and yours are all doing well and
staying safe and healthy!

Seperately, if you know anyone outside of the city with a place that needs
looking after we're increasingly desperate to get out of here; the pandemic
isn't due to peak for another 40 days and the hospital ICU's are already
80% full. Staying safe and uninfected is a critical priority. Any ideas or
suggestions are welcome!!

All that, and... looking forward to celebrating when this is all over. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
