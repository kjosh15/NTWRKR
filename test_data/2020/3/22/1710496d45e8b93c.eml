That=E2=80=99s amazing, thank you so so much!!! I think our best answer is =
it
depends. Rent would be really hard as we=E2=80=99ll be paying for our curre=
nt
place, but maybe we could work something out, or a payment plan or
something. Distance probably depends on what the local health care and food
supply options look like.

Thank you guys so so so much - there aren=E2=80=99t words!!!

All best wishes,
Josh & Hulda
