Just sent you an invite for tomorrow at 10am EST - hope to talk to you
then!

In the meantime, does the guy who has the place you rent out on Long Island
have any open properties? With the city an epicenter of the coronavirus we
are desperately trying to find someplace to flee to. Any advice / thoughts
/ etc. are appreciated!!

All best wishes,
Josh
