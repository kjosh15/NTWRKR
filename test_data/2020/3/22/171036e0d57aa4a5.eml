These are indeed interesting times... I hope you guys are all doing well
and staying safe and healthy!

Seperately, if you know anyone outside of the city with a place that needs
looking after we're increasingly desperate to get out of here; the pandemic
isn't due to peak for another 40 days and the ICU's are already 80% full.
Staying safe and uninfected is a critical priority for the sake of our
kids. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!!

All that, and... looking forward to celebrating when this is all over. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
