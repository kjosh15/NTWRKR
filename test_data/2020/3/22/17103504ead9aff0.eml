Howdy from the center of one of the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in the USA!
We're all doing well, if wondering how exactly we're going to get through
another few months of shelter-in-place.

One of the biggest problems I've seen is that lots of the "news" about the
virus is really political, with political agendas on a life-and-death
problem. That's crap, and we can do better. Based on the work I've done
online I know you're getting different news than I am, so I figured I'd
share a little of what I'm seeing so we can compare notes, and maybe you
can balance what's in front of you with what's in front of me.

So far the best sourced and visualized data I can find anywhere is here:

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

I've spent most of the last week on calls with senior executives who are
able to buy the best advice available. This reflects what they're hearing
pretty well.

I hope this is helpful and you and yours are all safe and healthy. Be well
and let me know how/if I can help!

your cousin,
Josh
