Hey Josh!
First words of wisdom - we will all get through this. The whole situation
is weird and freaky, and will have ups and downs but it is ultimately - a
moment (a long moment) in time.

Now - for your REAL question -  Without having an equal amount of
information about both countries this is how I would think through a
decision:   In terms of physical safety (i.e. not getting the virus, or at
least delaying getting it so IF you do need medical care it is when the
health care system is not overrun)  I would say answer the question based
on where you think you can best maintain physical separation from people
without going nuts and getting the household stuff you need on a regular
basis.  My personal short term timeline on that is mid-summer (for this
wave).  Separate from that, if your family has any underlying medical
conditions - I'd want to be where the quality and robustness of medical
care is best--regardless of the extremes that might be seen in an emergency
room/ICU.  With that in mind, i'd use my insight to think through the
medical quality and culture of decision-making under stress in Iceland vs.
America.

As for your question about "wait this out there" - to me that means both
the wave happening now (short term) AND the one coming in the fall/winter
which is expected to be far more hellish than what is currently occurring.
I think "wait this out" means 18 months. In that scenario - I'd want to
know where the US stands on getting enough testing kits and testing
infrastructure in place by the Fall and where the first vaccines will be
available.  If you go to Iceland - I would personally go with the mindset
of being there for at least a year.  That said, you are comparing NYC to
Iceland.  You don't have to live in NYC.  A house/apartment in a
low-population density state with a major hospital nearby might meet the
conditions you are thinking you might get in Iceland.

There are so many variables downstream of the whole situation that we can't
"game" out. Don't let those over-complicate how you think through this.
You can control your physical world right now - where can you create the
best physical conditions to avoid/delay getting sick?  Personally, once I
check the box on that one, the anxiety and "gaming" goes WAY down.  One
orthogonal benefit is that it will keep your mental space positive to think
through the GAZILLION fascinating business opportunities around "culture"
that will likely be ripe for business development as a result of all this.
And that too may help drive your long term decision about where you want to
be.   Hope that helps a bit.  Happy to chat more.

Best,
Rachel
