Could really, really use your advice right now. My family has Icelandic
citizenship, and flights to Iceland might close down shortly.

Do we flee and wait this out there?

In Iceland we wouldn=E2=80=99t be eligible for health care, although they w=
ouldn=E2=80=99t
turn us away, and their medical system as a whole is very small. They=E2=80=
=99re
about two weeks behind us in the progression of the disease, but have
already implemented social distancing measures (and are about to step that
up tomorrow) and aggressive testing (although now they=E2=80=99re running o=
ut of
testing materials.) Long term, most of their economy is based on tourism,
and they import most of their food ... so there=E2=80=99s that.

In NYC they=E2=80=99re ahead of the curve, have a robust and diverse econom=
y, and
are doing more testing per capita than S Korea... but they=E2=80=99re only =
just now
putting shelter-in-place into effect and the hospital=E2=80=99s ICUs are al=
ready
80% full.

It=E2=80=99s going to be a disaster either way, but we have no purview into=
 when
travel might open back up or where is likely to be safer short- or
long-term, and safety for our family is our top priority.

Do you have any words of wisdom? I=E2=80=99m sure you=E2=80=99re crazy slam=
med right now,
but I need some clear thinking of the geopolitical variety and you=E2=80=99=
re one
of the best minds I know in this space. Any help is appreciated.

Gratefully,
Josh
