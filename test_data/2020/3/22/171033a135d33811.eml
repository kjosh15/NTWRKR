Will do.  Not a lot of medical back up out there, just s small hospital in
Riverhead.  Also, the full time population out there not exactly healthy,
lots of older people, retirement communities, etc.  (Four people just died
in Greenport, in an assisted living home.)

We'll talk more tomorrow, but I think this thing is wildly overhyped.  You
guys, and children, are nowhere near high risk.  Only 4 percent of those
infected require hospitalization.  I wouldn't worry too much about ICU's.

Will send intro tmw.  He doesn't work Sunday and Monday.

Talk soon, looking forward, R
