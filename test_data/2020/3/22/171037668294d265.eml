These are interesting times - I hope you guys are all doing well and
staying safe and healthy!

I'm sure you've gotten requests like this already, BUT - we're looking for
anyone outside of the city with a place that needs looking after. We're
increasingly desperate to get out of here; the pandemic isn't due to peak
for another 40 days and the ICU's are already 80% full. Staying safe and
uninfected is a critical priority for the sake of our kids. Any ideas or
suggestions are welcome!!

All that, and... looking forward to celebrating when this is all over. :)

XOXO to you and yours,
Josh
