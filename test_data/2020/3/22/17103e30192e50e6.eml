Brandi,

We know you guys went to your mom=E2=80=99s place to weather the storm. We=
=E2=80=99re still
in queens, but are realizing that not having a car is getting to be a real
liability. Is there any chance we could borrow it just so we can take the
kids to the park, etc? I know it=E2=80=99s a huge ask, but these are desper=
ate
times.

I hope you all are safe and healthy,
Josh
