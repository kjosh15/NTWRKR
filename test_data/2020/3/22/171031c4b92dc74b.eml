Tomorrow at 10 your time good, will send confirm.

Think the answer is yes for rental, maybe not all summer.  If not the guy
is a broker and knows everything available in the area.  Think he opens the
place up late April/early May but it's pretty cold out there until June,
even July.  (My house is rented for June, otherwise it would be available.)

Want me to introduce you guys in an email?
