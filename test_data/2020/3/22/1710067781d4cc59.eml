As has now been widely reported, our nation's frontline healthcare workers
are facing critical shortages in PPE, personal protective equipment. The
situation is rapidly becoming akin to the workers at Chernobyl who were
forced to clean out extremely radioactive debris with virtually no
protection. Our frontline healthcare workers falling ill and dying is not
only a moral abomination, it could cause an exponential increase in patient
deaths as care becomes heavily rationed. 3D printing may provide a critical
resource to overcome the ever widening gap between what's needed and what's
available, saving thousands of lives.

Josh, would any of your contacts in the 3D manufacturing space be
willing/able to build PPE?

Most in need right now are medical
<https://www.3dnatives.com/en/prusa-medical-shields-covid-19-200320205/>
shields <https://youtu.be/pP7z3iw76GA> and N95 masks
<https://copper3d.com/hackthepandemic/>.

If so, I think we should organize a call immediately to discuss the
situation in full and what's possible and what's not.

Thank you!

Hugs,

David
