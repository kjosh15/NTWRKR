These are interesting times... I hope you guys are all doing well and
staying safe and healthy!

I'm writing in case you know of anyone outside of the city with a place
that needs looking after. We're increasingly desperate to get out of here;
the pandemic isn't due to peak for another 40 days and the ICU's are
already 80% full. Staying safe and uninfected is a critical priority for
the sake of our kids. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!!

All that, and... looking forward to celebrating when this is all over. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
