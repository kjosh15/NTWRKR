These are interesting times... I hope you guys are all doing well and
staying safe and healthy!

I'm writing to reimphasize that we're really eager to find someone outside
of the city with a place that needs looking after. We're increasingly
desperate to get out of here; the pandemic isn't due to peak for another 40
days and the ICU's are already 80% full. Staying safe and uninfected is a
critical priority for the sake of our kids. Any ideas or suggestions are
welcome!!

All that, and... looking forward to celebrating when this is all over. :)

All best wishes,
Josh
