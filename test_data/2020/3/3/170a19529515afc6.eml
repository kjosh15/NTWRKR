Joshua,

The patient is from Pendleton (+/- 50 miles from here) and works in an India=
n Casino there (which is now temporarily shut down). He was at a basketball g=
ame in a small town in Oregon between here and Pendleton and they brought hi=
m to WW because we have one of the better medical facilities in the area. FY=
I, the hospital is allowing only staff and patients in - no visitors or othe=
rs.=20

We are washing hands, stocked up on food, meds, etc. we are still removed fr=
om the vast majority of the =E2=80=9Ccity folks=E2=80=9D insofar as daily ac=
tivity is concerned, so exposure is FAR lower than riding subways, entering b=
uildings where 1,000s of people work, et cetera.=20

You guys take (extreme) care.=20

Love,
DAD
