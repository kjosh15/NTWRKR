Thanks so much for the intro, Michelle! (To bcc.)

Lisa, I wanted to add that I'm also curious about providing digital
content; there's so much going on in the tech space and so little cogent,
concise content about how it will functionally impact business. Seems like
there may be a gap there for regular content on this topic, especially
given that I have experience in TV (I've hosted three documentary series
and have done several news commentary spots). Let me know if a short call
would be useful!

All best,
Josh
