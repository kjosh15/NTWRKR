Josh,
Great to speak yesterday. I wanted to provide feedback on your question
from slide 11 in the "Pilot Goals" section.

Where we state reducing inventory from 6 months supply down to 2 months -
This goal is stated in the context of the initial findings - So the goal in
a sense is truly to reduce on hand inventory counts. It was however found
that one store carried up to a 6 month supply of product. The
interpretation was that this was due to several criteria and not a single
managed event. It is not current practice to hold that level of inventory
but the lack of visibility to the supply and inventory on hand created the
opportunity in which that occurred.   Make sense?  It might be stated oddly
in the deck because this is one of the points we did not want to circumvent
the internal communication path on since the data is fairly recent.

I am happy to adjust the slide and recut the pdf if you think it needs to
be clarified and if their is potential that you will share the deck. let me
know.

Frederick
