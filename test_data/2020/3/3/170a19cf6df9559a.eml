This is excellent work! I think we can position this as a "platform
overview for discussion" about what elements need
alteration/documentation/etc. The only pieces that i took immediate
exception to were:

"No data passes out of the virtual machine and access is only required by
users to access their
data and by IndigoMetrics to upload new versions and manage static data.

No personal data passes out of the Front End Module"

B/c 1) accessing our web front end pulls data from the VM in order to
populate questions/results/etc., and 2) any information, in sufficient
quantity and diversity, is personally identifying.

Also, the images in the doc are positions super weird and look like ass. Do
you have a gdoc you can share? So we can jointly edit?
