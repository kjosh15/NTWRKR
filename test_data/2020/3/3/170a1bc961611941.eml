Good meeting with Blackrock - they immediately saw utility in
microtargeting, albeit likely outside of real estate as their volume is too
low. They thought brokers might be a better target, but want a couple
paragraphs summarizing the opportunity to facilitate introductions to both
their real estate research team and their marketing team (to see about
application more generally).

So: not a no, but definitely a need to target better inside the org., and a
hint that we may want to look at brokerages. Anyone have a good inside
contact?
