YOU are the technical view :-) I told them about you in last week's

What you wrote is exactly where I'm hoping they'll land. You get it! And if
you know 1-2 people you think have complementary expertise or skills to you
in building this new world, let me know as I can submit them for
consideration before EOD tomorrow.
