Hello Ella Baker Families,

We hope you are bearing up OK.  We understand you are inundated with inform=
ation and that you are juggling many things.  This letter will update you o=
n digital training and a few other details.   Thank you in advance for your=
 patience as we work through this transition.  As you know, the official st=
art date for online learning is Monday, March 23.
Over the last few days, The staff at Ella Baker has been on overdrive.  The=
y have been working non stop developing meaninging work for every student. =
 Since this is new for everyone, there are bound to be bumps along the way.=
  Please be patient.
We have learned that for distance learning to be most successful, families =
should:
Establish a schedule for the day.  This schedule should include the teacher=
=E2=80=99s schedule, your child=E2=80=99s schedule and your schedule as wel=
l.  Over the next few days, begin creating a family schedule.  Find out wha=
t works best and keep tweaking it.  We will be calling in next week to chec=
k on you.
Create areas where students will do work with minimal distractions.
You will need other materials such as paper, pencils, art supplies=E2=80=A6=
.  Start collecting what you can and let us know what else you need.
Play around with the tech platforms that we mention below.
Take care of yourselves.  Be healthy, be patient and remember you.
Computers - Today about 50 families came in to pick up laptops.  Thank you =
for doing this!  We delivered several, and will continue to deliver tomorro=
w and for as long as we can.   If you think there is any confusion about yo=
ur need for a computer/wifi/delivery, please email Betsy at betsy.schneck@g=
mail.com.  Also, we could use one or two volunteer drivers to make deliveri=
es if you are available.  Again, please email Betsy.

If you still need a device, use this attached site to secure one from the D=
epartment of Education.

Zoom - The teachers have all been trained in using the Zoom platform for re=
mote live meetings (and also video production).  Your children may already =
be using Zoom.  Next week, every class will get it up and running.  We envi=
sion using Zoom mainly for small group meetings, and these will be schedule=
d by teachers.   Please be sure to download the app from zoom.us onto a lap=
top (as well as a phone, if you like) and create an account for your child.

Google Classroom - Middle school students are already acquainted with Googl=
e classroom and teachers will continue to use it.  Teachers in other grades=
 will also be using it to post assignments, receive work, etc.  Attached ar=
e some basic instructions.  You will receive more information from classroo=
m teachers soon.  We aim to have all classrooms (grades 1-8)  platform by t=
he end of next week.

Website -  We are busy working on our website so that it can be a convenien=
t portal to teachers=E2=80=99 classroom sites, Google classroom assignments=
, and other resources.  Stay tuned for the unveiling!

We will leave it there for now.  Rest well.

Honored,

Betsy and Josh
