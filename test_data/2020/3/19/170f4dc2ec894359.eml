Joshua,
  Currently we have the booster aimed at an antenna 3.7 miles away but with a=
 mountain ridge between us. It seems to only have 2G. There is another signa=
l - from a tower about 8 miles away (also with a ridge between us) that seem=
s to have 3G. I am going to try to re-aim the antenna to see if we can impro=
ve reception.=20
  We haven=E2=80=99t called because your mother is napping after wanting to g=
et up at 6AM to get to the supermarket early for the Senior Shopping window (=
7 to 9 AM).=20

Love,
a DAD
