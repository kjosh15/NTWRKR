First off, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy!

Sandra mentioned you had been an amazing resource as she figured out next
steps with the current, aggressive owner who has been pushing people out.

We found that our rental history originally showed a switch from rent
stabilized to not in 2011 with no explanation - in the last six months
that's been re-filed as "EXEMPT HIGH RENT VACANCY" in 2011 and thereafter
each year is listed as "EXEMPT APARTMENT - REG NOT REQUIRED."

Based on what we saw w/ Sandra and Noah's apartment - where the switch was
listed while they lived there - we're certain this is illegitimate. We've
just signed a lease renewal through September 30th; what are our options in
pushing them to re-stabilize the apartment? Is this something you could
help with?

All best wishes,
Josh
