We're Icelandic passport holders residing in NYC; what is Iceland's
recommendation on when/if we should return to Iceland in the face of the
growing Covid-19 pandemic? If we do, what's our status on arrival, and
would we be eligible for medical care?

We can quarantine ourselves when we arrive, but we're not clear on what
signs to watch for, what should make us decide to book tickets, or what
would happen when we arrived. Any help and/or advice is appreciated!

Many thanks,
Joshua Klein
