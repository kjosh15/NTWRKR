Hi Josh,

As many things are hitting your inbox, I wanted to send a quick reminder
about tomorrow's Engage Call with Ben Verwaayen, former CEO of both
Alcatel-Lucent and BT Group. He joins members for a virtual discussion
about COVID-19 and its impact in the boardroom. Bringing his robust
experience in leading through crisis to share his thoughts on long-term
scenario planning during trying times. Feedback on the calls we've held
this week has been phenomenal, so I didn't want you to miss this
opportunity. Call details can be found below.

*We will also be sending a calendar invitation, just so you have the
information on hand as your schedule adjusts throughout the day.*

As always, engage calls are optional and feel free to invite your team or a
colleagues.

If you would like to submit a question in advance, you can directly to
questions@w50.com.

Thanks!
Mike
