This is amazing!!! Let me know if they need a more technical view. Aside
from the health and mortality implications this is also an amazing
opportunity for people to be supported in learning new skills that can help
them transition to different kinds of work after the crisis. Savvy
employers will not only enable telework, distance learning, social
networking, and upskilling opportunities - they'll create new ones
leveraging everything we've learned so far. The ones that do will find
themselves with strong allegiances from a swelling population of newly
available workers. It's a hell of an opportunity!

Let me know if I can add more - this is super important work right now!!

All best,
Josh
