*Campaign*
Tovo Labs is proposing to bring together the most sophisticated tech tools
in the world to fight COVID-19 in a key battleground where currently the
war is being lost: the digital/social realm. Misinformation from
well-meaning but poorly informed sources is going viral continually and
disinformation, dedicated attempts to mislead the populace with fatal
outcomes, is also rife. By leveraging the strategic smarts and tech
sophistication that normally goes into winning political campaigns, we can
fight back and potentially win the war against the malicious lies making
the crisis worse, killing people around the world.

For this campaign to have maximal impact and legitimacy in the eyes of
donors and other key stakeholders, we need a public health expert whose
expertise we can leverage to best prioritize target populations,
information disseminated, and provide ongoing consultation on latest
developments. Ideally, this person could also bring to the table their
organization's name, as public issue campaigns are often most successful
when connected to respected, legacy institutions.

*Background*
David has led Tovo Labs <https://tovolabs.com/> to operate directly on the
vanguard of the latest and greatest with digital/data, with a relentless
focus on real-world outcomes (votes, donations, volunteers). He's taken it
so far that he's launched groundbreaking studies
<https://medium.com/@david.goldstein_4168/https-medium-com-tovolabs-proof-of-digital-persuasion-in-alabama-senate-race-85a517481371>
in
places like Alabama, that were featured on a NPR's Planet Money podcast
episode
<https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/726536757/episode-915-how-to-meddle-in-an-election>,
and worked closely with the NYT to reveal how badly Democrats
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/us/elections/trump-campaign-ads-democrats.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage>
are
doing in the innovation game compared to Team Trump. A key thought leader
in this space, Recode/Vox recently interviewed him
<https://art19.com/shows/reset/episodes/6c467937-cf1f-4629-96fa-3d86597b3455>
at
length to discuss the ins-and-outs of the art and science of
microtargeting, and outlets have drawn on his expertise to critique the
tech giants' moves on disinformation, including in the NYT
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/google-ads-disinformation.html>
 and Bloomberg TV
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erti-jNrxsI&feature=youtu.be&t=2141>. As
another example of his achieving real wins for clients, he pulled together
a best-in-class FB advertising GUI and matched with P2P texting platform to
help drive record-breaking turnout
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K-ZYYTqWWch05TltVuuUHkkkkZenuDQw>for
Greta Thunberg at the recent Global Climate Strike in NYC.
