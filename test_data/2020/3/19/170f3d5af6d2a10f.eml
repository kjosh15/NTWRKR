Wonderful. After all these years I'd be so stoked to be able to collaborate
with you again!!

One person I'd suggest is Nikole Yinger. She's deeeeeeep into corporate
transformation and the L&D space and has an extremely enlightened view of
how companies can/should support employees. Like yourself, she's somebody I
always find myself running fast to keep up with and I think she'd be really
helpful. Want an intro? If so, what can I tell her by way of introduction
to both you and the project?
