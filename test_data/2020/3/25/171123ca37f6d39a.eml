Hello,

First and foremost, I hope everyone is healthy and well during these crazy
times.

As you know, the Federal and NYS deadline has been pushed back to July
15th.  With that being said, my husband has contracted the virus and we
have quarantined ourselves from family, friends, babysitters in efforts to
stop the spread of this disease.

Although all of you are very important to me, my family comes first and I
have dedicated my time over the last few days and in the upcoming 2 weeks
to getting everyone healthy.  I will be answering emails but tax
preparation will be limited during this time.  Once everyone is healthy, I
will be back to work and getting everything done as fast as possible. Trust
me, I don't want to be doing taxes in the summer.

I appreciate your patience and if you have any questions, please let me
know.
