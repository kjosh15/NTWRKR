Excellent. You ok if I send this over to Bechtel now? In answer to your
questions:

1. Do you know of an intrusion monitoring software that we could use?

First read this:

https://www.addictivetips.com/net-admin/intrusion-detection-tools/

I'm friends with the team that created Snort, but would suggest OSSIC or
Samhain might be a better fit for our needs. Again, it'll depend on if we
want to protect our VM, our network, or our application.

2. How do we protect our python code. Password, create executable?

Protect it from what? Detection? Analysis? Capture? Please explain the
protection request, and in the meantime check out Cython and this article:

https://www.stop-source-code-theft.com/protecting-python-source-code/

I.e., I think that given the simplicity of what we've built/building we can
probably circumvent a lot of these issues by having more periodic updates.
Also see:

https://snyk.io/blog/python-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet/

This is a little old (and is written to sell a product) but ought to help
on this front.

3. Is there any point having a VM at Liquid, if we are going VM in the UK
(and nobody is asking us for one) wouldn=E2=80=99t it make more sense to us=
e a
large provider? That would give us better business continuity and
auditability for no more cost =E2=80=93 but a bit of hassle / dev cost?

True. Question is if it's a dev cost we want to sustain right now. I'd
suggest to liquid that whatever they set up should be deployed in as
analogous a way as possible for EC2 or equivalent cloud providers and we
then write all our docs with that in mind.

Put another way, if we're successful in leveraging COVID-19 to generate
significant new sources of business then we're going to need a
cookie-cutter means of deploying new instances. VM's are excellent ways to
do this as you simply spin up a new one for each new client, and count on
the cloud provider to secure key elements of each one. That way you only
pay for what you use, and each instance can be managed individually or en
masse (there are infrastructure and control costs to this, obviously.)

4. Which US cloud provider should we use for our Bechtel VM? We need SOC2
and 2 factor auth for our VM access =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.

All the big ones are going to be roughly equivalent; they can all enable 2
factor auth. SOC 2 is going to be primarily on us.

5. What are Bechtel talking about when they talk about an =E2=80=9Cencrypti=
on key
management process=E2=80=9D. This is only if we have the data encrypted at =
rest?

Worth thinking about centralizing our key management:

https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-benefits-of-an-automated-=
and-centralized-key-management-system

and

https://securityboulevard.com/2019/05/what-is-encryption-key-management-and=
-what-factors-should-be-considered-when-implementing-a-kms-solution-2/

I.e., it depends on how we want to structure our system for remote access,
key use, encryption, etc.
