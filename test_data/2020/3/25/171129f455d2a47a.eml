My guess in the US is that is more like 95%+. Possibly elsewhere.

Iceland says 50% of diagnosed (i.e. tested positive) people have no
symptoms.

I thought I heard that somewhere else (Korea?) said 90% asymptomatic!

If that's true, then most places have probably only identified < 1%!.

Yes, I think some things will not change back to how they were!
