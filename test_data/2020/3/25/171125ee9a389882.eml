1. Big Spaceship. I'm mostly just concerned with them getting us into and
through sales. Making training content can happen later, as I think the
immediate benefit to companies is insight into who/where there are
collaboration issues. (See below).

2. Lane 4. I think maintaining and growing culture is a fine pitch given
that everyone is remote - i.e., the immediate threat is that your culture
is going to go sideways because you have no visibility. Indigo gives you
that visibility (plus a lot more) and ability to control, with the option
to scale that control algorithmically over time. Given the crisis I really
think that *just* visibility alone is going to be enough to get people
signed on.

Which pushes for how we distinguish ourselves from competitors. I.e., why
us instead of Glint or anyone else? We really need an apples-to-apples
feature list comparison that shows how critical Indigo is to the remote
work challenge specifically.

Thoughts?
