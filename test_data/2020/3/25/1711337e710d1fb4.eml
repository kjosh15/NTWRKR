Sorry to hear about the layoffs - that's hard in any circumstances. Glad to
hear you're in a good spot, however - I can think of better places than a
horse farm in AZ!!

And very good point about catastrophies proving faith in humanity. We're
seeing some of that now, especially as I start tapping my technology
contacts. Anybody with a 3D printer is pushing out masks at their peak
capacity, for example!!

Shero looks particularly interesting - I can think of four or five
potential investors off the top of my head, especially here in NYC where
COVID-19 solutions can essentially roll out now and get certification
later. How quickly can they scale, and what sort of resources can they
deploy immediately? Unlike many startups, it's a great time for this one to
get investment!

- J
