We're basically in a cement prison. :) The situation changes day by day,
but practically it means staying indoors as much as possible, walking on
the opposite side of the sidewalk from anyone else, washing your hands
after you touch anything outside your home, and wearing a mask to avoid
touching your face. In terms of safety, I think we're going to see the
medical system collapse in the next week/s, so it's a good time not to get
injured or sick (for the next few months).

I've been able to scenario plan for the next few months (see above), but
haven't yet figured out what this all means for the rest of the
country/world as this rolls out. Essentially folks will have to do the same
thing, except with less resources - countryside hospitals are going to get
absolutely smashed by flare-ups as it spreads.

The silver lining to being in NYC is that we have a pretty good chance of
having already had it and being asymptomatic - based on the CDC data 30-80%
of any given population never presents symptoms. This means that when
antibody tests finally role out we may get a gold star and permission to
resume as normal a life as is possible.

Either way my family is going to have to resolve some longstanding
tensions. My wife has always loved NYC for its energy and community,
whereas I've always wanted to be somewhere like where you are now - albeit
with access to relatively frequent travel. If we have to pick one or the
other for the next 18 months... It's an interesting consideration.

I'd be really curious to get your take on where we're at now and where you
see us being at 6, 12, and 18 months. What changes do you think we're going
to see?

Really really glad you're healthy and safe - stay that way, and be well!

All best,
Josh
