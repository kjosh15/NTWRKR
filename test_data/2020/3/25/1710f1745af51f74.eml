These are amazing, thank you Pat!!! Unfortunately they=E2=80=99re both book=
ed up
through May... I think we may be looking further afield (Vermont is lovely
this time of year!) But for that we need a car. Know anyone in the
neighborhood who fled and left one behind we could do a cheap lease on??

This world is crazy.

You guys getting on ok up there? How=E2=80=99s your health?
