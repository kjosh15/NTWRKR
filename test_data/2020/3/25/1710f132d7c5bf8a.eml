Kids seem to be both noncarriers and asymptomatic, so there may be schools
running sooner than you think. The big question is what they look like now
that we=E2=80=99ve seen how much better kids do with a hybrid of focused 1-=
on-1
(from an available parent) and remote sourcing (of content and materials).

I=E2=80=99d be unsurprised if the rich move to a hybrid model of physical s=
chool
part of the day / week and digital school the rest. It=E2=80=99s certainly
something I=E2=80=99m thinking about!! (Then again, my wife is doing most o=
f the
care... who is keeping your kids on task?)
