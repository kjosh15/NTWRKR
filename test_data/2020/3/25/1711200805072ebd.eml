Apologies, Matan. Pretty underwater right now.

I've looked at a few banner plugins but am having a hard time finding a
good / quick answer. Will keep at it.

I wish I could help with thinkific but I don't think I'd be able to
deliver. My apologies.

More as quickly as I can - stay safe and healthy out there!

- J
