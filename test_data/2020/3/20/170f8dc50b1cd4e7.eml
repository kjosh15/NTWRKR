Looking forward to our call Monday - I've pushed to do a podcast for W50
(which would go out to 1800 senior level execs) about the future of work.
Will be following on the heels of Kieth Ferrazi, so need to get a more
tech-centric view, but it's also an opportunity to personally invite any
one of them to collaborate. The messaging in this thread has to underpin
all this.

I've been sitting in on daily calls w/ W50 members led by world experts in
biologicals, financia, leadership, etc. and they're all saying the same
thing: culture is paramount.

It's time to make Indigo BIG.
