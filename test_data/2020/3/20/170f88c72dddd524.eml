Ross,

Apologies for the delay in response - our neighborhood has been really
impacted by the virus and we've been focusing on community outreach and
helping our kids adjust. At the moment next March is clear, and I'm always
keen to interact with your customers. Put me on your list and let's keep in
touch in the coming months!!

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
