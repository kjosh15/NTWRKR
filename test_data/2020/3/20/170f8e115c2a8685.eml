Yes, and.

Companies now are facing a watershed moment where they are being redefined.
If you aggressively shift towards metrics that *matter to individuals* you
are able to leapfrog into massively much stronger engagement, alignment of
purpose, and empowered autonomy. In other words, you can level up your
entire organisation overnight by making the challenges of this pandemic a
crucible for their work identity.

More generally, they need to do this because otherwise they will face
churn, loss of efficiency, and ENORMOUS potential for conduct risk/IP
theft/etc. But specific to our pitch, just asking your employees if they
feel happy with their job won't tell you shit. Keeping them engaged in the
growth of their own careers and their relationships with their peers is a
much more powerful strategic move that can enable companies to not only
weather this crisis, but to come out of it ahead of their competition.

Hm. Should we write a medium article about this or something? If so, we
should do it now!!
