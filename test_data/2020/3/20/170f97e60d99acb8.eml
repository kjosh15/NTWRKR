Hey hey. Glad you wrote.

Time is moving strangely the last few days, but I've been wanting to get
back in touch. We went remote last Thursday and it's been fairly smooth,
but there are a thousand decisions to be made trying to keep everything
relatively stable. I'd love to do a call/Zoom next week - how's your
schedule looking?
