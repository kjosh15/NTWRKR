I think you've got the right tone, but the initial abstract needs to be way
more specific. "Most older populations are being misled, deliberately or
through bad viral information. We can get the right information in front of
them and save lives" is much more exact; you then go on to explain how
you're going to do it.

Otherwise looks great!!
