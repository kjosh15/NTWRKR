Chris,

Sat in on a call w/ Ben Verwaayen, former CEO of both Alcatel-Lucent and BT
Group, about how companies need to lead right now. Some very interesting
notes, and maybe the best articulation I've heard yet about why Indigo is
in a prime position. My rough notes are below.

best,
Josh

In any crisis, the most important asset to manage is your people.
Fear is the worst advisor you can think of.
If you have trust you have to demonstrate that you're willing to embrace
the unknown.
Our values are going to bring us to an end game.
Have courage; because our values dictate this particular action, I embrace
action X, Y, or Z.
People in the organization may have a much better idea of what's happening
in the field than the board.
You need to be agile and very fast in execution.
You need trust from the people on the ground, and they have to have trust
in the leadership.
Boards need to know you understand that the way forward is not building a
bridge backwards - it's building one to what's to come
This will change how we define what good looks like. This is an opportunity=
.
If we rebuild a lot of the global rules - as we will have to - a lot of
things which were desirable but unachievable a few months aga will be
possible.
What's in your wish list? It's worth your time to think about this now.

If it's a long crisis, you have to figure out how to manage your people for
the long term.
If you take the view that you'll have to operate under these new conditions
for the next nine months you'll take a more drastic view.
His advice is: take the more drastic view.
The frame of purpose is the next generaton's measurement of success. His
prediction is going to be center stage in new regulations and legislation.
There will be a new rulebook about global trade.

people in society are being asked to do the most amazing things, and to
operate in the most uncertain of conditions.
If we then ask them to come back and reinstate everything as it was
before... isn't realistic.

teleworking:
leaders need to reach out with personal attention.
one of the habits that works extremely well is agile teams.
home working means you're working with different toolsets, not that you
only work one-on-one
the rest of the interaction should stimulate the time to chat and gossip.
I.e., take time for the social complex. It's a very important part of
feeling comfortable.
the more the digital world becomes the personal comfortable world the more
effective you are.

a recession may be inevitable, how do we reduce the negative impact
do a lot of scenario planning
the recession won't be the same as 2008; it'll be very different as it's
global and much more about the people issue
the financial markets are pretty solid, and they react to the people crisis
the answer isn't in the financials it's in the people

There's enormous pressure on senior leaders
so the temptation is to push your staff harder
that may not be a good strategy.
getting smarter IS the right thing to do.
we will see reputations made and broken forever in the way we communicate
people share EVERYTHING now; you're completely in the public domain

innovating demonstrates to the markets that you're not only open for
business, but actually capable of more
dealing with this is terribley difficult for boards
most boards understand this is an unprecedented attack on the creativity of
our management
the board wants to know you have a structure in place to deal with the
challenges in front of you today

Partners are more important now than ever before.
the level of understanding between partners will have to go up.
hierarchy may be the worst model to get the information you need to the
table
you will HAVE TO rely on others
the relationship isn't just with the short term; partnership is a long term
asset
in today's environment asking how to HELP your partners is probably the
best move.

Dare to dream! We live in frameworks, in things we've always done. Now
we're being forced to do them different.
