Absolutely! I'd be curious what Kieth had to say - I'm willing to bet I can
build on that, esp. from the technical side. One thing I've been hearing
from clients is that they have no idea how much data they already have, or
how they can use it to build capacity for managing talent going forward in
this weird new world order. Want to do a quick call reg.?
