Matan,

Apologies for the delay; as you can imagine things are a bit crazy.

Steven sent me some code that could be inserted - I=E2=80=99ll try to take =
a look
at this ASAP but it could be a couple days. I know this is critical to your
business so will do my best. How are you doing otherwise and what are your
plans going forward? Let me know if there are any other initiatives that
may need my help.

Stay safe and healthy,
Josh
