Hi Josh,

Just reaching out to you.  Hope you and family are well and healthy under
these bizarre circumstances.

I was going to come over this past week but decided not to just in case I
got stuck there and might be away from my daughters.  Good thing as both of
their schools closed early and they are home now for an extended stay
(which includes a previously scheduled month long holiday.)

Have posted a couple of things on the site concerning corona, hope you like
them.  We are going to make the social media buttons live soon so all will
be able to forward and share.  Just one more round of new stuff to add.

Also, Joey at Shortlist is being proactive and looking to do an insurance
money raise for a worst case scenario.  I think the business model is a
sound one, especially in an economy where many companies will be reluctant
to hire full timers.  If you know anyone send them my, or Joey's way.

Let me know how you are, happy to have an online catch-up if you have time
and are inclined.  Finally speaking with Weena tomorrow, looking very
forward to it.

Best,

Ron
