Good talking with you too, Ron. It proved to be a powerful reset for me
also as your reframing this around the unique skills we have to bear on
this opportunity was spot on. We need to run towards opportunity, rather
than brood on the challenges we cannot address in the present.

And I love the idea of new growth after a fire. :) Hit me up to chat again
next week or so, and be well in the meantime!

All best, J
