The 8 isnt a problem (it makes the feedback a bit jumpy and its easier to
figure out who gave you what feedback =E2=80=93 but still workable =E2=80=
=93 one of my
friends uses it on his 6 man company and loves it =E2=80=93 even though I h=
ave done
no support for his scheme) =E2=80=93 what would the values / skills we woul=
d be
tracking =E2=80=93 if you could think of those I could easily set up a sche=
me for
us to experiment with. Possibly 4 or 5 generic values =E2=80=93 Respect,
Enthusiasm, Reliability, Courage (to address limitations), Communication?
Then we could have separate action statements for kids and parents =E2=80=
=93 but
based on the same values. Let me know what you think and I=E2=80=99ll set a=
 scheme
up for you to look at.

We're curious if there's anything we could do with the platform for the
cell we've formed. Four parents, four kids. We're looking to write up what
we've learned, and I thought it could be a great platform to show Indigo in
a new light. That said, there are only eight of us! Any ideas?
