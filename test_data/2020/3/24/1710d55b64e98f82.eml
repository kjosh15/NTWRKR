Yoinks! Take good care of yourself... Are you starting to feel better?

We're in the middle of NYC, lady! In all seriousness, we're fine. Kids are
LOVING co-school (we made a cell with a neighbor family), and we're
adapting to seeing all the white people vacate the neighborhood. Wearing a
mask and not touching anything in a super dense urban area is kind of
killing us, but according to the president we'll all be back to work in a
couple weeks so no worries.

The only downside is that I suspended almost all of my business development
efforts to sink time into IDEO Q3/4 last year, and now with the virus all
of my speaking gigs for Q1/2 have vanished, so we're way overleveraged.
Having no capital to invest in escaping the city is scary.

Good news is that I have a great ear on the ground with almost the entire
Fortune 400 as they try to make sense of the crisis. World 50 is hosting at
least a call a day and attendance is in the hundreds, with some of the best
minds in the world hosting talks on all kinds of topics (mostly financial,
business planning, strategy, and bio). It's FASCINATING to see how they're
trying to make sense of things, esp. the balance between EU and US.

And of course the silver lining in all this is that there will be ENORMOUS
opportunity on the back of the crisis. I've been told repeatedly that once
the dust settles people are going to realize they need individuals who can
look around the corner into the future and suggest strategies to take
advantage of the shifting landscape.

How about you - what are you looking forward to off the back of all this?

- J
