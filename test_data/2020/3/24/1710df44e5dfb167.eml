Doing well, although no house on Long Island - I envy you that! (OTOH, a
40% loss sucks for pretty much everybody...)

I'm pretty excited about the opportunity presented by this crisis, but
really impatient for companies to get past the initial hair pulling and
into the planning and strategy. So much we can do here...

Curious what sort of advisory stuff you're seeing - I got a couple startups
that I advise through funding rounds just before the crisis and am curious
to work on some others. Would be fun to work on something together!

Keep me posted and be safe,
Josh
