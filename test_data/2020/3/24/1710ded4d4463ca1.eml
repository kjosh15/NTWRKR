Glad you're with your family! Very curious to see how things play out both
here and there - NYC is frighteningly batshit at the moment. I'm just
hopeful I can get us to Iceland by this summer; chances are good Icelandair
and related airline routes will all be shut down for quite some time. It
definitely makes me curious about living elsewhere...

The Talisker is waiting for me; rather than risk it on the flight back I
decided to celebrate returning to Iceland with it. So, hopefully it'll be
fantastic very soon!!

All best to you and the family,
Josh
