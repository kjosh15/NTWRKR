First off, how are you and yours?? Safe and healthy, I hope!!

Secondly, thank you so, so, so much for your feedback. Your words played
heavily into our thinking and were a massive relief to me personally as I
struggled to find a way to think through some very difficult decisions.

For the time being we've decided to stay. We have far superior resources
here in terms of community (we've made a cell with another family to
support education, childcare, etc.) and supply chains (Iceland is quite
likely to have problems with medical supplies and food), testing in NYC is
ramping up significantly, and economically NYC is more likely to weather
this storm with food on the shelves. Finally, Iceland has made it clear
that it will evacuate any Icelandic citizens if it feels they are in
immediate danger, so if things take a dangerous turn for the worse that
should remain an option.

As none of us have health issues - and based on the numbers I'm seeing it's
quite likely we've already been infected and either recovered or are
asymptomatic - it feels, paradoxically, to be safer here in NYC. I'm very
keen to get us all to an AirBnB in Vermont or something like that (again,
given that we're all relatively healthy and hopefully unlikely to need an
ICU), but costs are an issue - we were overleveraged at the end of last
year, and the majority of my spring/summer income was intended to be from
speaking (which is obviously off the table atm).

It's a scary, crazy time - things are moving very fast. I find myself often
wondering how you're thinking about the situation and how your ability for
swift, rational thought is enabling you to make new estimations. I hope
you're out there having a positive impact on the situation: I've been doing
a lot of work considering strategies for corporations to leverage the
technological shift, but am keen to do something more direct. Please do let
me know if you can think of any way I could contribute, and/or if we can
help you in any way!

Gratefully,
Josh
