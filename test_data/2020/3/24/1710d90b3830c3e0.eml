Hey Josh - wanted to pick your brain. This is an initiative a friend of =
mine is working on at UofW. He is an awesome guy, and he is wickedly =
smart.

I have connected him to the Canadian University Hospitals (UHN) here in =
Canada, and am working on connecting him to Bocconi University in Milan =
where I know the head. Which would also be a helpful collaboration as =
you might imagine.

But I know you have contacts that go well beyond mine. And a brain much =
bigger than mine. Any ideas on how you and your connections might be =
able to help ?

I can send an intro to you and Alex, or to anyone that you think it =
would help to get him plugged into. Could do some awesome work here=E2=80=A6=
.

Thoughts ?

> Hi Bruce,
>=20
> My research teams at the University of Waterloo and DarwinAI have =
launch an AI initiative in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. As the =
first step of this initiative (we have a number of other directions we =
are pursuing in leveraging AI towards this cause), we have developed =
COVID-Net - an open source deep neural network for detecting COVID-19 =
infections from chest radiography, with AI explanations to gain =
transparency into visual indicators of COVID-19.  With the unprecedented =
number of COVID-19 infections on a global scale, chest radiography =
(e.g., chest X-rays) has now become more than a complementary screening =
tool to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR testing (i.e., the swab lab =
test), with it actually being used as a primary screening tool in the =
countries that are most affected due to its speed and availability.
> =20
> Rapid screening is critical as it enables those infected to receive =
immediate care, as well as be isolated to mitigate the spread of the =
virus.  By leveraging deep learning AI with COVID-Net, we aim to help =
clinicians improve both sensitivity and specificity by better =
differentiate COVID-19 infections from other forms of viral infections, =
which is a current challenge faced given their similarities, as well as =
assist clinicians with additional knowledge about how COVID-Net detects =
COVID-19 infections through AI explanations. We are making COVID-Net =
available in an open source, open access manner, the hope is to =
accelerate the global use and development of complementary COVID-19 =
screening solutions for rapid screening of those who need it most.
>=20
> The COVID-Net model, dataset, and scientific paper describing both =
COVID-Net and dataset (5941 posteroanterior chest radiography images =
across 2839 patient cases gathered from public datasets) are available =
on Github for anyone to use and build upon:=20

<https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net>.=20
>=20
> In addition to making the COVID-Net available on Github, we'll also =
make our explainability tool available to researchers and healthcare =
providers so that they can see the critical factors that caused a =
diagnosis using COVID-Net - which would help with adoption in the field.
>=20
> We want to keep improving this initiative so looking for any support =
and contributors who can contribute COVID-19 x-ray images, contribute =
expertise with model improvements, contribute funding to support our =
teams during this difficult time to keep focused on this initiative, =
connect us with the right agencies and institutions for support, etc. =20=
