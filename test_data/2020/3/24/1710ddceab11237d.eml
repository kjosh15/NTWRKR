Word from my contact who can intro us there (Kris) suggests that they'll
want to meet us f2f, so we have time.

On a more positive note, he suggested that they're running 30m "teaching"
sessions on whatever topic you're interested in. It's unpaid, but could be
a good way to build equity with them.

Just a thought!
