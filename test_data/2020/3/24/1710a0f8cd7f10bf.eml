Thanks again for the call and the incredibly generous offer, Aaron=2E I
wanted to follow up to ask if you had any advice on finding anyone in that
area who might have a farm or a relatively removed (and large) place that
we could rent for a couple months=2E

We're currently in a cell with another family to support both sets of kids=
,
and the ideal situation would be a place big enough for all of us to work
from remotely and where the kids could run around=2E

I know I'm pushing my luck here, but you produced miracles the first time
around so I figured I'd see what you thought=2E Again, any suggestions are
welcome!

Very, very gratefully,
Josh
