Wanted to add that I have Icelandic citizenship, so can work anywhere in
Europe. As things unfold here in the US, that may actually be preferred opt=
ion!
:)

Separately, I'm hearing a TON of commentary from senior leaders about how
they need to follow two tracks rightnow: one to secure themselves in this
time of crisis, and one to forecast, design, and deploy plans to capitalize
on their recovery. Strangely, innovation has just gone from a nice-to-have
to a must-have when it comes to strategic planning going forward, with
technology as focus - especially around remote work.

In many ways, this pandemic has done in three months what my last book
(Reputation Economics) predicted would take a decade. What remains to be
seen is which companies take advantage of it!

Let me know what I can add,
Josh
