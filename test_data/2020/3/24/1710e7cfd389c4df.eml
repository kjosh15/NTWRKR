He=E2=80=99s definitely interested - we kicked off the call with my asking =
him
about where his org is at, and he=E2=80=99s very confident about their long=
 term
survivability if unhappy about the short-term costs (JetBlue is one of
their biggest clients). One key quote: =E2=80=9Cthe companies that survive =
this are
the ones that beat manage their cash flow, but that includes building new
revenue streams for the future.=E2=80=9D

Two points:

1. He has been speaking with someone who does enterprise software sales at
a big company about how to work with them. He=E2=80=99s going to talk with =
them
about how/if they could help beyond the brand/messaging piece.

2. He=E2=80=99s going to talk to his executive team about how they could ha=
ndle the
brand/messaging piece for us regardless of (1).

Again, I offered that we white label this through big spaceship and split
the revenue, whatever that looks like (knowing that we could offer it to
W59 for free for three months, or at a discount, or or or). I also
explained that we had two offerings; a canon of values most companies had
modified for remote work (I.e., a standard indigo instance) or a remote
work value set anyone could just drop in. Finally, I reinforced that we=E2=
=80=99re
the only ones in this space that can measure arbitrary values and also
measure peer-to-peer relationships around said values.

Oh, and your discovery about our numbers going up in use by remote workers
was gold. :)

He=E2=80=99s going to talk to his contact tomorrow afternoon and get back t=
o me
ASAP - I made it clear W50 is pushing me for talking points and really want
a podcast from me.

Oh, and simultaneously I=E2=80=99m pushing CNBC to take a video piece from =
me on
this same topic - not immediately, I know ... but it=E2=80=99ll be worth so=
mething
for them soon enough!

Looking forward to more tequila,
Josh
