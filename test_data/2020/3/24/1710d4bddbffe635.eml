Curious what you need! 

Right now we're working with the embassy to see if/when Icelanders need to 
be evacuated - currently NYC is leading on resources and supply chain 
sourcing. It's the hotspot in the US, but based on the numbers that looks 
like it's mostly because of testing ramping up here. If we can get testing 
scaled I think we'll see that other places are already on the other side of 
the hump. The other factor is that chances are very good we're already 
either infected or past being infected (again based on the numbers), 
meaning that our biggest threat is likely financial... for which NYC is 
very much a better bet for survival.

Fuck, I wish I knew for sure what was coming. The fact that all my speaking 
business fell off a cliff means I need to get other employment ASAP, which 
is (unfortunately) driving a lot of our decisions around staying here. 

Really appreciate being able to back and forth with you about all this. 
Coronavirus is here for the duration, but we're already seeing examples out 
of Asia around how we will be able to adapt - and once we can do antibody 
testing we should be able to move things forward even faster. 

Any thoughts are welcome - hope you're well!
- J
