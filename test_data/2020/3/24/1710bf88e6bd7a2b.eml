Well, we live somewhere remote, so not much change for us. Shopping is a
problem because of panic buying and I guess the "don't visit friends" ban
is going to start to be noticeable after a while, but TBH if we see friends
more than once a week that's unusual.

Almost all of our friends around here are also quite isolated - I don't
think we know anyone that lives in a village, let alone a town - so I
suspect even if we did see people occasionally we'd be OK.

Main issue for me is I've been taking drugs for mild hypertension for
years, and I get on with them just fine (like zero side effects). However,
the comorbidity for hypertension is 8%! Thought to be due to ACE
inhibitors, which promote ACE2, which is COVID-19's entryway to the cell.
I'm reluctant to switch drugs (yes, I am on an ACE inhibitor), because side
effects and also not a good moment to be bugging doctors, but I might just
give it up temporarily. In fact, planning to do that starting today. When
my doctor prescribed them she told me if I ever felt like it I could just
stop taking them, so not a huge risk, tho should do something about it in
the long run (like lose some weight!).

Camilla is also perhaps at increased risk, she has a somewhat compromised
immune system - tho recent tests showed improvement. So, probably best to
avoid infection! As a result the plan for one of our sons to join us, for a
while at least, has been put on hold for a while, particularly since he has
a sore throat (no fever, no cough). But we shall see.

How's it working out with you?
