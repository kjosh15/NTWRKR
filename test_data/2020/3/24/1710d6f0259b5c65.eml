So glad to hear you're all doing well!! We're still in NYC; despite the
news reports (which of course focus on only the worst things to share) NYC
is overall doing pretty well. We've created a cell with another family with
two kids that get on very well with ours from the same school, and said
school has done an AMAZING job with the remote education. The kids are
loving it, especially as it's now two moms, four kids, and four (remote)
teachers doing all the support.

It's still early days, obviously, but we made a deliberate decision to stay
here for the sake of the kids - if we went to Iceland it would be a
terrible shift with very little socialization and potentially a bad lack of
resources as the economic shocks start to set in. Iceland's economy was
primarily based on tourism - which just stopped overnight - and they're
likely to have the same medical supply problems as everywhere else when
their numbers ramp up, but without any of the economic clout to address it
such as we see here in NYC.

It's been very difficult, I won't lie. The social distancing, limiting
yourself to parks in the early morning and afternoon (so the kids don't
encounter others), and the constant uncertainty are diminishing. I'm
jealous of your garden! But as you noted, we're privileged in this strange
circumstance.

Expect me to initiate some conversations about living in Europe once things
settle, however. ;)

Give all our very best birthday wishes to Josi for us,
Josh
