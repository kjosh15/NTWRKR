Hey, Josh.

Interesting times, indeed.

I so wish I had some ideas for you! We've been in isolation here in
Southold since a week ago Saturday. I've had some symptoms that could be
Covid-19, but since they were mostly mild, I haven't been tested.

If I hear of anything, I'll definitely reach out. Hope you're all able to
stay safe!

Jocelyn
