Word I'm hearing is that companies need to both plan to manage the current
crisis, and plan for how to innovatively take advantage of opportunity in
recovering from it. I'm very interested in the latter. Let me know if
things are remotely sane enough for a conversation with Andrew Bolwell -
clearly companies have to act now, and I'm keen to have an impact.

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
