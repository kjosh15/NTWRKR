First off, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy. These are crazy
times!!

Secondly, I spoke with Ron today and he encouraged me to contact you to see
what was going on with you. As all events and speeches have been cancelled
indefinitely I'm suddenly with a lot more time available - let me know if
there's anything I can help you with!

Separately, we're almost done preparing a pitch for NextJump... and waiting
a week or two for the right time to approach them. Let me know if you think
that timing is off.

All best wishes,
Josh
