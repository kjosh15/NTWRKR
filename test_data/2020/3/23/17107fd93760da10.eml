We're unfortunately one of the families being hard-hit by the coronavirus;
all of our income has dissapeared basically overnight, and because we were
counting on it to make up for a tough year we're in a really hard place.

This means we won't be able to keep paying for JHELC, which is TERRIBLE
news because you guys have absolutely made a home for both of our boys. We
know you must be struggling to keep all your staff safe and employed in
very uncertain times.

Please know we'll do our best to get payments to you as we're able;
obviously we're scrambling right now to find anything we can. Here's hoping
that they discover that children can gather safely soon, or find a cure, or
put in better testing regimes, or something to allow for normal life to
resume.

Thank you again for everything, and all best wishes to all of you.
Josh Klein
