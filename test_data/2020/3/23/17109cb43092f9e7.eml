Good news is hard to come by these days, but we got some - the first estate
payment ($25k) came in!

This means we now have about $34,460 in cash, with a credit card debt of
$17,600.

Vanguard contacted us to tell us that they don't do Solo 401k's.

I'm guessing our first step should be to pay off the credit card (let me
know if otherwise!) and the second step should be to move our IRAs to
somewhere we can take out a solo 401k. What do you recommend?

Many many thanks - I hope you and yours are safe and healthy in these crazy
times!!

All best,
Josh
