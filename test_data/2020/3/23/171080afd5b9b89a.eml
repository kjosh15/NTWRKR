Let me know if you have time for a brief call this week; anytime that's
good for you. I know you must be busy!!

Separately, any news on the roof? I looked through the window but didn't
see anything had been done. So far no leaks today, fingers crossed!

I hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
