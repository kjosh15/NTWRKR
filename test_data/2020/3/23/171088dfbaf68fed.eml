My dad said that for our family compound, it looks like we got a cousin of
mine in one house and another house reserved for a different cousin and her
family.  The third house (my uncle George's house)....you just really don't
want to get involved with!!!

Also just asked a friend Nina Watkins who has a bungalow in this 7-bungalow
community place right near where we are. I believe 5 bungalows are owned
individually and they rent out the other two. So let's see what she says
too.
