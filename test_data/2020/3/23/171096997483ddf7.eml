I=E2=80=99m writing in the hopes that you and both your families are safe a=
nd
healthy. Right now we=E2=80=99re in the epicenter of the coronavirus in the=
 US and
aren=E2=80=99t feeling much of either; an already nearly collapsed  health =
system
and a quickly growing base of unemployed and scared populace is making NYC
a really bad place to be.

Do either of you know of anyplace near you that could hold a family - or
better two - for a few weeks? We=E2=80=99re more than happy to self quarant=
ine, but
for the sake of our kids are increasingly desperate to get out of the city
as the crisis ramps up.

I know you=E2=80=99re probably hearing a lot of stuff like this - and in an=
y case
are juggling crazy business demands in the face of an increasingly crazy
economic climate. ANY advice is appreciated.

Sincerely and with thanks,
Josh
