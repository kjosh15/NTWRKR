So far: Old Lyme, CT is a =E2=80=9Cno=E2=80=9D though they highly recommend i=
t as a place with good healthcare and trails through the woods.=20

My friend Andrew in Kingston, NY asked his art studio building landlord abou=
t residential availability, which the landlord said he has and offered to pu=
t you in touch with him. He also volunteered that you could stay with him in=
 his small house, but that it probably wasn=E2=80=99t practical #socialclose=
ning

Josh, I=E2=80=99ll send you an email intro to Andrew.=20
