I hope you and yours are safe and healthy; where are you?

Just checking in; we're trying to figure out if/when we should head back to
Iceland. One of the biggest questions is if we could find work when we get
there. Is now a good time to ask for that intro to your Bifrost contact?

I hope you're all doing well - these are crazy times indeed!!!!

All best wishes,
Josh
