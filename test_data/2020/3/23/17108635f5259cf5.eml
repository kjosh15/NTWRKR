It's reasonable commentary given the draconian measures China put (and have
mostly been keeping) in place. What isn't clear is how broadly herd
immunity has or hasn't been developed outside of that. Without knowing that
data he's basically just made a lucky guess.

BUT, if you're in to data (Dad I know you'll love this) check out this site=
:

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

I've been geeking out on the methodologies behind CFR, among other things.
Another great source to really understand what we know (and don't) so far
is the CDC:

https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/

I found this one particularly encouraging in that it explained some of the
weaknesses and therefor the bais' in the data we're seeing so far used to
estimate mortality rates. For example, in Italy there's a very high level
of antibiotic resistance, smoking, and a much much older population. One of
the *really* good pieces of news is that if you don't have existing
comorbidities (like heart disease or diabetes) your risk of dying does way
down. So, all that red wine may pay off! ;)

Anyway, pursuant our conversations about not knowing what we don't know,
this goes a long way towards helping us understand what it is that we don't
know and what that data is likely to indicate. We're still being as
absolutely careful as we can while maintaining the kid's sanity just so we
can help with flattening the curve - the really big question which is top
of my mind but not addressed here is what's going to happen to the economy
when the dust settles.

Lots of love,
Josh
