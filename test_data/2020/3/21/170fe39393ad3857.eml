the second conversation; seems like lots of connections here!<br><br>One of=
 the questions you had was about the type of work I did for IDEO. Obviously=
 I can&#39;t discuss anything not publicly known about IDEO, their business=
, processes, clients, etc. etc. but I&#39;m happy to outline the type of st=
rategy work I&#39;ve done in the past inasmuch as it pertains to the kind o=
f work I could help BigSpaceship with. <br><br>Specifically, this type of s=
trategy work has often involved:<br><br>	- conducting one-on-one interviews=
 with stakeholders across all offices to understand the business prerogativ=
es, assets, and opportunities.<br>	- Conducting expert interviews with exte=
rnal clients, potential clients, area experts, and competitors.<br>	- Synth=
esised these interviews through a strategic framework either native to the =
client (such as IDEO&#39;s Play To Win approach) or external as best fits t=
he needs of the client.<br>	- Expand the strategic recommendation to areas =
of immediate impact<br>	- Draw out those areas to detail processes, key KPI=
s with initial tests for validation, and anticipated outcomes with paired r=
esponse strategies.<br>	- Create a timeline for test execution, evaluation/=
validation, and revision.<br>	- Indexes of all working material for later a=
nalysis and reference, the formal strategy process, example content (if any=
 are related), detailed deliverables descriptions and requirements, and any=
 additional value-add insights otherwise outside of the strategic approach.=
<br><br>Put in human-speak, I dig deeply into the company, detail all the o=
pportunities and problems that pertain to the project goal, use a formal st=
rategic method to force rigor in shaping a recommendation, and then detail =
that recommendation into a series of actionable tests that can be used to v=
alidate progress towards the recommended goal(s). <br><br>That&#39;s one ty=
pe of project I&#39;ve really enjoyed in the past, and have done variations=
 for several organizations. Outside of that, and based on what I know of Bi=
g Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I&#39;ve also done a lot of:<br><br>	- T=
echnology advising. I&#39;ve helped shape the technological approach for li=
terally hundreds of projects, processes, companies, startups, R&amp;D divis=
ions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is not in outlining code str=
uctures or hacking together prototypes, but in articulating the value propo=
sition for the client and identifying strategic opportunities from a divers=
e set of technologies and business elements to create results that are more=
 than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic innovation consulting; this=
 is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39;s clients that underwrote my strategy =
work. <br><br>	- Managing clients and creating partnerships. One of the wei=
rd side effects of being an executive-whisperer is that I&#39;ve got a uniq=
ue perspective on the global market, the ways that emerging technologies ca=
n be harnessed, and where otherwise obtuse partnerships could make great se=
nse. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV interviews, articles, books, r=
adio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a more complete list at <a hr=

ts, an incubator for IMAX, a social good platform for the CMO of Coke, etc.=
<br><br>Finally, I also think I could do well at Business Development. Beca=
use I&#39;ve spent nearly two decades freelancing in NY and globally, and b=
ecause for the last decade that&#39;s been almost exclusively and directly =
to senior executives of major multinationals, I&#39;ve got an excellent and=
 unusual network. While I&#39;ve used this network to secure funding for st=
artups, to cross-sell solutions from same, and to develop project partnersh=
ips, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusively. But I think I could do a pretty goo=
