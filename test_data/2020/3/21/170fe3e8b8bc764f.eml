I have a call with the ceo Tuesday and want to pitch his company handling
messaging/branding around using the platform for shifting employees to
telework. They have the capacity more than we do to message and sales
properly, so have a think about how/where to invite them in - I=E2=80=99m h=
oping to
give a podcast on the topic to W50 members ASAP.

Separately, will be offering the platform for free to W50 (b/c if they like
it we get crazy good intros/branding/etc) and am curious if we can run it
with a super small cell - like 8 people in our Covid co-school (including
kids!!)

Finally, am being pitched as a head of special projects for a major pharma
company based in Boston to build a platform for individuals to
learn/advance on their own interests as a way to keep them aligned /
engaged. It=E2=80=99s not the best option on the table (it=E2=80=99s FT and=
 in Boston) but
if it comes down to it I=E2=80=99ll take it and it could be a way to push i=
ndigo.

More on Monday,
Josh
