Michael,

Apologies for the delay; I'm ten minute's walk from Elmherst hospital, the
epicenter of Covid-19 in the United States, and it's been a big couple
weeks of working to help organize friends and neighbors in the calm before
the storm.

That said, it's also an incredibly exciting time for big companies!! Here's
what I'd like to talk about:

- The Overton Window (for tech): We're currently compressing ten years of
technology adoption into six months. Our opportunity to leapfrog ahead has
never, ever, ever been better.

- Privacy: the knee-jerk reaction of many companies is to buy lots of
spyware to attempt to keep control. But you don't have control, and this
will get you less.

- Security: Workers are more autonomous than ever, and BYOD is suddenly the
norm. There's HUGE security risk here, as ever but the biggest have nothing
to do with the tech.

- All the lego pieces: Robots, IoT, AI, analytics, smartphones... We have
unprecedented technology here now, already - how do we disentangle outmoded
context from immediate opportunity?

- What comes next?: Telework isn't going away. Ordering groceries is
suddenly the norm. Employees are now minding themselves. What other sacred
cows are we going to leave behind?

This is just a rough list - the big picture is that we have the opportunity
to leverage twenty plus years of the most rapid advancements in technology
in human history... or repeat the same mistakes all over again. Let's
discuss how to thread that needle!!

All best,
Josh

P.S. I'm going to listen to Keith Ferazzi's piece this evening and will
revise the above accordingly to make sure we don't cover duplicate material
- I just didn't want to delay further!
