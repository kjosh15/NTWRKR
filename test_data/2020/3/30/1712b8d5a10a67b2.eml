Had a good convo with Michael (the Ceo) and the guy from VIP wordpress. I
suspect this was as much a vetting from the latter for the former than a
potential partnership. In any case he asked a lot of questions but seemed
to think we were in the right spot - and the biggest challenge will be
getting that first large enterprise customer to brag about.

Michael wanted to get me to walk the VIP WordPress guy and some of his own
staff through the platform as a next step, but I think we need to present
him with an ask to get this thing moving. Something like:

- new website
- new pitch deck
- any sales collateral (case studies, white paper, overview deck,
implementation walkthrough, etc.)
- whatever marketing material they think is most pertinent, such as short
video, feature diagrams, comparison charts, etc.
- help articulating the core talking points and differentiation messaging
for use in podcasts (w50), TV (CNBC), and text (medium, HBR, Fast Company,
etc.), and talks (SXSW, Singularity.)

In exchange we can push all potential sales from those channels through
them as a true white-labeled solution (I.e., partner with them and the
client to upskill them in the onboarding process and ongoing consulting
work, then back into the role of platform service provider.)

Does that work? What am I missing?
