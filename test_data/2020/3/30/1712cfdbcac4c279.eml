Thanks again for the call last week - it was really useful to get another
perspective on growth!

We're keen to move quickly, but wanted to make sure we were crystal clear
on what both partners would get out of working together. For us the upsides
in terms of branding, sales, and marketing are understood. How would you
envisage Big Spaceship using the platform to create a new, critical
business line for yourselves?

For example, right now we're seeing that most business leaders just don't
have the headspace for cultural messaging, even though now is when it is
most sorely needed. If Big Spaceship can direct and script cultural content
(using leaders where useful/available), Indigo could highlight areas that
need cultural direction and ensure that the right stuff is getting to the
right people at the right time... plus quantify the impact of cultural
messaging to allow for iterative improvement. That's just one practical
outcome, but it's predicated on the idea that Big Spaceship will be
providing cultural direction and consulting to clients ongoing.

Let me know if we're looking in the right direction, or if you have other
thoughts.

Stoked,
Josh
