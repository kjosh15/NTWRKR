Glad you're all well, and nice timing on the parental leave my friend!!

We're in NYC, yes - just ten minute's walk from Elmherst hospital, the
current heart of the pandemic in the USA. It's ... strange. No car traffic,
constant ambulences. A lot of people dying in the middle of beautiful
spring weather. Everyone wears masks and walks six feet apart. We're all
just waiting, but nobody knows for what.

In terms of interesting projects, most of my efforts have been around my
startup (indigometrics.com) which focuses on quantifying peer-to-peer
evaluations of behavior and values. With the sudden rise of remote work we
see a big opportunity to pivot and grow our numbers so lots of thinking
about the future of work happening. What do you think will change
permanently in 3/6/9 months?

And very curious to read your children's novel! My oldest, Othinn, is not 7
and is starting to take to reading very seriously. He could be an excellent
test!

Good to hear from you,
Josh
