Glad you guys are all well - that's the biggest thing. :)

Things here are very strange. The good news is that we made a cell with
some very close neighbors who have kids in the same school and have been
sharing the childcare. The kids love it!! Their school has done a fabulous
job with online content, so each weekday they all sit down and work
together, and the four kids get access to four different parents throughout
the day. That part has been pretty great, and having another family so
closely entwined into our lives has kept us from going quite as bonkers, I
think.

On the downside, the streets are quiet, with almost no traffic aside from
ambulances - which go by at least a few times every hour around the clock.
Whenever you walk outside everyone is wearing a mask and keeps six feet
apart. The city is hushed. People are somber. Everyone knows someone who
recently lost a neighbor, a friend, or a parent. Most of all, we all know
it's going to get much worse, very quickly - the concept of exponential
growth has penetrated the public consciousness, and the implications are
staggering to anticipate.

But, as the saying goes, this too will pass. It's my fervent hope that we
will come out of this stronger, smarter, and better prepared. We've seen
great examples of leadership and planning throughout the world (albeit not
here) and globally we're being reminded of what matters. If nothing else,
living inside so closely, in such an intense emotional place, has proved
the value of family in a whole new way.

Keep safe and healthy, and stay in touch! Hearing from friends is more
important now than ever.

All best,
Josh
