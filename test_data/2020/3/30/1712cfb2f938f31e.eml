Hi Josh,

Just when I thought I had our communication streamlined... things have
changed. Thus, I have to break my promise of sending you a rundown of all
the calls for the week ahead. I'm doing this because *two important
member-requested conversations have been added* for this week.

Tomorrow (Tuesday) we have a member-led collaboration session about
repurposing factories, tooling and supply chains to help during this time.
Since many of you have asked about this specifically, *I'd ask that you
find someone involved in this area to join from your organization*. Would
love to have you, but if you can't join - find the appropriate delegate. No
guest - this is just members sharing what they have done and collaborating
with each other on how they can help.

*Tuesday, March 31 at 11am PT // 1pm CT // 2pm ET // 19.00 BST // 20.00
CEST  <https://app.world50.com/redirects/gathering/7011W000001g7XIQAY>*

*The most powerful aspect of your World 50 membership is access to fellow
peers and a shortcut to the resources you need. In recent days, both
requests for specific assistance as well as members saying, "How can I
help?" have increased substantially. In order to best facilitate these
connections, members are invited to join a virtual town hall meeting to
share requests and needs=E2=80=94and to discuss ways in which fellow member=
s might
provide assistance.*


The other new addition is on Thursday and is all about cash and capital
preservation. Bill George will help guide the conversation, but again this
will be a "huddle" discussion to hear and share how everyone is approaching
the topic.

*Thursday, April 2 at 10am PT // 12pm CT // 1pm ET // 18.00 BST // 19.00
CEST <https://app.world50.com/redirects/gathering/7011W000001g7Z9QAI>*
*As companies are scenario planning to mitigate the risk of COVID-19=E2=80=
=99s
impact on businesses, members from across World 50 will join each other for
a conversation on cash management during these critical times. Bill George
<https://www.billgeorge.org/>, former CEO of Medtronic, will join to offer
perspective from his experience at Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial
crisis.*


Again, my apologies for breaking my promise about the summary of calls in
advance. But I thought these were too important to risk going unnoticed!

Below my signature is the full rundown for this week.

-Mike

Innovating 50, Strategy 50, and Digital 50 members join for a private,
confidential call to share thoughts and ideas related to COVID-19. No
