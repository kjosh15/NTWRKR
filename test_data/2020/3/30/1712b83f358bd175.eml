Wanted to add another $0.02;

If we got an inexpensive, remote place in the forest for two weeks over
spring break, we could go and quarantine without meeting anyone else and
clean it spotless when we left. Medical care is less of an issue than
initially thought, because if anyone begins to show symptoms they'd have to
leave to come home to quarantine themselves anyway.

Being out of the city, out in nature, especially when the kids get a break
from the structure of school could be a nice respite from the intensity
going on here right now. I'm a little concerned about "vacation" inside our
apartments, and also know that a change of scene might break some of the
oppressed feelings they kids have expressed.

Thoughts?
