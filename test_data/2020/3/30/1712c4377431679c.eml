Ponoko is in the midst of a major site update - we're waiting to hear back
from them about a one-click order for the crowbox. In the meantime, you
need to manually upload the .eps files here: https://make.ponoko.com/designs

We'll update everyone as soon as we have a fix. Apologies for the hassle in
the meantime!!
