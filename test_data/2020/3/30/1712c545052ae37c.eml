Just heard back from Steve on this:

"Using an adapter that provides only 250mW would likely cause problems with
the proper operation of the servo and the sliding lid that the servo moves.
Running on amperage this lean also raises the likelihood of 'browning out'
the whole system and causing a reset of the Arduino board each time the
servo tries to open or close the lid. Low amperage could also cause the
servo to improperly sense its own position as it rotates, so the lid may
fail to open or close all the way.

1000mW would be the minimum amperage I would consider using for the
Crowbox- but 2000mW is recommended for reliable operation in all
conditions."

So, probably best not to do it. :)

best,
Josh
