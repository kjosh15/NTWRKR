I look at Indigo for us as a valuable diagnostic tool for the other side of
the "digital transformation" coin - people and teams.

Not to be too cute about it, but I think we'd want to use it as a method of
determining what your *cultural* debt, backlog, stories, epics might be.
And then start to prioritize resources and initiatives against each.

So messaging would be one critical component, but not the only output.

For us to work on the brand/sales/marketing stuff it would probably have to
be some combination of these things (in no particular order):

   - Ongoing free use of the platform for Big Spaceship to master it and
   make feature and functionality suggestions
   - Discounted or free use of it for clients for initial 6 week "scan"
   - Exclusivity to use it as a consultant and/or right of first refusal on
   consulting work coming through Indigo for a material window of time
   - Equity in the company as an "investment of services." Keep in mind
   here - building a new service on top of someone else's platform carries
   enormous risk even when that platform is scaled and established (see
   Facebook and media/publishing). When the company is less established, th=
e
   risk increases because there are are the dual risks of insolvency and
   acquisition - both of  which could lead to having a service based on a
   platform that we no longer have any access to.

Apologies if this comes across super blunt, but I don't even have time to
read it over and feel that hopefully we're at the point that you know I'm
not an asshole.

As for the talking points for the podcast... As I think I've mentioned,
I've been working on a whole approach/methodology/system about the
agile/adaptive organization (I prefer adaptive, but may succumb to the halo
value of the word agile) - that Agile was a response to structural
limitations in software development and now the world is being eaten by
software, so it's superstructures become a higher order framework for how
to do business in a software-driven world. Happy to share thoughts on this
specifically for the talking points, but would love to find a way to get a
bit of credit for it, either as part of, or separate from the stuff above.

Zoom chat tomorrow? Today is just relentless.
