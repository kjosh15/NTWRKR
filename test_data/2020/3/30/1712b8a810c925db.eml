This week in NYC innovation

Welcome to all the newsletter newcomers!

Each week=2C we share events and news out of the NYC tech community--but i=
n recent weeks=2C our local scene has gone national=2C hosting lots of vir=
tual events.

On Thursday of last week=2C I had the opportunity to interview Brad Feld o=
f Foundry Group and Todd Dagres of Spark Capital about dealing with a turb=
ulent part of the economy and the venture capital cycle. They are veteran=
 VCs who were investing around the Dot Com bust=2C 9/11 and the Financial=
 Crisis and they had a lot of great info to share (https://www.youtube.com=
/watch?v=3Dpc7KzL1dNcg&mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) .

_____

Welcome to the era of lead generation through content.

Seriously=2C if you're trying to sell something now while everyone is bunk=
ered up in their houses if it isn't grocery delivery or a home workout=2C=
 you're going to have a hard time.

However=2C people are looking for information and guidance. What can you s=
hare with your current customers and potential new ones that positions you=
 as a trusted thought leader during a difficult time?

Your teams should be focused on expanding your funnel now=2C so that they=
 have a ton of people to convert when everyone is ready to buy again. Star=
t running weekly webinars and producing daily video content like interview=
s with experts with easy professional tools like Openreel (https://www.ope=
nreel.com/?mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])  (video (https://vimeo.=
com/399930086/625136005d?mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) ). People=
 are in information consumption mode--and if you don't make an impression=
 now=2C you're going to have a difficult time finding your way to the top=
 of the pile when people get back to normal later.

If you're not sure your team can do this on their own=2C reach out to Weth=
os (http://wethos.co/?mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) and they'll=
 spin up a team and a strategy for you.

(Both portfolio co's of course!)

And Openreel is hiring for Client Success positions=2C too! (https://www.l=
inkedin.com/jobs/cap/view/1772065409/?pathWildcard=3D1772065409&trk=3Dmcm&=
mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID])

_____

Speaking of which--if you have an accelerator or community looking for a s=
peaker for a virtual event or webinar=2C hit me up. I usually say yes to m=
ost invitations to connect with startups (I don't do Office Hours=2C but I=
 can talk to you about a form of them that I do like). Just reply here.

Also=2C we are creating 75% off discount codes for April for accelerator a=
nd other startup communities for Feedback.vc (http://www.feedback.vc?mc_ci=
d=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]) --the only way to test the viability of=
 your fundraise ahead of time anonymously. Let us know if we can help your=
 group with a code. It's going to get really hard to fundraise in this env=
ironment--so you need to know that you're putting your best foot forward.

_____

And now=2C for some good news...

Before we went into hiding=2C we were planning on running our 5th Pre-Seri=
es A Offsite on April 16th. Obviously=2C we canceled it=2C but given how q=
uickly we've all shifted over to virtual events=2C we've decided to host a=
 form of it online.

Starting at noon on April 16th=2C fifty top pre-Series A companies will be=
 invited to connect virtually with a dozen VCs from firms like Lightspeed=
=2C Highland=2C Foundation and Homebrew for timely panels and interactive=
 small group breakouts.

If you are a NYC company=2C and have yet to raise your Series A=2C apply h=
ere:

Do you have employees that are nervous about their financial outlook? Appr=
oximately 62 percent of Americans reported feeling stressed about money--a=
nd that was in 2017. It's been more than eleven years since a graduating c=
ollege class had to face a downturn in the economy--so many of your employ=
ees haven't seen anything like this (not that any of us have).

The Financial Gym is currently working with clients to help them navigate=
 through the challenges of watching retirement accounts drop by 30%+=2C pl=
aning for possible job loss=2C building up an emergency fund=2C or explain=
ing your refinancing and student loan debt options and more.

The greatest and consistent compliment they're receiving is praise from ou=
r clients that they have someone to help them navigate through these diffi=
cult times.

Have you considered offering this to your employees as a wellness benefit?

The Financial Gym can work with employees individually or provide virtual=
 classes to help them improve their financial health. For employees you ma=
y have to let go=2C you could include a one-year membership with The Finan=
cial Gym as part of their severance package.

They are offering a number of discounts on our Employer Programs for April=
 and they would love to talk to you more about them.

Sign up to find out more here: https://financialgym.com/corporate-partners=
hips?mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc_eid=3D[UNIQID]

Are you concerned about your own finances? Tune in for their webinar this=
 week (https://financialgym.com/nyc-finance-classes?mc_cid=3D97e4426db8&mc=

We are continuing our "neighborhood" dinner series virtually. We'll be con=
vening a group of Williamsburg neighbors over Zoom for dinner on Wednesday=
 (there are still two spots open) and will be hosting Westchester=2C the L=
ower East Side=2C and Sunset Park soon.

When I was about 11 or 12=2C we used to sit in the yard of a neighbor duri=
ng the summer. He would bring out his boombox and play Dark Side of the Mo=
on while we all played chess under a floodlight he would clamp to his fenc=
e.

Since we're all sitting at home=2C we can set whatever soundtrack we want=
 as we join an online chess club for the tech and startup community in NYC=
=2E

We're looking for this to be as inclusive a club as possible--so if you're=
 a member of an underrepresented community had haven't played a lot before=
=2C but would like to=2C please do feel welcome to join.

One of the common questions I get from Angular developers is: =E2=80=9CWha=
t is the proper way to apply DOM manipulation?=E2=80=9DWhen working with A=
ngular=2C we never manipulate the DOM directly. Angular provides us a thic=

=2C which can translate into DOM manipulation - or any other runtime platf=
orm.In this special meetup=2C I will dive into Angular=E2=80=99s view laye=
