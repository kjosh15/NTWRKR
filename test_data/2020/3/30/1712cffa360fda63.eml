It's fucking surreal over here. No car or foot traffic, just endless
ambulences. That said, we made a cell with another family and the kids are
absolutely loving the home schooling. I'm used to working from home, so no
real big difference there. The biggest difference is that all of a sudden
the overton window for tech got blown wide open and I'm trying to figure
out where to put my weight - it's terrible to say, but this pandemic is
making some incredible opportunity.

See you're still doing the TV thing - how the hell is that with COVID-19
protections?!?
