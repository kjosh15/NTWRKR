Good to hear from you! I could do a call Tuesday or Wednesday at 15:00 or
17:00, or Friday at 18:00 your time. Let me know what works for you.
Fortunately (or unfortunately, really) the coronavirus has pushed back ALL
schedules, so a mid-April launch still works for me.

Looking forward to it,
Josh
