Here's a rough outline of notes both to pitch to W50 for a podcast and for
use as the basis of a medium article. Any/all feedback appreciated -
there's a lot of fat to cut here, plus I want to REALLY sharpen the bit
about benefits. As usual, am including both carrot and stick here!

#Overview:

Your employees are more autonomous than ever before
They're going through a traumatic time and are paying immaculate attention
to their workplace for signals on how to adapt
Even if they discover and distribute a vaccine tomorrow, things will be
different

# Risk:
Conduct risk: nobody in reinforcing "how we act"
IP theft: It's easier to be approached online, and harder to feel bad about
stealing from a literally faceless company
Employee churn: What's to stop employees from spending their days watching
job boards? The higher their value, the bigger the temptation.
Efficiency drift: In an office, KPIs are one metric. In WFH, they're the
ONLY metric.
Burnout: We're already seeing how commute times are being replaced by (yet
more) time on devices... working.
Dissent: If you're organizing your work online it's not much harder to
organize your protest.
The wrong metrics: You need metrics, but it's easy to assign the wrong ones
- which can lead to the above.
Privacy: many companies will go full-on panopticon. There's no better way
to kill productivity.

# Opportunity:
Leaping ahead of the competition: if you empower your employees now, they
can act on your behalf in a million new / unknown ways
If you clearly articulate your values, your employees will align around
them in the absence of anything else
If you support your employees, they will be grateful
It's never been cheaper to "give" your employees things (like time, access,
freedom, new projects, etc.)
It's never been cheaper to mass-message to provide psychological safety
You have the opportunity to create clear feedback loops for both soft AND
hard skills, effectively doubling your performance measurement overnight
As everything is beaing recreated you can craft the new normal: designing
for autonomy, scale, and flexibility allows you to boostrap your company
past existing beurocracy

# What to do:
Avoid the temptation to clamp down and control - things which the
technology will appear to allow you to do
Optimize for a future state different from today's: one which is emergent,
organic, and more autonomous
Find and use metrics which include both hard and soft skills (this is the
"killer app" of the workforce of tomorrow)
Create dynamic, ongoing, iterative feedback loops - and make your employees
the core unit within them

# Summary:
We can either attempt to clamp down and control employees more completely -
which technology will exacerbate
Or we can empower them to be better employees - which decades of research
has indicated produces better outcomes
If we create systems that produce organic, emergent, iterative outcomes
including both hard AND soft skills we can bootstrap out companies past
existing beaurocracies to seize advantage
