We've talked about it before, but I have a platform that lets groups
anonymous evaluate each other's behavior around core values. It works
pretty well for even small groups like ours, and gives each member
visibility into where they're being perceived as lacking and leading
relative to the group. It takes 3 minutes once a week.

I thought it would be interesting for us to use as a way of understanding
each other and how the team is getting along over the course of the
pandemic, and could be a really interesting (and data led) element to the
story of how our two families teamed up.

To run it we'd need to identify 5-6 core values. I'll toss out a few just
as straw men:

- Honesty
- Listening
- Participation
- Consideration
- Growth mindset
- Equality

Let me know if you guys are game, and if so what values you think would be
best, and I'll get this all set up!

best,
Josh
