Ok, it=E2=80=99s going on the list. I=E2=80=99m a big believer in cast iron=
 (they=E2=80=99re the
only pans we use) but being able to quickly flip a pan=E2=80=99s contents c=
ould be
a game changer.

Love,
Josh

Here it is all preseasoned - 4 or 5 times. <br>

 the weight if our same-size cast iron pan). <br>
