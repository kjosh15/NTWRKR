hanks again for the second conversation; seems like lots of connections her=
e!<br><br>One of the questions you had was about the type of work I did for=
 IDEO. Obviously I can&#39;t discuss anything not publicly known about IDEO=
, their business, processes, clients, etc. etc. but I&#39;m happy to outlin=
e the type of strategy work I&#39;ve done in the past inasmuch as it pertai=
ns to the kind of work I could help BigSpaceship with. <br><br>Specifically=
, this type of strategy work has often involved:<br><br>	- conducting one-o=
n-one interviews with stakeholders across all offices to understand the bus=
iness prerogatives, assets, and opportunities.<br>	- Conducting expert inte=
rviews with external clients, potential clients, area experts, and competit=
ors.<br>	- Synthesised these interviews through a strategic framework eithe=
r native to the client (such as IDEO&#39;s Play To Win approach) or externa=
l as best fits the needs of the client.<br>	- Expand the strategic recommen=
dation to areas of immediate impact<br>	- Draw out those areas to detail pr=
ocesses, key KPIs with initial tests for validation, and anticipated outcom=
es with paired response strategies.<br>	- Create a timeline for test execut=
ion, evaluation/validation, and revision.<br>	- Indexes of all working mate=
rial for later analysis and reference, the formal strategy process, example=
 content (if any are related), detailed deliverables descriptions and requi=
rements, and any additional value-add insights otherwise outside of the str=
ategic approach.<br><br>Put in human-speak, I dig deeply into the company, =
detail all the opportunities and problems that pertain to the project goal,=
 use a formal strategic method to force rigor in shaping a recommendation, =
and then detail that recommendation into a series of actionable tests that =
can be used to validate progress towards the recommended goal(s). <br><br>T=
hat&#39;s one type of project I&#39;ve really enjoyed in the past, and have=
 done variations for several organizations. Outside of that, and based on w=
hat I know of Big Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I&#39;ve also done a lot=
 of:<br><br>	- Technology advising. I&#39;ve helped shape the technological=
 approach for literally hundreds of projects, processes, companies, startup=
s, R&amp;D divisions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is not in ou=
tlining code structures or hacking together prototypes, but in articulating=
 the value proposition for the client and identifying strategic opportuniti=
es from a diverse set of technologies and business elements to create resul=
ts that are more than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic innovation =
consulting; this is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39;s clients that underwr=
ote my strategy work. <br><br>	- Managing clients and creating partnerships=
. One of the weird side effects of being an executive-whisperer is that I&#=
39;ve got a unique perspective on the global market, the ways that emerging=
 technologies can be harnessed, and where otherwise obtuse partnerships cou=
ld make great sense. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV interviews, ar=
ticles, books, radio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a more comple=
te list at <a href=3D"http://josh.is/writing/" target=3D"_blank">josh.is/wr=
iting/</a><br><br>	- Program development. I&#39;ve built the Trust Model fo=
r Consumer reports, an incubator for IMAX, a social good platform for the C=
MO of Coke, etc.<br><br>Finally, I also think I could do well at Business D=
evelopment. Because I&#39;ve spent nearly two decades freelancing in NY and=
 globally, and because for the last decade that&#39;s been almost exclusive=
ly and directly to senior executives of major multinationals, I&#39;ve got =
an excellent and unusual network. While I&#39;ve used this network to secur=
e funding for startups, to cross-sell solutions from same, and to develop p=
roject partnerships, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusively. But I think I could=
 do a pretty good job of it.<br><br>Let me know if any of this is food for =
thought. I hear you that we&#39;d need to find a client project to attach t=
o, but I&#39;m hopeful we can find something that would work collaborativel=
y to help build other initiatives. Happy to discuss any of the above furthe=
r in a call or f2f!<br><br>best,<br>Josh=C2=A0<br></div><div hspace=3D"stre=
