Joshua,

Not cheap, but a lot cheaper than the alternative (which I would love to 
own a few pieces of - chafing dish, et cetera).

The parent company is Solidteknics in Australia: 
https://www.solidteknics.com/

They now make pans in the US (Chicago area): https://solidteknicsusa.com/

I believe both are available on Amazon.

As I see it, the big difference is; do you want an outline of the US or 
Australia as your hang-up hole in the handle (look closely, you'll see it).

Now, here's the premier version (based in Seattle, I might add): 
https://bluskilletironware.com/

FWIW, I got the 12 inch US skillet

Enjoy the reading, it's fun to speculate what you might want.

Love,

DAD
