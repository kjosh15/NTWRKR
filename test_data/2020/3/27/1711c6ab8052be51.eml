I've been in touch with a team of research groups at the University of
Waterloo, the Canadian University Hospitals, and DarwinAI who have launched
an AI initiative in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

They've developed an open source deep neural network for detecting COVID-19
infections from chest X-rays (with AI explanations) for use as an
open-sourced primary screening tool:

https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net.

They're looking for COVID-19 x-ray images, expertise with model
improvements, funding to support the teams, and any connections with the
right agencies and institutions. Can you help?

Hope you and yours are safe and healthy,
Josh
