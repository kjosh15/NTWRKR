r the second conversation; seems like lots of connections here!<br><br>One =
of the questions you had was about the type of work I did for IDEO. Obvious=
ly I can&#39;t discuss anything not publicly known about IDEO, their busine=
ss, processes, clients, etc. etc. but I&#39;m happy to outline the type of =
strategy work I&#39;ve done in the past inasmuch as it pertains to the kind=
 of work I could help BigSpaceship with. <br><br>Specifically, this type of=
 strategy work has often involved:<br><br>	- conducting one-on-one intervie=
ws with stakeholders across all offices to understand the business prerogat=
ives, assets, and opportunities.<br>	- Conducting expert interviews with ex=
ternal clients, potential clients, area experts, and competitors.<br>	- Syn=
thesised these interviews through a strategic framework either native to th=
e client (such as IDEO&#39;s Play To Win approach) or external as best fits=
 the needs of the client.<br>	- Expand the strategic recommendation to area=
s of immediate impact<br>	- Draw out those areas to detail processes, key K=
PIs with initial tests for validation, and anticipated outcomes with paired=
 response strategies.<br>	- Create a timeline for test execution, evaluatio=
n/validation, and revision.<br>	- Indexes of all working material for later=
 analysis and reference, the formal strategy process, example content (if a=
ny are related), detailed deliverables descriptions and requirements, and a=
ny additional value-add insights otherwise outside of the strategic approac=
h.<br><br>Put in human-speak, I dig deeply into the company, detail all the=
 opportunities and problems that pertain to the project goal, use a formal =
strategic method to force rigor in shaping a recommendation, and then detai=
l that recommendation into a series of actionable tests that can be used to=
 validate progress towards the recommended goal(s). <br><br>That&#39;s one =
type of project I&#39;ve really enjoyed in the past, and have done variatio=
ns for several organizations. Outside of that, and based on what I know of =
Big Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I&#39;ve also done a lot of:<br><br>	-=
 Technology advising. I&#39;ve helped shape the technological approach for =
literally hundreds of projects, processes, companies, startups, R&amp;D div=
isions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is not in outlining code s=
tructures or hacking together prototypes, but in articulating the value pro=
position for the client and identifying strategic opportunities from a dive=
rse set of technologies and business elements to create results that are mo=
re than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic innovation consulting; th=
is is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39;s clients that underwrote my strateg=
y work. <br><br>	- Managing clients and creating partnerships. One of the w=
eird side effects of being an executive-whisperer is that I&#39;ve got a un=
ique perspective on the global market, the ways that emerging technologies =
can be harnessed, and where otherwise obtuse partnerships could make great =
sense. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV interviews, articles, books,=
 radio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a more complete list at <a =
href=3D"http://josh.is/writing/" target=3D"_blank">josh.is/writing/</a><br>=
<br>	- Program development. I&#39;ve built the Trust Model for Consumer rep=
orts, an incubator for IMAX, a social good platform for the CMO of Coke, et=
c.<br><br>Finally, I also think I could do well at Business Development. Be=
cause I&#39;ve spent nearly two decades freelancing in NY and globally, and=
 because for the last decade that&#39;s been almost exclusively and directl=
y to senior executives of major multinationals, I&#39;ve got an excellent a=
nd unusual network. While I&#39;ve used this network to secure funding for =
startups, to cross-sell solutions from same, and to develop project partner=
ships, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusively. But I think I could do a pretty g=
ood job of it.<br><br>Let me know if any of this is food for thought. I hea=
r you that we&#39;d need to find a client project to attach to, but I&#39;m=
 hopeful we can find something that would work collaboratively to help buil=
d other initiatives. Happy to discuss any of the above further in a call or=
