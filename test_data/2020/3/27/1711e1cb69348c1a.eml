Joshua,

I found they article interesting, although sounding like it was written by a=
n attorney; by-in-large looking at the downside in an effort to protect thei=
r audience from suddenly finding themselves in a worse-than-expected positio=
n. This is understandable because when dealing with facts/scientific data th=
ere is no place for optimism, simply conclusions drawn from/shown by the dat=
a.=20

As to the meditation, I found it Not-One-Bit comforting or beneficial. All I=
 kept finding myself doing was wondering why this clown thought throwing obs=
cenities an vulgarities at me was supposed to relax me. Aside from being off=
ended, the only other effect was to cause me to be more tense and upset with=
 the lack of respect and decorum that this - - - individual (to be kind) was=
 indicating is a norm in our society. This latter potentially being the case=
, perhaps a corona virus killing off large segments of the population is a g=
ood thing. I wonder at which fractions of the population are being killed of=
f versus which fractions Should Be killed off. Ugh!

Love,=20
