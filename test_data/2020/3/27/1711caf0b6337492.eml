iv dir=3D"ltr">Michael,<br><br>Thanks again for the second conversation; se=
ems like lots of connections here!<br><br>One of the questions you had was =
about the type of work I did for IDEO. Obviously I can&#39;t discuss anythi=
ng not publicly known about IDEO, their business, processes, clients, etc. =
etc. but I&#39;m happy to outline the type of strategy work I&#39;ve done i=
n the past inasmuch as it pertains to the kind of work I could help BigSpac=
eship with. <br><br>Specifically, this type of strategy work has often invo=
lved:<br><br>	- conducting one-on-one interviews with stakeholders across a=
ll offices to understand the business prerogatives, assets, and opportuniti=
es.<br>	- Conducting expert interviews with external clients, potential cli=
ents, area experts, and competitors.<br>	- Synthesised these interviews thr=
ough a strategic framework either native to the client (such as IDEO&#39;s =
Play To Win approach) or external as best fits the needs of the client.<br>=
	- Expand the strategic recommendation to areas of immediate impact<br>	- D=
raw out those areas to detail processes, key KPIs with initial tests for va=
lidation, and anticipated outcomes with paired response strategies.<br>	- C=
reate a timeline for test execution, evaluation/validation, and revision.<b=
r>	- Indexes of all working material for later analysis and reference, the =
formal strategy process, example content (if any are related), detailed del=
iverables descriptions and requirements, and any additional value-add insig=
hts otherwise outside of the strategic approach.<br><br>Put in human-speak,=
 I dig deeply into the company, detail all the opportunities and problems t=
hat pertain to the project goal, use a formal strategic method to force rig=
or in shaping a recommendation, and then detail that recommendation into a =
series of actionable tests that can be used to validate progress towards th=
e recommended goal(s). <br><br>That&#39;s one type of project I&#39;ve real=
ly enjoyed in the past, and have done variations for several organizations.=
 Outside of that, and based on what I know of Big Spaceship&#39;s business =
so far, I&#39;ve also done a lot of:<br><br>	- Technology advising. I&#39;v=
e helped shape the technological approach for literally hundreds of project=
s, processes, companies, startups, R&amp;D divisions, incubators, TV series=
, and more. My role is not in outlining code structures or hacking together=
 prototypes, but in articulating the value proposition for the client and i=
dentifying strategic opportunities from a diverse set of technologies and b=
usiness elements to create results that are more than the sum of their part=
s. Call it strategic innovation consulting; this is a lot of what I did for=
 IDEO&#39;s clients that underwrote my strategy work. <br><br>	- Managing c=
lients and creating partnerships. One of the weird side effects of being an=
 executive-whisperer is that I&#39;ve got a unique perspective on the globa=
l market, the ways that emerging technologies can be harnessed, and where o=
therwise obtuse partnerships could make great sense. <br><br>	- Thought Lea=
dership. I.e., TV interviews, articles, books, radio interviews, blog/podca=
sts, etc. etc. See a more complete list at <a href=3D"http://josh.is/writin=
g/" target=3D"_blank">josh.is/writing/</a><br><br>	- Program development. I=
&#39;ve built the Trust Model for Consumer reports, an incubator for IMAX, =
a social good platform for the CMO of Coke, etc.<br><br>Finally, I also thi=
nk I could do well at Business Development. Because I&#39;ve spent nearly t=
wo decades freelancing in NY and globally, and because for the last decade =
that&#39;s been almost exclusively and directly to senior executives of maj=
or multinationals, I&#39;ve got an excellent and unusual network. While I&#=
39;ve used this network to secure funding for startups, to cross-sell solut=
ions from same, and to develop project partnerships, I haven&#39;t done BD =
exclusively. But I think I could do a pretty good job of it.<br><br>Let me =
know if any of this is food for thought. I hear you that we&#39;d need to f=
ind a client project to attach to, but I&#39;m hopeful we can find somethin=
g that would work collaboratively to help build other initiatives. Happy to=
 discuss any of the above further in a call or f2f!<br><br>best,<br>Josh=C2=
