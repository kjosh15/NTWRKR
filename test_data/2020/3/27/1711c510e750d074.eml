"ltr">Michael,<br><br>Thanks again for the second conversation; seems like =
lots of connections here!<br><br>One of the questions you had was about the=
 type of work I did for IDEO. Obviously I can&#39;t discuss anything not pu=
blicly known about IDEO, their business, processes, clients, etc. etc. but =
I&#39;m happy to outline the type of strategy work I&#39;ve done in the pas=
t inasmuch as it pertains to the kind of work I could help BigSpaceship wit=
h. <br><br>Specifically, this type of strategy work has often involved:<br>=
<br>	- conducting one-on-one interviews with stakeholders across all office=
s to understand the business prerogatives, assets, and opportunities.<br>	-=
 Conducting expert interviews with external clients, potential clients, are=
a experts, and competitors.<br>	- Synthesised these interviews through a st=
rategic framework either native to the client (such as IDEO&#39;s Play To W=
in approach) or external as best fits the needs of the client.<br>	- Expand=
 the strategic recommendation to areas of immediate impact<br>	- Draw out t=
hose areas to detail processes, key KPIs with initial tests for validation,=
 and anticipated outcomes with paired response strategies.<br>	- Create a t=
imeline for test execution, evaluation/validation, and revision.<br>	- Inde=
xes of all working material for later analysis and reference, the formal st=
rategy process, example content (if any are related), detailed deliverables=
 descriptions and requirements, and any additional value-add insights other=
wise outside of the strategic approach.<br><br>Put in human-speak, I dig de=
eply into the company, detail all the opportunities and problems that perta=
in to the project goal, use a formal strategic method to force rigor in sha=
ping a recommendation, and then detail that recommendation into a series of=
 actionable tests that can be used to validate progress towards the recomme=
nded goal(s). <br><br>That&#39;s one type of project I&#39;ve really enjoye=
d in the past, and have done variations for several organizations. Outside =
of that, and based on what I know of Big Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I=
&#39;ve also done a lot of:<br><br>	- Technology advising. I&#39;ve helped =
shape the technological approach for literally hundreds of projects, proces=
ses, companies, startups, R&amp;D divisions, incubators, TV series, and mor=
e. My role is not in outlining code structures or hacking together prototyp=
es, but in articulating the value proposition for the client and identifyin=
g strategic opportunities from a diverse set of technologies and business e=
lements to create results that are more than the sum of their parts. Call i=
t strategic innovation consulting; this is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39=
;s clients that underwrote my strategy work. <br><br>	- Managing clients an=
d creating partnerships. One of the weird side effects of being an executiv=
e-whisperer is that I&#39;ve got a unique perspective on the global market,=
 the ways that emerging technologies can be harnessed, and where otherwise =
obtuse partnerships could make great sense. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. =
I.e., TV interviews, articles, books, radio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc.=
 etc. See a more complete list at <a href=3D"http://josh.is/writing/" targe=
t=3D"_blank">josh.is/writing/</a><br><br>	- Program development. I&#39;ve b=
uilt the Trust Model for Consumer reports, an incubator for IMAX, a social =
good platform for the CMO of Coke, etc.<br><br>Finally, I also think I coul=
d do well at Business Development. Because I&#39;ve spent nearly two decade=
s freelancing in NY and globally, and because for the last decade that&#39;=
s been almost exclusively and directly to senior executives of major multin=
ationals, I&#39;ve got an excellent and unusual network. While I&#39;ve use=
d this network to secure funding for startups, to cross-sell solutions from=
 same, and to develop project partnerships, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusive=
ly. But I think I could do a pretty good job of it.<br><br>Let me know if a=
ny of this is food for thought. I hear you that we&#39;d need to find a cli=
ent project to attach to, but I&#39;m hopeful we can find something that wo=
uld work collaboratively to help build other initiatives. Happy to discuss =
any of the above further in a call or f2f!<br><br>best,<br>Josh=C2=A0<br></=
