Mike,

Wanted to drop you a note that I recently spoke with Todd Asher who manages
smart cities data for Bloomberg. Their focus is on empowering city
governments (they're the nonprofit branch) and while he could possibly pass
on introductions, in his experience bigger cities don't need executive
access as much as smaller ones. To put it another way, if you had a way of
isolating members who were interested in specific cities for business
purposes, Todd could help connect the dots to get support on the ground for
introductions and information about those opportunities.

Let me know if this is helpful and/or of interest and I'll make
introductions!

All best,
Josh
