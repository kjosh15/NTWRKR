<div dir=3D"ltr">Vikram,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I LOVE this!! The=C2=A0game design / reality tv approach is genius, al=
though I think it could be really sharpened by tying it into one of the (ma=
ny) corporate sponsored efforts being made around any number of environment=
al impact programs right now.=C2=A0</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For example, Estonia developed an app to gamify picking up litter in t=
heir forests, and transformed both the countryside and civic engagement. Po=
kemon=C2=A0Go (I know the lead developers) was used to spin off exercise pr=
ograms for obesity fighting campaigns
 in the midwest. Carma Carpooling helps you find nearby people to share you=
r commute to reduce traffic and emissions. Dropcountr enables you to conser=
ve water by connecting you to your water utility company via your smartphon=
e. Farmstand helps you discover
 locally grown food from more than 8,700 farmers markets.=C2=A0Just google =
&quot;IOS games for environmental impact&quot; and you can find plenty of a=
pps which gamified specific environmental initiatives well above and beyond=
 straight &quot;edutainment.&quot;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Fundamentally, I think you&#39;ve got all the right elements, but if y=
ou take a different &quot;campaign&quot; each episode from a large corporat=
e sponsor you could a) fund the winning team, b) get additional investment =
for production, c) increase media footprint for
 the corporate, d) tie it into real-world impact, and e) give a short summa=
ry of the previous episode&#39;s impact with each show.=C2=A0</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Does this sound on point? Would love to brianstorm further if you thin=
k there&#39;s a there there!</div>
