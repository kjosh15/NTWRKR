The question in my mind is how we articulate this and tie it to a
mission-critical function or problem a large percent of companies have.
I.e., it's now widely being recognized that culture is a critical function
- but not that different companies do and should have different, individual
cultures.

Maybe it's a matter of pointing out that geography, background, industry,
etc. all require different cultures to be successful, and that this is a
dynamic target that's ever evolving? That still feels like a weak push.
Thoughts?
