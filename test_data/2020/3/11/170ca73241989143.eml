"Giving an identity" rings of totalitarianism, to my (US-centric) mind.

OTOH, "we only help the olds" doesn't do much for us either.

What's the middle ground? I'd say more along the lines of, "we don't
dictate your culture to you - we help you cultivate your best, most
effective culture for your particular market conditions... *and keep you
and every single one of your employees* improving in lockstep with said
conditions, as they evolve."

Something like that?
