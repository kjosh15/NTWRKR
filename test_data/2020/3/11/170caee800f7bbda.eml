Hello, and thank you for contacting FitMetrix by MINDBODY.

I was able to find it is not meant to work in IE only. Chrome is essentiall=
y our preferred browser. The errors you're seeing in the console for "FITME=
TRIX" not being a defined object are nothing to worry about. That's suppose=
d to happen in Chrome.

Depending if WIX is being used or Spacecraft for example. The Articles can =
be found within in the Help Suite in the link below. I plugged in the best =
phrase to display options that should work best for what you are looking fo=
r.

Wanted to update you that I rewrote the iframe code your site suggests:

=A0

<iframe src=3D"https://www.fitmetrix.io/memberportal/register/1a72bd3e-2d44=
-ea11-aa59-d942907bbf75 <https://www.fitmetrix.io/memberportal/register/1a7=
2bd3e-2d44-ea11-aa59-d942907bbf75>" onload=3D'javascript:(function(o){o.sty=
le.height=3Do.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+"px";}(this));' styl=
e=3D"height:1600px;width:100%;border:none;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>

=A0

This causes it to artificially force the height to be too long (1600px), wh=
ich resolves better than before, but height=3D"100%" doesn't work. Obviousl=
y we want your iframe to appear as 100% height without errors, neither of w=
hich is a true condition at the moment. Please advise.
