Ha! Ok, that was my mistake. Please look again at:

http://fithit.com/class-schedule/

Otherwise yes, we're still waiting to tell us how we *should* be
implementing their code - putting in artificial pixel heights for their
iFrame won't resolve well across devices and is causing additional .js
conflicts. We're also still seeing all the same errors we were getting
before.

Outside of that, let me know if the pages that you need are at least
functional for Friday's launch!
