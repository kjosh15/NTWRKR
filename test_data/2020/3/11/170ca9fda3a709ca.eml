If you go here:

http://fithit.com/class-schedule/

You should be able to see the page regardless of whether you are logged in
or not. Am I not understanding the problem?

Otherwise yes, we're still waiting on MindBody. At this point I've pulled
out all the hacks I can think of to get something propped up that doesn't
look like dogfood, but the core issues remain that MindBody was built for
Squarespace and they're not supporting our site.

IMHO they misrepresented themselves: their code clearly isn't playing
nicely with other libraries, the samples and "copy/paste" code they
provided needed heavy modification to work, and there are numerous errors
(many of which are invisible to the user) even when it appears to work.
Their support has been mostly nonexistent (on my call w/ Megan she
basically said "I'm not technical but can't give you technical support.")

Let me know what they say and/or if I can add more to the class schedule
page issue.
