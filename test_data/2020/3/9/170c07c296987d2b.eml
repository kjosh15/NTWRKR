 touch base and address the situation. <br><br>I have tried several times t=
o coach Josh through the coding on the pages. There are a few spots where J=
osh, has not followed the instructions that were provided and as a result t=

pply the fix to a few of the pages but for whatever reason, has not done so=
 with all of the pages you need.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is as far as I =
am able to go. I am unable to go into the website and correct the errors fo=
r you, as much as I wish I could. Implementing the web pages is a DIY proce=
ss- one that typically goes smoothly when a web developer is involved. But =
aside from reiterating where the error in the iFrame resizer =C2=A0is and h=
ighlighting where to put the template links, there is not much else I am ab=
le to assist with. <br><br>If you=E2=80=99d like, I can send Josh the instr=
uctions on how to fix the pages again. But it=E2=80=99s up to him to apply =
them. <br><br><br>________________________________<br>From: Steven Russo &l=

Megan,<br><br>=C2=A0<br><br>Steven Russo of FitHit asked me to insert your =
iframe codes into their wordpress install. I have done so, but encountered =
several problems:<br><br>=C2=A0<br><br>1. I couldn&#39;t find a registratio=
n page, so couldn&#39;t insert the code there.<br>2. I&#39;m not clear on *=
where* to insert the code for the Instructors page.<br>3. All the other ins=
