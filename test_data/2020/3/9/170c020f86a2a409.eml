&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for this! I can already think of a =
few people to pass this to. Can you follow up with an email contextualizing=
 this for small, medium, and large clients? I tend to work mostly with the =
latter and some with the former, and not as often with the midsize (althoug=
h that is a new target for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).<br>&gt;&gt;<=
br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The difficult problem for large enterprises - and a=
ny enterprise with a large supplier network - is third party risk managemen=
t: How do I get a basic level of assurance on the software coming into my e=
nterprise, particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendor=
s, on a continuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s gre=
en today might be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app th=
at your web agency developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some =
venture-backed startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about securi=
ty). <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How do you automate transparency on those inb=
ound deliverables (and their updates) developed outside your boundary?<br>&=
gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so=
 that suppliers are on the hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabili=
ties emerge?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How does this become a tractable proce=
ss for procurement and vendor management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled wi=
th cyber forensics that they=E2=80=99re not staffed to take on? <br>&gt;&gt=
;<br>&gt;&gt; This is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provi=
sions, and meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as=
 known-vulnerability terms of cyber insurance policies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt=
;&gt; An example:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) The supplier deliverable (eith=
er pro services app development or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior t=
o procurement. Governance criteria are enforced. For instance, the large ba=
nks have prohibited components lists - if you have certain Python libraries=
 in your product (containing malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not=
 going to sell that product to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to=
 procurement. One of the big banks requires an SBOM for full pricing - any =
product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if it gets procured at=
 all.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM eve=
ry day, parallel to whatever the supplier is doing for assurance.<br>&gt;&g=
t;<br>&gt;&gt; 3) If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new crit=
ical vulnerability), that change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - sec=
urity SLAs - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has to push an up=
date that remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stamp with third p=
arty certification that the supplier has met the provision or not, in which=
 case there might be remedies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt; Does this make sense?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; =
JC<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Separately, any thinking=
 you may have on how to propose a workable deployment with gov&#39;t would =
be hugely appreciated.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt;&gt; Josh<=
