If I was ten years younger I would send you an emoji of a star shooting
through the sky. With a smiley face. And a thumbs-up.

Instead, I'm a literate adult so you just get a bunch of words.

Thanks!!

 SBOM for full pricing - any product without an SBOM is subject to a 40% di=
scount if it gets procured at all.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2) Ion Channel r=
uns analysis on that SBOM every day, parallel to whatever the supplier is d=
oing for assurance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3) If the deliverable moves fro=
m green to red (e.g. new critical vulnerability), that change is time-stamp=
ed. Contract provisions - security SLAs - can specify how many hours/days t=
he supplier has to push an update that remediates the vulnerability, and se=
e the time stamp with third party certification that the supplier has met t=
he provision or not, in which case there might be remedies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br=
>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Does this make sense?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=

&gt; Separately, any thinking you may have on how to propose a workable dep=
loyment with gov&#39;t would be hugely appreciated.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;=
