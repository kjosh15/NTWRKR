Two updates and one question:

1. We've got some #'s on the microtargeting/real estate offer and are
looking for brokers who might want to run a pilot (based on our
conversations with Blackrock and Blackstone they seem like the most likely
users). Happy to provide more info if this is of interest.

2. We managed to get introduced to the lawyer who built Stephen Colbert's
super PAC and he's interested in supporting us in building one. We got to
him through a high-net-worth who's covering all funding, so if it happens I
think we're sorted on this side.

3. My own startup (indigometrics.com) may be looking for funding; we're
about to sign a 50k+ sized client and have seen a 10x uptick in interest
this year so far and want to get ahead of it. Normally I would look to my
angel contacts (or even VC) but I've been hearing a lot from PE sources who
are looking for much smaller / diverse deals. Do you have any thoughts on
this?

Hope you're well and virus-free (inasmuch as anyone knows they are!)
