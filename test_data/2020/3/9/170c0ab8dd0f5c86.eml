Just spoke to a PE friend who agreed we're not a good PE target, but did
endorse looking at a larger raise for less - as a Series A we may be in a
better place than I'd initially though given our conversation with Bechtel.

He also suggested we look at nextjump.com - they do internal VC pitch
sessions, are pretty congruent in our space, and have a ton of money. Maybe
we should go for a visit when/if you're in NYC?
