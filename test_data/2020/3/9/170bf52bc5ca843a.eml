Steven, <br><br>I am out of the office today but I did want to touch base a=
nd address the situation. <br><br>I have tried several times to coach Josh =
through the coding on the pages. There are a few spots where Josh, has not =
followed the instructions that were provided and as a result the pages are =
not loading correctly. <br><br>He seemed like he was able to apply the fix =
to a few of the pages but for whatever reason, has not done so with all of =
the pages you need.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is as far as I am able to go=
. I am unable to go into the website and correct the errors for you, as muc=
h as I wish I could. Implementing the web pages is a DIY process- one that =
typically goes smoothly when a web developer is involved. But aside from re=
iterating where the error in the iFrame resizer =C2=A0is and highlighting w=
here to put the template links, there is not much else I am able to assist =
with. <br><br>If you=E2=80=99d like, I can send Josh the instructions on ho=
w to fix the pages again. But it=E2=80=99s up to him to apply them. <br><br=
