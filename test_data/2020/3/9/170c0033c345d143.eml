 to pass this to. Can you follow up with an email contextualizing this for =
small, medium, and large clients? I tend to work mostly with the latter and=
 some with the former, and not as often with the midsize (although that is =
a new target for me for 2020 vis a vis board seats).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt=
;<br>&gt;&gt; The difficult problem for large enterprises - and any enterpr=
ise with a large supplier network - is third party risk management: How do =
I get a basic level of assurance on the software coming into my enterprise,=
 particularly from outsourced/pro-services teams and small vendors, on a co=
ntinuos basis. As Equifax showed us, a product that=E2=80=99s green today m=
ight be red 90 days later. What if that=E2=80=99s a mobile app that your we=
b agency developed? Or a cutting-edge AI/ML capability from some venture-ba=
cked startup (none of which give a rat=E2=80=99s ass about security). <br>&=
gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How do you automate transparency on those inbound deliv=
erables (and their updates) developed outside your boundary?<br>&gt;&gt;<br=
>&gt;&gt; How do you enforce governance on a continuous basis, so that supp=
liers are on the hook to remediate/update products as vulnerabilities emerg=
e?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How does this become a tractable process for pro=
curement and vendor management, so they=E2=80=99re not saddled with cyber f=
orensics that they=E2=80=99re not staffed to take on? <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&=
gt; This is also about pushing risk to the left in contract provisions, and=
 meeting regulatory mandates for cyber responsiveness, as well as known-vul=
nerability terms of cyber insurance policies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; An e=
xample:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) The supplier deliverable (either pro ser=
vices app development or vendor product SBOM) is analyzed prior to procurem=
ent. Governance criteria are enforced. For instance, the large banks have p=
rohibited components lists - if you have certain Python libraries in your p=
roduct (containing malware, per threat intel), you=E2=80=99re not going to =
sell that product to JP Morgan Chase - it=E2=80=99s a firewall to procureme=
nt. One of the big banks requires an SBOM for full pricing - any product wi=
thout an SBOM is subject to a 40% discount if it gets procured at all.<br>&=
gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2) Ion Channel runs analysis on that SBOM every day, pa=
rallel to whatever the supplier is doing for assurance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;=
&gt; 3) If the deliverable moves from green to red (e.g. new critical vulne=
rability), that change is time-stamped. Contract provisions - security SLAs=
 - can specify how many hours/days the supplier has to push an update that =
remediates the vulnerability, and see the time stamp with third party certi=
fication that the supplier has met the provision or not, in which case ther=
e might be remedies. <br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Does =
this make sense?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; JC<br>&gt;=
&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Separately, any thinking you may h=
ave on how to propose a workable deployment with gov&#39;t would be hugely =
appreciated.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt;&gt; Josh<br>&gt;&gt=
