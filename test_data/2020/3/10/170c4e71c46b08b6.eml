We've been running some numbers and have found that even after one year of
using the platform we're seeing:

98% of participants engaged with the platform in the past month

85% of the questions asked have been answered

46% of participants have specifically interacted with their feedback over
the past month (by clicking through to a detailed feedback page or a video)

Wanted to pass these on as we were a little shocked at how well we're
doing. :)

best,
Josh
