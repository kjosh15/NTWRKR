Wanted to update you that I rewrote the iframe code your site suggests:

<iframe src="
https://www.fitmetrix.io/memberportal/register/1a72bd3e-2d44-ea11-aa59-d942907bbf75"
onload='javascript:(function(o){o.style.height=o.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+"px";}(this));'
style="height:1600px;width:100%;border:none;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>

This causes it to artificially force the height to be too long (1600px),
which resolves better than before, but height="100%" doesn't work.
Obviously we want your iframe to appear as 100% height without errors,
neither of which is a true condition at the moment. Please advise.
