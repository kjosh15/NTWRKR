Hello, and thank you for contacting FitMetrix by MINDBODY.

Sure thing!

This is not something we would be able to provide further assistance on wit=
h it solely being Developer related.=A0=A0http://fithit.com/login/ <http://=
fithit.com/login/>=A0- this page just endlessly runs an opening animation.

A test has shown this to be successful.=A0http://fithit.com/purchase/ <http=
://fithit.com/purchase/>=A0- this page appears to work now (although I have=
n't registered yet to fully test it.)

It=A0seems the resizer has been implemented incorrectly for this one. Howev=
er, we wouldn't be able to necessarily advise further on how to correct it.=
