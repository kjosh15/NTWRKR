Thanks for reaching out - you've been on my list to connect with also!

We're in a wait and see mode too. Based on what we're reading, though, it
looks likely that things will have been stabilized by then. See:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51813876

I.e., the S-curve for china stabilized in weeks (pretty much 6 weeks from
start to finish). Of course, that's in China (and reported on by Chinese
media, albeit confirmed by the WHO) so we may see a longer stretch, but
either way it's likely to have settled by summer.

In any case, we certainly can't fault you if you decide not to come, but
note that if you *did* want to come for a longer stay you could isolate
yourself at ours for the recommended two weeks and then just venture out
more broadly. Let's stay in touch as we all learn more!

All best wishes,
Josh

 I&#39;d like it to be, lol.<div>My comedy life lead me to meeting an amazi=
ng voice actor who basically told me that &quot;the weird impressions and v=
oices&quot; I do can actually make me money.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#3=
9;s very &quot;part time&quot; for me... I&#39;ve done the voice of Jesus f=
or faith based cartoons in Florida that I&#39;ve never seen, robot voices, =
and have been &quot;on hold&quot; for a bunch of narrator positions for doc=
umentaries but they never tell me why they chose the other person so I am s=
till hackin away at the craft.</div><div><br></div><div>The big=C2=A0thing =
for me has been voice doubling Schwarzenegger... it was my main impression =
for a while and in 2013 a video of me went viral and ever since, I&#39;ve b=
een doing voice overs as him for all types of projects ranging from weird p=
hone calls to a business event... all the way to voicing a live action robo=
t head on a tank that looks like him.... it&#39;s definitely been a fun rid=
e but I&#39;ve always been afraid of being completely broke as an artist so=
 I always had a day job building.</div><div><br></div><div>How did you like=
 hosting the shows? Would love to know what that was like for you?</div><di=
v>I&#39;ve always been interested in jobs like that but I find that the hos=
ts are typically a specialist along the lines of topic within the series...=
 which means I should be the host of a documentary of &quot;construction wo=
rkers that speak in weird voices to make their co-workers laugh while worki=
ng.&quot;</div></div><br><div class=3D"gmail_quote"><div dir=3D"ltr" class=
