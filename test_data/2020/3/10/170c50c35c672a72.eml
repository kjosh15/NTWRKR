My contact with them said:

"Before you talk to them or anyone, I would get crystal clear on your
business plan and what exactly is that you want. If you have a
non-confidential summary or pitch deck, I can send it to the guys in London
who do the venture stuff."

So! Want to talk more on this in a quick call later this week?
