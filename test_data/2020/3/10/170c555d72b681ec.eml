I've handed them all the research they need to identify *where* their code
is breaking down - but as I've found a workaround for everything other than
the *class schedules* page I'd start there. I'm still digging into this to
try to find a workaround, but don't have much hope: based on what I'm
seeing from console their code is failing, and they need to tell us why/how
to fix.

Note that just because I've managed to get the other pages to render
without looking like hammered shit doesn't mean all is well - we still need
to debug the problems there or they'll just pop up elsewhere later.

want to touch base and address the situation. <br><br>I have tried several =
times to coach Josh through the coding on the pages. There are a few spots =
where Josh, has not followed the instructions that were provided and as a r=

rors for you, as much as I wish I could. Implementing the web pages is a DI=
Y process- one that typically goes smoothly when a web developer is involve=
d. But aside from reiterating where the error in the iFrame resizer =C2=A0i=

I am able to assist with. <br><br>If you=E2=80=99d like, I can send Josh th=

rote:<br><br>Hey Josh, <br><br>=C2=A0<br><br>It sounds like you might have =
to create a few additional pages on the FitHit website to correspond with t=
he FitMetrix templates. So you would just create a page on the website, nam=
e it &quot;register&quot;/&quot;my account&quot; etc and then drop the ifra=
me coding there. <br><br>=C2=A0<br><br>For their instructors, I know they h=
ave an &quot;about us&quot; page they were keen on keeping as close to what=
 they currently have as possible so that page might take a little more fine=
ssing. If you have time this week we can walk through what I recommended th=
ey do for this page so it stays in line with what they&#39;ve already gotte=
n up online. <br><br>=C2=A0<br><br>Let me know when you have time for a qui=
ck 30min call and we&#39;ll knock it out together. <br><br>________________=
