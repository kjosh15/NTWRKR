I passed this on to my friend at Peppercom saying:

"We've been running some numbers and have found that even after one year of
using the platform we're seeing:

98% of participants engaged with the platform in the past month

85% of the questions asked have been answered

46% of participants have specifically interacted with their feedback over
the past month (by clicking through to a piece of detailed feedback, a
video, or an external resource.)

Wanted to pass these on as we were a little shocked at how well we're
doing. :)"

I.e., these are MIND BLOWINGLY GREAT NUMBERS. Going to verify that with my
friend Nikole, but we should be putting these in our decks stat! Do you
have anything else like this? Esp. around velocity of change, improvements
in group cohesion, updraft effects when one value improves company-wide,
etc.?

best,
Josh
