I did some more digging into the source of the errors and found a number of
javascript errors associated with your code (all pulled from javascript
console on Chrome Version 80.0.3987.122 (Official Build) (64-bit)). Please
advise on how to fix the following:

Note I've cc'd Steven and Matan so they're in the loop as we debug. This
project is now well past due and the assurances we received about customer
support and ease of install have yet to manifest. We all need a very speedy
resolution to this. Thanks!

best,
Josh

However, we wouldn't be able to necessarily advise further on how to
correct it. http://fithit.com/class-schedule/ - this page still doesn't
