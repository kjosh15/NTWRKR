Hey Josh! - Hope you guys are all well!

Just wanted to touch base about the summer - Wanted to see what you guys
were thinking for your travel plans regarding the virus.

I think if things with the virus don't turn upwards in the next couple
months I am going to cancel my travel plans for the year... don't want to
take any chances.... parents are both over 70 and not super healthy and my
lady works with kids.

Obviously I could be overthinking it - just thinking ahead is all... and
thought I should touch base/discuss it with you

-Dave
