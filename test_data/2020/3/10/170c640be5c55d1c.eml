I was able to force the MindBody code to express itself in a way that's
easier to manage, but it's causing a bunch of errors (which happen to be
resolving in a favorable way at the moment). I.e., this may be a short
terms solution, but MindBody still needs to fix their code!!

Please see https://fithit.com/class-schedule

Right now it's set to force itself to 1600px high, which should look ok on
most browsers - but in some cases (tablets, weird size screens, big
screens, etc.) it may look weird as most sites are now made to resolve
themselves to a % of the total available screen. That said, it might be
enough to get us through your launch, so take a look.

Sorry this has been such a nightmare!
