Just a heads up that I=E2=80=99ve been hearing noise about NYC gov=E2=80=99=
t locking down
the airports. Not sure if there=E2=80=99s more to it than that, but the ris=
k of
being stranded does seem to be increasing if nothing else. Still mulling
over what this means for me but figured I=E2=80=99d pass it on!

Best,
Josh
