Really liked this piece!! If it weren't peak Coronavirus I'd suggest asking
members what they think on the concept of culture and if it's the new
"killer edge" they all need to compete against (innovation now being table
stakes.) Thoughts?

Hope you're doing well out there - really very pleased to be telecommuting
now, aren't you? ;)
