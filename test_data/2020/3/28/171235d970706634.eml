This is a heavily politically slanted piece - I don=E2=80=99t expect you to e=
njoy it, but offer it as a pretty good example of the kind of thinking that p=
retty much everyone in this city would only critique from the perspective of=
 =E2=80=9Cthis is self evident, why write it out?=E2=80=9D

I send it over because it=E2=80=99s also pretty much the only POV I get regu=
larly, which makes the actions of the rest of the country particularly baffl=
ing. If you see anything like the equivalent from the conservative political=
 side, would you send it over? Without true dialogue you cannot advance your=
 thinking, and I know that each political side in this country is particular=
ly vulnerable to this right now.

Xoxo,

The President Is Trapped
Trump is utterly unsuited to deal with this crisis, either intellectually or=
 temperamentally.
