Hi Josh and Hulda,

We were wondering the same about you all. The stats in NYC look really 
scary from here.

We had gone into hermit mode on the farm about a week before the 
official lockdown started as apparently my MS puts me in the 
"vulnerable" category along with the over-70s, and there was enough 
writing on the wall that Crispin was able to make a quick swoop to 
Manchester to fetch Ani the moment her job officially moved to 
home-based.  Sheridan preferred to stay in her flat by herself, although 
I think she's at least partly regretting that now.  Rowan and Cheryl are 
holed up in their flat about 2miles out of the city centre in the 
opposite direction.  Not too much change to Rowan's work as he was "from 
home" 3 days a week in any case.

I had left an exercise bike with them just a couple of weeks before all 
this, intending to list it for sale (I have a new one).  There being 
many more buyers in a city, it wouldn't be cluttering up the place for 
long, we all thought. Obviously they are stuck with it, but Cheryl tells 
me they've been able to make good use of it, shut in with the gyms all 
closed! Unexpected plus.

We have had several days of glorious spring sunshine, and been taking 
advantage of it to be outside with the animals and work on the garden. 
It's been warm enough for me to open up the beehive and check on the 
bees, who have come through the winter well. In fact they have been so 
busy, they needed a super on the hive many weeks earlier than I would 
have expected. The skies are that special post-9/11 blue, which is 
extraordinary in itself.  Such a contrast to the news, of which all of 
us are reading far too much, too often.

Our lockdown is supposedly 3 weeks but I don't think anyone expects it 
to be that short.

Wales' press has been full of angst about second-home owners and 
daytrippers flouting lockdown rules to come to Wales as if the lockdown 
were a holiday, spreading plague and overloading local health service 
provisions while descending on the supermarkets like locusts.  Our local 
Eurospar has been quite civilised, unlike Barmouth by all accounts.  We 
have to make as few trips as possible. When Ani went yesterday (with 
disposable gloves etc) there were limits on numbers of customers in the 
store, a one-way system in place round the aisles, a barrier to stand 
behind at the checkout (long arms needed for the contactless payment 
machine!), and they had opened another door specifically to exit the 
store avoiding contact with anyone on their way in.  So far the only 
thing we've found hard to get is wholewheat bread flour.

Lyn and Robin have likewise been keeping to themselves for quite a 
while. Kind neighbours have been dropping off their shopping, on a 
rota.  Both in their village and ours, there are teams of helpers 
self-organised to help anyone in self-isolation.  I think it has 
actually done Lyn particularly a lot of good to have her busy schedule 
taken away from her.

I got Lyn to join us on our daily family meetup yesterday - her first 
time on any video chat!  She said it was "quite fun." This was Skype.  I 
would try something else, in hopes of less glitchy connections, but 
doubt I could talk Lyn into/through another piece of s/w. Skype was hard 
enough.

There is much talk here of a quick antibody test that will say if you 
have immunity, so you can get back to work.  Supposedly it's being 
produced at scale and being rolled out here (health workers first) from 
this w/e.  If so, that would be a game changer for people's lives and 
livelihoods.  I would expect it to lift the worst fears of the market as 
the economy could unfreeze, at least somewhat. Time will tell.

Do let us know how you are all doing, and the rest of the family.

Much love,
Karen
