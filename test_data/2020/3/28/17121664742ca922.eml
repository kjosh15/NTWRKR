Hey Josh, please meet my COO, Ross Porter.

Ross is a seasoned startup pro, full-stack developer, and longtime
Seattlite.

Ross, please meet Josh Klein <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Klein>,
one of the cooler people on planet earth. Josh and I were corresponding
when I was doing the Lowe's report about bringing data to bear on our built
environments.

To Josh: Ross, a capital partner, and I are building out a real estate
investment product that JVs with solid buildings and building owners and
blows out their space: optimizing layouts, thermal performance,
implementing best-practices for productivity and health, as decreed by
best-practices supported by robust datasets. We'd be rolling out a lot of
the concepts I researched for that Lowe's report. We've had the data and
tech for a while. Now is the time to start implementing.

One of the "benefits" to developer partners and investors is using data to
boost productivity and create healthier interior environments (this could
extend to the exterior). I was thinking it'd be great if you could help us
create strong arguments and possibly data to support how data/tech can
improve building performance.

Ross, Josh has done stuff with sensors and is also thinking a lot about
using our built environments as data-factories--and making sure that's a
benefit for the tenant/homeowner.

Josh, you and I will touch base Monday and go from there but I wanted to
get your mind started on the question before we spoke.

I'm stoked your stoked!

David
