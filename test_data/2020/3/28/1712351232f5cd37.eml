HI Josh!
 NIce to hear from you.
 As we are both in our eighties we are  housebound at present. We are well
and happy,  and enjoying the peace and quiet and getting lots done in the
garden. I have been doing some interesting knitting ( the strange shape in
picture one folds up to make a baby jacket ) and made a mosaic house sign.
I will attach some photos. I have painted the length of the garden wall
too, and repaired some rendering. I am getting further down the to-do list
than I ever expected!
 I expect you have been in touch with the Goswells on the farm so you will
know what they are doing. This includes regular Skype chats between
members.  Candy and her boyfriend are housebound in BRighton, which  is a
bit of a hot spot for the virus over here. HAyley and her husband Dom
similarly in Bristol. He  has asthma, so needs  to keep away from the virus
for the time being, until we have better resources to deal with it.  OUr
Prime MInister and the heir to the throne have both got it, but quite
mildly it seems.  I expect we will all get it eventually. The plan is to
keep away till there are enough ventilators and testers available, and
enough NHS staff have recovered from it to  cope with the rest.  Meanwhile
the sun is shining and the Spring is here!  The clocks go forward tonight.
We are following the guidelines and being sensible. Generally things  turn
out to be not as bad as you feared but not as good as you hoped. On
average, that is. There are always outliers, of course! Once you have done
all you can do  there is no point in worrying as it achieves nothing. It is
a question of wait and see, being patient and hoping for the best. We know
that however long it lasts, and it  may be a year, it will eventually come
to an end, and we will have a very different country at the end of it - in
some ways better, and in some worse. YOu know of the Chinese curse "May you
live in interesting times!"  well this is what they meant, I guess! HOwever
it is revealing the general goodness of so many people which is quite
inspiring.
 Stay well and safe over there, and God bless you all!
Love and hugs from
Lyn and Robin
