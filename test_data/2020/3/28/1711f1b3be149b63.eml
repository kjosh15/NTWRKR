 Indeed on the article! As for the meditation, I expect it=E2=80=99s intend=
ed as tongue-in-cheek. That sort of language pretty well conveys the feelin=
g in the streets here in the heart of the pandemic!!=C2=A0
That said, they opened up one of the streets down from us for a 7-block run=
 only to pedestrians, and it=E2=80=99s amazing to see. I ran through there =
today - glorious spring weather, all the flowers blooming - and it was abso=
lutely full of people... every single one of whom was staying equidistant f=
rom each other, and at least 6 feet apart. There were entire families of 12=
+ people, all visiting, all keeping 6 feet apart. There was an incredible s=
ense of gratitude to be alive and walking under the magnolia trees, and a r=
eal feeling of watching out for your fellow human.
So not all bad. :)
Xoxo,Josh
