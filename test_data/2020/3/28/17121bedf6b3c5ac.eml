The account we're using now (joshuaklein@gmail.com) feeds directly into my
primary email account as it's used for passwords, newsletters, etc. So we
made Othinn his own:

othinnklein@gmail.com

Can you invite that account and attach it to his existing work in google
classroom/let us pick up midway? Sorry for the trouble - REALLY not trying
to make more work for you - but this account should work much better!!

Hope you're getting some downtime on a rainy weekend,
Josh
