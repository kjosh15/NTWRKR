Indeed on the article! As for the meditation, I expect it=E2=80=99s intende=
d as
tongue-in-cheek. That sort of language pretty well conveys the feeling in
the streets here in the heart of the pandemic!!

That said, they opened up one of the streets down from us for a 7-block run
only to pedestrians, and it=E2=80=99s amazing to see. I ran through there t=
oday -
glorious spring weather, all the flowers blooming - and it was absolutely
full of people... every single one of whom was staying equidistant from
each other, and at least 6 feet apart. There were entire families of 12+
people, all visiting, all keeping 6 feet apart. There was an incredible
sense of gratitude to be alive and walking under the magnolia trees, and a
real feeling of watching out for your fellow human.

So not all bad. :)

Xoxo,
Josh
