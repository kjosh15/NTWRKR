Hey Josh -  so glad my note was helpful.   Glad to hear that you are
sticking here for now.  I would do the same thing.   It is a scary time,
but then I put it into perspective and thank "something" that it seems to
be sparing kids. I think you would see very, very different behavior if
that were the case.  Hopefully that is not the next one coming.   I stay
sane by making myself look at the overall statistics relative to global and
local population whenever I go to the really dark place in all of this.
And consciously doing stuff to stay physically healthy makes me feel a
little bit more "immune" to it all.   Re work - it is an absolutely
fascinating time on that front culturally.  The work from home model is not
exactly in our wheelhouse so you can imagine how that one is playing out.
I will absolutely let you know if there is any way to contribute.
Constraint breeds innovation.  The global model of engagement and value
creation will never be the same after all of this.  Imagine if the scenario
we are in now was driven by a cataclysmic climate change? What does social
distancing look like in that scenario?
With that said...you mentioned your challenge with the speaking gigs--I
have a friend who is running a very innovative company what connects expert
speakers with customers in a very unique way.   1. They time slice things
remotely - meaning you want Bill Gates to speak to your group?  Fine--you
can buy 10 minutes of his time while he is sitting at his kitchen table.
The logistics and cost are slashed.  He also has a hologram capability
where they are experimenting with beaming people in to stages remotely -
and in both cases IT'S ALL INTERACTIVE.    The tech is cool but the real
magic is the global network of experts and the platform he has.  I can
reach out and do an introduction and see if he can add you to the network
of experts called upon to speak as needed.   I can only imagine how his
business is doing right now.   The company is called Geniecast.  Send me a
paragraph/bio I can use if you want me to reach out.

Best,
Rachel

and culture of decision-making under stress in Iceland vs. America.=C2=A0 <=
br></div><div><br></div><div>As for your question about &quot;wait this out=
 there&quot; - to me that means both the wave happening now (short term) AN=
D the one coming in the fall/winter which is expected to be far more hellis=
h than what is currently occurring.=C2=A0 I think &quot;wait this out&quot;=
 means 18 months. In that scenario - I&#39;d want to know where the US stan=
ds on getting enough testing kits and testing infrastructure in place by th=
e Fall and where the first vaccines will be available.=C2=A0 If you go to I=
celand - I would personally go with the mindset of being there for at least=
 a year.=C2=A0 That said, you are comparing NYC to Iceland.=C2=A0 You don&#=
39;t have to live in NYC.=C2=A0 A house/apartment in a low-population densi=
ty state with a major hospital nearby might meet the conditions you are thi=
nking you might get in Iceland.=C2=A0 <br></div><div><br></div><div>There a=
re so many variables downstream of the whole situation that we can&#39;t &q=
uot;game&quot; out. Don&#39;t let those over-complicate how you think throu=
gh this.=C2=A0 You can control your physical world right now - where can yo=
u create the best physical conditions to avoid/delay getting sick?=C2=A0 Pe=
rsonally, once I check the box on that one, the anxiety and &quot;gaming&qu=
ot; goes WAY down.=C2=A0 One orthogonal benefit is that it will keep your m=
ental space positive to think through the GAZILLION fascinating business op=
portunities around &quot;culture&quot; that will likely be ripe for busines=
s development as a result of all this. And that too may help drive your lon=
g term decision about where you want to be. =C2=A0 Hope that helps a bit.=
