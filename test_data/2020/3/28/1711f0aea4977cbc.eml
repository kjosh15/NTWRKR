How wonderful.... the run and vista. Sounds like a great community. Not so
bad at all.

I knew the mediation was tongue-in-cheek. Every time he'd say one of the
B___s___ words, a laugh would just bubble out of me.... really, I couldn't
stop it.

So, it looks like you live fairly close to the Elmhurst Hospital.  Yes?
Then as i remember your blocks are pretty long blocks. Did make me gulp a
little looking at the map.

Really Love you guys,

Sharon
