Just as an aside I wanted to mention how grateful we are for the work
you=E2=80=99re doing - suddenly having to support a bunch of kids learning =
from
home has got to be a huge stressor and we cannot thank you enough for any
support. You=E2=80=99re doing an amazing job keeping us informed and calm; =
thank
you!!
