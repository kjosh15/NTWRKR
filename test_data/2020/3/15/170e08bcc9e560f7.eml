Dear Families,

     I hope this message finds you well.  As you have probably heard, Mayor
De Blasio has announced a long-term school closure.  Schools will be closed
starting tomorrow through spring break, with a tentative start date of
April 20.  While it is sad news, safety and health are a priority.

    As an early childhood teacher, I never thought I would encounter a
situation like this.  So much of what we do at school includes
collaboration, investigation, and discussion, as well as direct
instruction.  Those interactions are what I love most about teaching, and
what kids love about coming to school each day.

     I spent some time this weekend assembling resources for home learning
in preparation for families who were choosing to stay home, but I have been
asked to hold off on sending resources for now, as a large-scale plan to
implement remote learning is put in place by the Department of Education.
Last week=E2=80=99s newsletter offered some suggestions for math games and =
websites
if you are interested.

     I will be spending Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday learning more
about what this means and how it will look in the coming weeks of the
school year.  =E2=80=9CRemote Digital Learning=E2=80=9D will begin Monday, =
March 23. Beyond
that, I know very little about what=E2=80=99s to come, but I will be sure t=
o keep
you all posted as I know more.

     In the meantime... read, write (poems), cook, do art projects,
practice math facts, conduct simple science experiments, play board games
and math games, practice sight words, draw, build, or do cardboard
construction.  If you=E2=80=99d like, send me a photo I will post to the Ho=
meroom
app to share with other students.

     Lastly, I=E2=80=99ll just say that I will miss our kids!  Please do no=
t
hesitate to reach out this week. If you want to send a piece of writing, or
share something they did, or even jump on FaceTime for a few minutes to say
=E2=80=9CHi,=E2=80=9D let me know!  It is surely very unnerving to be a six=
 or seven year
old and have your schedule and routine change completely (due to, of all
things, a global pandemic). We want to maintain as much consistency as
possible.

     I=E2=80=99ve included a letter to kids.  Every day at school, our day =
begins
with a morning message.  This is my =E2=80=9Cevening message=E2=80=9D to ki=
ds today.

Thinking of you all,

Eleanor


Sunday, March 15, 2020

Dear First Graders,

     We found out tonight that we will not have school for many days to
come.  It was very surprising and sad news for us. We are going to miss you
all so much!

     Soon, teachers will be working on sending work to you so you can
practice writing, reading, and math at home.

     For now, we hope you=E2=80=99ll do projects and play games, but also d=
o lots
of reading and maybe even write some poems.  If you write a poem, will you
please have your grown-up send it to us so we can read it? We love reading
your wonderful poetry!

Love,

Eleanor, Nita, and Shawna
