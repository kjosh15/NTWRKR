Can you connect us with whomever gave you the advice on your lease? We're
waiting for our latest rental history, but know that previously it listed
the rent stabilization as just dissapearing, with no gap in tentant nor
notable increase in rent. If possible, I'd like to put in my paperwork at
the same time as yours to improve our chances, but want some advice on if
that's the right action first.

Thanks so much!!
- J
