Let's talk about item #3 tomorrow; I think it's slightly more nuanced and
less of a lift. Again, in looking at competitors I think we have a lot to
reference as distinguishing ourselves, and also that there is increasing
commonality in context for people to understand what we do as different.

For #2 I'll bring it up at a later date; I want Big Spaceship invested in
using the platform for its own value first. Or do you think it's a big
enough return to push up front?

Reg #1 looking forward to it!
