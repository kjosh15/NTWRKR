Holy crap that video is nauseatingly targeted - love the old white guy CEO,
slightly awkward young intern, and porkpie-wearing CMO! Some really good
lessons there, though, which echo what I've been hearing elsewhere: HR
heads don't know what to ask, can't build their own campaigns, and don't
know how to make change.

Makes me realize (again) that our approach is really unique: the only
custom pieces are the questions for the values, but after that we support
WHATEVER you want to try with validated data. We've built a framework for
managing and growing your company culture, with statistical evidence every
step of the way, no matter what you want to improve.

A couple points:

Why do we talk about Jeff's former managers? What's the point of this
paragraph as part of the total narrative?

Was the predictable situation Jeff found himself in that he was doing well
on hard skill KPIs, but wasn't fitting into the company? I.e., are we
highlighting that the problem in the past was soft skill cohesion (which
Indigo then helps with)?

I made a gdoc of this script and did a rewrite and will invite you in a
moment. Let me know what you think!
