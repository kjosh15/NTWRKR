Still working on that - in the meantime, I've been pointed at this generic
role:
https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/78968426879427270-product-manager/

If you apply for that, it puts you into a general PM pool which should work
a lot better! I see you said you can reapply on March 4th, which is soon.
:-)

On cookware, I've been musing about a carbon steel pan.
