This is HUGELY helpful (especially as I'm talking to another person at
LinkedIn tomorrow). Occurs to me that we could do a spreadsheet of the
other major competitors in this space in order to draw out EXACTLY how
Indigo differs. For example, if across the board IndigoMetric allows
companies to drive to company-specific values and behaviors as opposed
stock, predesigned ones) and gives automatically-generated peer-to-peer
feedback for individuals (as opposed to only pulling that data upwards) as
new features, we should really be doubling down on those elements as
industry distinguishing differences.
