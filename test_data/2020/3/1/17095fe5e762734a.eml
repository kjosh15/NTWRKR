Don't know that we need to belabor this point in the article (although will
include this reference) as we're more focused on what we can do
proactively. Think we need to really deliver on some takeaways that we've
learned in building IndigoMetrics more generally... while building
confidence in our expertise in this platform.

Am really thinking that Indigo stands out in terms of the peer-to-peer
analysis and ubiquity of feedback (to allow for cohesive, company-wide
uplift).
