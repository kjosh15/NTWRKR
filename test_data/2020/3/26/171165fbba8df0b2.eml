On Big Spaceship still think we need to think about how we are solving =
their problems with our JV =E2=80=93 other than just giving them =
something to sell. Think the challenge with Rivel is that Inclign =
doesn=E2=80=99t really play to their strengths =E2=80=93 its just =
another thing to sell because they have senior people=E2=80=99s ears. So =
if possible think its important to weave their expertise into what we =
are offering. So if we are focussing on managing culture through this =
remote working period =E2=80=93 how can big spaceship help with that? =
Its cool content around the host=E2=80=99s culture that can be =
disseminated and then tested via Indigo?

1. Big Spaceship. I'm mostly just concerned with them getting us into =
and through sales. Making training content can happen later, as I think =
the immediate benefit to companies is insight into who/where there are =
collaboration issues. (See below).

=20

2. Lane 4. I think maintaining and growing culture is a fine pitch given =
that everyone is remote - i.e., the immediate threat is that your =
culture is going to go sideways because you have no visibility. Indigo =
gives you that visibility (plus a lot more) and ability to control, with =
the option to scale that control algorithmically over time. Given the =
crisis I really think that *just* visibility alone is going to be enough =
to get people signed on.

=20

Which pushes for how we distinguish ourselves from competitors. I.e., =
why us instead of Glint or anyone else? We really need an =
apples-to-apples feature list comparison that shows how critical Indigo =
is to the remote work challenge specifically.

=20

Thoughts?

I left my call with Lane 4 yesterday being less certain than I was on =
the way in as to what a good =E2=80=9Cstandard=E2=80=9D product with =
Lane 4 would look like, think the problem is I was thinking we would be =
solving 2 problems:

=20

*	Teach and embed the different set of soft skills that are required =
when remote working compared to office working
*	Maintaining and growing culture when staff are away from the office =
during a stressful time of change

=20

Problem is Lane 4 don=E2=80=99t have a remote working behavioural model =
=E2=80=93 and they don=E2=80=99t seem to think that soft skills for =
working remotely are much different from office work =E2=80=93 and they =
are probably right. Plus answering 2 questions is always complicated.

=20

So maybe we should concentrate on the maintain and grow culture piece =
=E2=80=93 and take the risk that having to adapt existing value sets =
into bespoke action statements will slow us down?

For discussion in next call!

He=E2=80=99s definitely interested - we kicked off the call with my =
asking him about where his org is at, and he=E2=80=99s very confident =
about their long term survivability if unhappy about the short-term =
costs (JetBlue is one of their biggest clients). One key quote: =
=E2=80=9Cthe companies that survive this are the ones that beat manage =
their cash flow, but that includes building new revenue streams for the =
future.=E2=80=9D

=20

Two points:

=20

1. He has been speaking with someone who does enterprise software sales =
at a big company about how to work with them. He=E2=80=99s going to talk =
with them about how/if they could help beyond the brand/messaging piece.

=20

2. He=E2=80=99s going to talk to his executive team about how they could =
handle the brand/messaging piece for us regardless of (1).

=20

Again, I offered that we white label this through big spaceship and =
split the revenue, whatever that looks like (knowing that we could offer =
it to W59 for free for three months, or at a discount, or or or). I also =
explained that we had two offerings; a canon of values most companies =
had modified for remote work (I.e., a standard indigo instance) or a =
remote work value set anyone could just drop in. Finally, I reinforced =
that we=E2=80=99re the only ones in this space that can measure =
arbitrary values and also measure peer-to-peer relationships around said =
values.=20

=20

Oh, and your discovery about our numbers going up in use by remote =
workers was gold. :)

=20

He=E2=80=99s going to talk to his contact tomorrow afternoon and get =
back to me ASAP - I made it clear W50 is pushing me for talking points =
and really want a podcast from me.

=20

Oh, and simultaneously I=E2=80=99m pushing CNBC to take a video piece =
from me on this same topic - not immediately, I know ... but =
it=E2=80=99ll be worth something for them soon enough!=20

=20

Looking forward to more tequila,

Josh

a fine pitch given that everyone is remote - i.e., the immediate threat =
is that your culture is going to go sideways because you have no =
visibility. Indigo gives you that visibility (plus a lot more) and =
ability to control, with the option to scale that control =
algorithmically over time. Given the crisis I really think that *just* =
visibility alone is going to be enough to get people signed =
on.<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p =
