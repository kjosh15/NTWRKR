Hey Team Co!

Here's my thinking on how to deal with the pandemic short-term:

# Strategy:

1) We are buying time until we get:

- antibody tests that can show we've developed immunity
- an antiviral that drastically reduces the mortality risk
- a vaccine

Until then our goal should be to be as protected as possible from infection
(I.e., presume you're not infected until proven otherwise) to mitigate the
number of dead parents on the team.


2) We can control our behavior in quarantine, wherever we are. What we are
not controlling right now is our environment (ambient risk):

- Jackson Heights has the highest rate of infection and death in the USA at
the moment
- Our medical system is currently collapsing and is likely to stay
collapsed for 4-8 weeks (1) at least.
- People are going to do stupid things around us as they attempt to cope
with this; we've seen two car accidents within a block of our respective
homes in the last two days.

Consider that hypertension has an associated 6% mortality risk. Diabetes
has 7% (I=E2=80=99m not diabetic but had prediabetes.)


3) If the above is true, then we should seek to control our environment to
minimize exposure until one of the conditions in (1), above, is true.


# Good news:

- NYC is first in line to get new supplies, so it will likely be the first
to get widespread access to antibody testing.
- Because it was first, NYC may be able to recover its medical services
faster than expected.
- We can all work remote, and our kids all get on well together and seem to
be flourishing with remote school.
- As of Sunday the projection was that hospitalizations would double every
two days. But on Tuesday doubling was expected every 4.7 days. So social
distancing is working to slow the spread.
- We're responsible, caring people who can actually self-quarantine if we
choose to, wherever we are.


# Proposal:

There are many AirBnB's outside of NYC on farms and ranches were we could
self-isolate for two weeks and let the kids run free. We'd have to find
some place with decent medical care nearby (and hopefully Amazon Fresh
delivery!!)

This puts us in a place of minimum risk to wait for one of the above
desired conditions.


# Thinking with the heart:

This isn't my speciality, but I'll throw in my $0.02 in an anecdote that
summarizes my feelings. Last night we lay in bed and listened to ambulance
after ambulance stop outside our apartment. Last night we heard three. At
the current trajectory, by the peak we would have between 96 and and 768
per night (depending on if it peaks in two or thee weeks).

The emotional environment is going to affect our children. A lot of people
are dying around us, and everyone is afraid. Even if we're able to protect
them from physical harm these kids might sleep better going forward if they
had a couple of weeks in the countryside to remote school apart from it all=
.


Let me know what you all think!
- J



(1) If you presume equal amplitude on the rise and fall of cases, and we're
three weeks out from peak, then we will have at least a month and a half
until it's as sane as it is now.
