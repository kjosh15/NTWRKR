<br><br>Thanks again for the second conversation; seems like lots of connec=
tions here!<br><br>One of the questions you had was about the type of work =
I did for IDEO. Obviously I can&#39;t discuss anything not publicly known a=
bout IDEO, their business, processes, clients, etc. etc. but I&#39;m happy =
to outline the type of strategy work I&#39;ve done in the past inasmuch as =
it pertains to the kind of work I could help BigSpaceship with. <br><br>Spe=
cifically, this type of strategy work has often involved:<br><br>	- conduct=
ing one-on-one interviews with stakeholders across all offices to understan=
d the business prerogatives, assets, and opportunities.<br>	- Conducting ex=
pert interviews with external clients, potential clients, area experts, and=
 competitors.<br>	- Synthesised these interviews through a strategic framew=
ork either native to the client (such as IDEO&#39;s Play To Win approach) o=
r external as best fits the needs of the client.<br>	- Expand the strategic=
 recommendation to areas of immediate impact<br>	- Draw out those areas to =
detail processes, key KPIs with initial tests for validation, and anticipat=
ed outcomes with paired response strategies.<br>	- Create a timeline for te=
st execution, evaluation/validation, and revision.<br>	- Indexes of all wor=
king material for later analysis and reference, the formal strategy process=
, example content (if any are related), detailed deliverables descriptions =
and requirements, and any additional value-add insights otherwise outside o=
f the strategic approach.<br><br>Put in human-speak, I dig deeply into the =
company, detail all the opportunities and problems that pertain to the proj=
ect goal, use a formal strategic method to force rigor in shaping a recomme=
ndation, and then detail that recommendation into a series of actionable te=
sts that can be used to validate progress towards the recommended goal(s). =
<br><br>That&#39;s one type of project I&#39;ve really enjoyed in the past,=
 and have done variations for several organizations. Outside of that, and b=
ased on what I know of Big Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I&#39;ve also d=
one a lot of:<br><br>	- Technology advising. I&#39;ve helped shape the tech=
nological approach for literally hundreds of projects, processes, companies=
, startups, R&amp;D divisions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is =
not in outlining code structures or hacking together prototypes, but in art=
iculating the value proposition for the client and identifying strategic op=
portunities from a diverse set of technologies and business elements to cre=
ate results that are more than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic in=
novation consulting; this is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39;s clients tha=
t underwrote my strategy work. <br><br>	- Managing clients and creating par=
tnerships. One of the weird side effects of being an executive-whisperer is=
 that I&#39;ve got a unique perspective on the global market, the ways that=
 emerging technologies can be harnessed, and where otherwise obtuse partner=
ships could make great sense. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV inter=
views, articles, books, radio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a mo=
re complete list at <a href=3D"http://josh.is/writing/" target=3D"_blank">j=
osh.is/writing/</a><br><br>	- Program development. I&#39;ve built the Trust=
 Model for Consumer reports, an incubator for IMAX, a social good platform =
for the CMO of Coke, etc.<br><br>Finally, I also think I could do well at B=
usiness Development. Because I&#39;ve spent nearly two decades freelancing =
in NY and globally, and because for the last decade that&#39;s been almost =
exclusively and directly to senior executives of major multinationals, I&#3=
9;ve got an excellent and unusual network. While I&#39;ve used this network=
 to secure funding for startups, to cross-sell solutions from same, and to =
develop project partnerships, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusively. But I thin=
k I could do a pretty good job of it.<br><br>Let me know if any of this is =
food for thought. I hear you that we&#39;d need to find a client project to=
 attach to, but I&#39;m hopeful we can find something that would work colla=
boratively to help build other initiatives. Happy to discuss any of the abo=
ve further in a call or f2f!<br><br>best,<br>Josh=C2=A0<br></div><div hspac=
