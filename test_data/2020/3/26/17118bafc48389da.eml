I hear you on all this. And yes to the opportunity for your startup if
companies get it. Have you already identified your buyer? As in their role
at the companies? Is it a learning + development person, CIO, etc.?

Also! That future of work of project is up in the air but I got a little
green light to do some expert interviews, since they don't know what
they're doing anyways yet. It would be an hour with me by phone in the
coming days, and I'd have the team mail you a $300 visa gift card. Want to
be one of my "experts"?
