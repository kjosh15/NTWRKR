Yessiree. First, the usual: Count fingrs and toes, one in middle of 
face, et cetera. Second,is your mother okay and the look on her face - 
there was a feeling there that I will never know, not being a mother.  
It just looked like the purest look of love I will ever see.

Devon didn't talk very much as a young child, but you "interpreted" for 
her. She was quiet but stubborn. I recall one time when she was small 
and your mother told her she could or couldn't do something. Your mother 
finished  and indicated "that was a done deal" and I watched Devon and 
thought, "she's not buying any of that".
>
> What were the hardest moments you had when I was growing up?
>
When your mother hemorrhaged just after you were born and, when you were 
young, trying to get you interested in the outdoors. While I miss not 
having had the outdoor experiences I had hoped we would share, you 
eventually found interest in the outdoors (I assume, at least in part 
due to the exposure we gave you), for which I am very pleased.
>

No. Look at who you've become, how well respected you seem to be 
professionally and what a wonderful family you are. What - that would be

You and Hulda are doing it, and doing it superbly well. We are in awe of 
your wonderful family.

>

I think you know the story; Your mother was tired of going through boy 
friends and I was enjoying life too much to get serious with a woman. 
Your mother joined her folks at a wine conference that I was working at. 
I knew your (maternal) grandfather professionally and, during the 
conference, he introduced his daughter (your mother) to me.
>
> Are you proud of me?
>
More than you will ever realize!
>
> What were your parents like?
>
Loving, kind, gentle and giving. My father was quiet and family came 
first. My mother was outgoing, boisterous and, I think, never met 
someone she couldn't like or befriend or help or all of the aforementioned.
>
> How was your relationship with your parents?
>
Excellent. I loved my family and - beginning to end - felt loved by 
them. My father was the one who took me and my friend(s) fishing or 
hunting or ... I couldn't understand how other fathers didn't do the 
same - it truly seemed strange to me because it was such a natural part 
of my family. My mother - it seemed to me - was clairvoyant. She seemed 
to know what I was going to do before I did. While I was very shy as a 
child, she would push - gently push - me beyond my comfort zone.
>
> How would you describe yourself as a child? Were you happy?
>
I would describe myself as a child as very happy.
>
> What is your best memory of childhood? Worst?
>
There were so many good times it would be hard to pick even a few as 
"best". I remember when my parents confirmed/learned that I was going to 
have a sister, I remember catching my first fish (on Shelter Island), I 
remember my father asking me to tell my date for the evening that he and 
my mother wanted us all to go to dinner (in a nice restaurant - we never 
knew what fast food was) and I remember Jill and me telling my mother we 
wanted to tkae our dates home, it was late and we were too tired to 
teach her whatever the current popular dance was. Those are a few examples.

The worst was when the detectives came to the door to arrest me - but 
that is a story for another time.

Well, there are a few tidbits to chew on. I probably raised more 
questions than I answered.

I love, respect and admire you.

DAD

    I would describe myself as a child as very happy.<br>

    <p>There were so many good times it would be hard to pick even a few
      as "best". I remember when my parents confirmed/learned that I was
      going to have a sister, I remember catching my first fish (on
      Shelter Island), I remember my father asking me to tell my date
      for the evening that he and my mother wanted us all to go to
      dinner (in a nice restaurant - we never knew what fast food was)
      and I remember Jill and me telling my mother we wanted to tkae our
      dates home, it was late and we were too tired to teach her
      whatever the current popular dance was. Those are a few examples.</p>
    <p>The worst was when the detectives came to the door to arrest me -
      but that is a story for another time.</p>
    <p>Well, there are a few tidbits to chew on. I probably raised more
      questions than I answered.</p>
    <p>I love, respect and admire you.</p>
