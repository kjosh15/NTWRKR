Sweets,

Thanks for asking for this!! Below is a short one-liner for each serious
opportunity I see in front of me. Some of these are likely to drop off
(Normative), some aren't good fits (BP), and some of them are very long
timelines (Apple, Google, HP). A couple aren't particularly exciting but
could be lucrative (Korn Ferry, Halma), and a couple are actually kind of
exciting (Abbot, New Lab)!

Let me know what about this format works or doesn't work and what other
information you'd like to see and I'll try to make a readout like this a
habit so we can keep an eye on each other's efforts.

oxoxo,
Josh

######

Abbot: FT, next step is to talk to internal recruiter about a specific
project the CTO and I have discussed. I feel really confident about my
pitch, but who knows if they'll bite.

HP: Waiting to be introduced to SVP in innovation group.

Halma: Discussed specific advisory role, waiting to see what their pool of
experts surfaces in terms of competition. Would likely be part time-ish.

New Lab: Qualified retainer gig to bring in new partners. Waiting for deck
of data and will then pitch who I could connect with.

BP: Waiting to review their portfolio to see if I could be a CEO for one.
Not specifically excited about this and don't know that I would qualify.

Normative: Business Development for a dev team in Toronto. Talking to team
tomorrow, expect they'll close this down in response to virus affected
market.

Korn Ferry: Am being pitched to manage new HR effort for big pharma company
in Boston.

Google: Waiting for recruiters to start putting me through their process.
Likely to take a long time.

Apple: Waiting for followup call w/ recruiter to talk to someone more
senior to start going through their recruitment process. Likely to take a
long time.
