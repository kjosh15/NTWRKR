Good to talk with you earlier today - really exciting to hear about the
format you've been working on, and the Verizon opp especially! Send me your
basic deck and anything more specific to the 5G lab and I'll revert with
some thinking about who I'd want to approach in terms of clients.

All best,
Josh
