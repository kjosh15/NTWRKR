Things here are very eerie. There is almost no car traffic aside from
ambulances, of which you hear more and more every day. Based on the
predicted curve we expect to be hearing them constantly by next week.

The balance we're straddling is between fleeing to Iceland, where they are
much more resource constrained (especially mid- to long-term) vs. staying
in the heart of the pandemic, where the most resources are currently being
assigned. I.e., which place will be best able to support us when/if we need
care... or food.

The biggest emotional hurdle is that the kids are loving home schooling
with another family we've formed a cell with and seem to be flourishing in
the new environment. Pulling them out to Iceland and into a two week
quarantine with an uncertain return date would be very hard for them.
Outside of that is the very good chance that we're all already infected and
out the other side (we've been isolated for two weeks with no symptoms), in
which case being nearest the antibody tests when they finally arrive would
be a great boon. Again, I know that's not a logical reason - any increased
% chance of death should be rejected - but it remains.

The silver lining is that the crisis has rekindled an interest in
innovation - most companies are keenly aware that they need to plan for the
future in addition to defending against the present, and on all the W50
calls I'm attending you can tell executives know there is a finite timeline
on the pandemic. My startup, which models culture using peer-to-peer
evaluation, is making a hard pivot towards the remote worker opportunity,
so that's exciting as well.

I'd be curious if you see an avenue towards exploiting this "new reality"
planning window for your next gig. I've been pushing Abbott, the continuous
glucose monitor manufacturer, for example, to take advantage of the
pandemic to hire me to explore fast-tracking studies around the use of
their platform for non-insulin using diabetics en route to making them
available to prediabetics. Exciting stuff!

Keep safe,
Josh
