How did your call go yesterday?

Something else to add; we=E2=80=99ve been working in the UK with using shor=
t video
clips of leaders to address areas of weaker values. I.e., having the CFO
talk about =E2=80=9Caccountability=E2=80=9D in a human way for 2m so those =
who are lagging
in that area can get a better shared understanding of what that value
means.

It=E2=80=99s essentially an internal advertising campaign with an aim to sh=
ifting
culture. Most L&D companies are aimed at =E2=80=9Cupskilling,=E2=80=9D wher=
eas this is
actually more an enculturation effort. We thought it might be a new
capability that Big Spaceship could do really well.

Hit me with an update - we need to move relatively quickly to get
everything in order with World 50, etc. Oh! And I=E2=80=99ve been asked to =
do a
SXSW virtual presentation and potentially a virtual talk for Singularity U,
so other channels are popping up.

ased on what I know of Big Spaceship&#39;s business so far, I&#39;ve also d=
one a lot of:<br><br>	- Technology advising. I&#39;ve helped shape the tech=
nological approach for literally hundreds of projects, processes, companies=
, startups, R&amp;D divisions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is =
not in outlining code structures or hacking together prototypes, but in art=
iculating the value proposition for the client and identifying strategic op=
portunities from a diverse set of technologies and business elements to cre=
ate results that are more than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic in=
novation consulting; this is a lot of what I did for IDEO&#39;s clients tha=
t underwrote my strategy work. <br><br>	- Managing clients and creating par=
tnerships. One of the weird side effects of being an executive-whisperer is=
 that I&#39;ve got a unique perspective on the global market, the ways that=
 emerging technologies can be harnessed, and where otherwise obtuse partner=
ships could make great sense. <br><br>	- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV inter=
views, articles, books, radio interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a mo=
re complete list at <a href=3D"http://josh.is/writing/" target=3D"_blank">j=
osh.is/writing/</a><br><br>	- Program development. I&#39;ve built the Trust=
 Model for Consumer reports, an incubator for IMAX, a social good platform =
for the CMO of Coke, etc.<br><br>Finally, I also think I could do well at B=
usiness Development. Because I&#39;ve spent nearly two decades freelancing =
in NY and globally, and because for the last decade that&#39;s been almost =
exclusively and directly to senior executives of major multinationals, I&#3=
9;ve got an excellent and unusual network. While I&#39;ve used this network=
 to secure funding for startups, to cross-sell solutions from same, and to =
develop project partnerships, I haven&#39;t done BD exclusively. But I thin=
k I could do a pretty good job of it.<br><br>Let me know if any of this is =
food for thought. I hear you that we&#39;d need to find a client project to=
 attach to, but I&#39;m hopeful we can find something that would work colla=
boratively to help build other initiatives. Happy to discuss any of the abo=
ve further in a call or f2f!<br><br>best,<br>Josh=C2=A0<br></div><div hspac=
