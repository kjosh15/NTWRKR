Stephanie,

First, I hope you and yours are safe and healthy!!

Secondly, I'm scanning in any physical docs I have for you and aim aiming
to get everything else to you by early next week. In the meantime, do you
have any insight into when/what should we anticipate paying going forward?

Many thanks!
Josh
