Abraham,

Right now it looks like we have enough cash on hand to get us through to
when the first tranche of the estate money arrives, which should get us
through until the second tranche arrives, which ought to get us through
until I've signed a contract and the first paycheck arrives. We hope!

In the meantime, our primary credit card is just about maxed out ($15k of
$20k total). Of the three options we have available (1. Opening a solo 401k
and than taking a loan, 2. a 60-day rollover from our IRA, or 3. Asking my
folks for a short term loan) what do you recommend, and where would you put
said funds first?

Thanks much,
Josh
