We don't have an invite in place yet (for videolinking everyone in) but it
would be March 25 at 2:30pm EST. Does that work for you?

In terms of objectives, AFAIK they have *nothing* like what you're offering
in place, and off the record are suffering from the usual large
conglomerate problem of numerous legacy systems, several "enterprise level"
software deployments to establish data access, and a bunch of smaller
projects individuals are putting in place just to get their jobs done. From
an IT perspective it's a sprawling nightmare that's impossible to secure,
so I'd say you're in a pretty sweet spot to sell in your solution if you
can position it as providing assurances cross-company. Happy to provide
more color if that helps!

In the meantime, let me know what else I can do to upskill them before the
call. They've reviewed your deck and I've told them at a high level why/how
I think they could play a role, but I'm happy to feed them more information
prior to the call if you can think of a way to do so that's useful.

best,
Josh
