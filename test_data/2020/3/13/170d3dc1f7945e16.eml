First, here's hoping you and yours are all well and healthy. We just had a
state of emergency declared, so are catching up to WA in several ways.

Separately, pursuant this thread, do you have a master list of information
material (digital and/or otherwise) you keep on hand? Was thinking that
we're likely to continue to have electricity, water, etc. going forward,
but if internet or any of the above were to drop out we'd want to have
information most of all. I just got some of the Hesperian docs, but was
curious what else you're stockpiling!

All best wishes,
Josh
