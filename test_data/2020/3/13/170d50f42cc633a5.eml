Let's discuss (or just tell me yes/no) but my suggestion is:

- sign the lease extension now
- fill in the JustFix doc of everything that needs to be fixed in our apt.
(it will go in certified mail and be a record of how long until they do
anything)
- research if we're rent stabilized
(I've filed for a updated rent history, and we can contact Sandra & Noah
for advice/connections/etc.)

Sound good? Given the virus I'm guessing we're going to be in a pretty
strong position to negotiate in Oct., esp. if we have a documented record
of all the stuff they haven't done to repair our apt.

xoxo,
Josh
