 If you have a plain-language summary at the very top of the document that'l=
l facilitate its being easy to approve by whomever we get in contact with up=
stream within their org. Keep in mind, the customer was spooked given the ma=
rket prior to Covid-19, so despite knowing intuitively that this is a critic=
al investment you can make it easier with language targeted at a 7-year-old.=
