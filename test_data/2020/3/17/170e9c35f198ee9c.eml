Abraham,=0A=0AWanted to get your eye on our current status to see=
 if I'm missing anything and to help me think through next steps;=
 given where things are at with the coronavirus I'd love to get y=
our advice! =0A=0A# What we have=0A=0ARight now we have =0A=0A	$8=

I'll get employed eventually, but given the coronavirus every pot=
