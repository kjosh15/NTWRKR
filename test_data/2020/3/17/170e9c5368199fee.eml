Totally separately, I just sent this via the site so it wouldn't be sent in
the clear over email. Seeing it sent back to me via email is a total
non-win. Something to note for after the virus!

Wanted to get your eye on our current status to see if I&#39;m missing anyt=

# What we have<br>
<br>
Right now we have <br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 $8k in personal checking<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 $3k in business account (but will pay a $15.00/=
month fee below $2k)<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -$17k personal credit card (with an 15.4% APR a=
nd a max of $20k)<br>
<br>
# What we spend<br>
<br>
We have some regular expenses that are automatically scheduled (primarily h=
ealth care, child care, and rent):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Last week of every month: $~4k=C2=A0 <br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Middle of every month: $~2k<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Total: ~$6k scheduled<br>
<br>
We also spend about $4-6k in cash and credit card per month (mostly on groc=
eries.)<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Total: $10-12k/month<br>
<br>
<br>
# What income is coming<br>
<br>
*IF* the courts approve the early dispersal of the estate funds we should g=
et <br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 $25,000 April<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 $33,000 June<br>
<br>
# Options<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Get a 0% APY card and move our credit card debt=
 over<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Get a short term $20k loan to cover the CC (ave=
rage 10% interest, better than CC rate)<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Ask for a credit card hardship plan<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Do a Solo 401k (we&#39;re waiting to hear from =
Vanguard about this)<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Do a 60-day rollover from our IRA<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Ask my parents for ~$10k (they would have to se=
ll stock to do it, which is really terrible given the market atm)<br>
<br>
Note: I called the bank today and they offered to wave the minimum balance =
fee for one month - but no hardship plan offer. <br>
<br>
# Next steps<br>
<br>
Bringing down the credit card seems like our biggest goal right now, along =
with making sure we have enough $$ to keep the lights on and food on the ta=
ble. <br>
<br>
We&#39;re doing our best to lower expenses, but unfortunately most of them =
are food.<br>
<br>
We will have some income, but it looks likely we&#39;ll have to spend it im=
mediately and try to recover to pay the tax on it later.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll get employed eventually, but given the coronavirus every potential=
 employer is currently on lockdown.<br>
<br>
Can we push back on rent, or health care or child care given the virus? Are=
 there any aid packages to defer interest on short-term loans? <br>
<br>
We have some options, but I&#39;m not clear on where to start. When should =
we move what from where? Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
Much obliged, <br>
Josh<br>
