Today's call was AMAZING. You guys are absolutely killing it in providing 
value for your members during this time of crisis.

I got some follow up inquiries indicating that there's a real appetite for 
discussion around how to manage non-hourly workforces that are shifting to 
remote work. My last book (Reputation Economics), my startup platform 
(IndigoMetrics), and my advisory work (Shortlist.co, Venture.co) are all 
oriented around formerly nontraditional ways of working. 

If I can be of any help in 1-on-1 discussions with W50 members around how 
to manage this shift, I'd be happy to: right now is a huge opportunity to 
set new standards that can lift your company ahead of the competition, and 
there are a lot of basic steps that can start the process off right.

I hope you and yours are safe and sane - keep washing those hands!

All best,
Josh
