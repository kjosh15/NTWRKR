Yes, that's it!!! "Quantification of soft skills is more important to
remote workers than office workers." Is there anything we can pull out
about the speed with which improvements CAN happen for remote vs office
workers? I.e., can we position Indigo along some of these vectors?

1. If you're moving a bunch of workers to virtual, IndigoMetrics can help
you with the transition
2. If you're moving a bunch of workers to virtual, now is the time to get
them used to new, more powerful KPIs (IndigoMetrics)
3. If you're moving a bunch of workers to virtual, you can use the
transition to make a better organization.
