Here's the high-level framework I used:

- Happy Death
Burying my own folks
Written another fiction book
Trained wild crows to use the CrowBox
Have executed a startup or project that really could change the world

- Retirement in Iceland
Cozy Icelandic Home (and/or Summer House) (which?)
Enough $$ to do WTF we want in Iceland
Trailer + car to travel around country
Be fluent enough in Icelandic to approach a stranger and have a full
conversation about a topic I know little about, all without resorting to
English

- Living near kids/grandkids
Enough $$ to live near kids/grandkids
Careers that allow us to still pursue them part time from wherever that
might be (??)

- Van Travel w/ Hulda around the world
Enough $$ to travel the world in a van (how much?)
Careers that allow us to still pursue them part time from wherever that
might be (??)
Visit Africa and Thailand
Get functional in Spanish (able to convey mostly whatever I need to)

- 2035 Boys moved out
Affairs in order (will, finances, funeral plans)
Complete a TV series I'm proud of
Taught kids all of life skills list

- 2030 3/4 through LWK
Owned a rat racer motorcycle
Own land

- 2025 1/2 through LWK
Spend a quarter learning Spanish
Live a year not in Iceland or USA
US Airstream trip
Taught kids majority of life skills list
Done 5-7 day meditation retreat or psychotropic event

- 2020 1/4 through Life With Kids (LWK)

- J
