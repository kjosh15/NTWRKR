This article was interesting, not least because I feel like we've had
pretty clear communication (especially compared to some of the folks in
this article!) But the point it made was a good one; at some point you
won't get to ask any more questions, and so trying to guess what you might
have wanted to ask can be a blessing.

The article suggests the questions below - if you wanted to share anything,
I'm always happy to hear!

xoxo,
Josh

Do you remember what was going through your head when you first saw me?

How did you choose my name?

What was I like as a baby? As a young child?

Do you remember any of the songs you used to sing to me? Can you sing them
now?

What were my siblings like?

What were the hardest moments you had when I was growing up?

If you could do everything again, would you raise me differently?

What advice would you give me about raising my own kids?

What are your dreams for me?

How did you meet mom/dad?

Are you proud of me?

What were your parents like?

How was your relationship with your parents?

How would you describe yourself as a child? Were you happy?

What is your best memory of childhood? Worst?
