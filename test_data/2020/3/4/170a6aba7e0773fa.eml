I pulled this together as a framework for our call. Let me know if I'm
missing anything!

1) Where we're at now financially:

H4X Chkg: $XX
H4X CC: $XX

Pers Chkg: $XX
Pers CC: $XX

2) Spend:

i.e., once a month ~$Xk of scheduled, ~$Xk to other expenses (mostly food)

3) Inbound:
Estate Tranche One Due: $XX April 6
Estate Tranche Two Due: $XX June
W50      : $XX June

4) Immediate next steps:

empty personal chkg ($XX)
max out personal cc ($XX)
Pull all funds out of business account ($XX)
except fees for having less than $XX in account (any ideas on this?)

total: $XX

5) Possible next steps:

- Bank:
ask about no-minimum fee on Business Account (or I'll leave)

- Josh's folks
ask about tide-us-over-loan ($XXk)

- Chris/Steve Indigo
ask about tide-us-over-cash ($XXk)
; think we need PR pieces, more sales outreach BUT
; could they do this as payment/loan instead of equity?

- Reduce expenses:
Food! Ideas: ???
Budget! Ideas: ???

6) Questions:
My business account has a minimum of $XXk; can I pull this out?
$$ in H's account; is it spendable? Or is it already "an IRA"?
ROTH IRA withdrawal to pay medical insurance (as we've been unemployed for
a while now?)
Should we ask parents for money to knock down CC?
Taxes coming in April; I'm assuming we can defer? (Ask accountant?)
