Agreed, but don't have a template that would work - any materials like this
are outdated at this point. Further, I'd suggest that Bechtel is likely to
inform what this agreement would need to look like. Is it worth waiting for
more feedback from them, or will Liquid be amenable to our adjusting said
agreement if we are proactive in securing it first?
