Here's 5 recent headlines I could speak to along with a one liner on
approach:

Twitter Advises 5,000 Global Employees To Work From Home - Managing the new
coronavirus is a lot easier for tech companies.

Let's Encrypt found a bug in their free SSL certificates - These are the
bits of code which enable us to visit websites securely. Increasingly, it's
only well-funded companies that can afford to compete.

ACLU Sues To End ICE's Rigged Algorithms That Keep Immigrants In Jail - An
excellent example of how AI/Big data exhibits bias, and the reason there
are so many consortiums arguing about ethical tech.

Honeywell Says It Will Soon Launch the World's Most Powerful Quantum
Computer - Quantum computing has been held up as the future of technology
for a long time. Could this be the breaking point?

Facebook Has Built a Fleet of Robots To Patrol Its Data Centers - Workers
being replaced by robots is happening quietly and efficiently.
