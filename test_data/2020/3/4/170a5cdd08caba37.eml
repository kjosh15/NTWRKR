Inside contacts at brokerages so we can get confirmation that this may/may
not be a good opp for them. The problem with Blackrock's real estate
division is a) volume, and b) the deals are mostly scoped and negotiated by
the brokers. So finding a big brokerage like Sotheby's might be just the
ticket.

Next steps are for me to talk to their two teams, and separately for us to
get validation from a brokerage.
