Jaren,

I wanted to share some of the feedback about your Mom's diagnosis and where
to start looking for experts to talk to that I got from a couple of
business contacts who have done deep dives into related fields.

The first point is that both of them made it clear up front that it's a
tough diagnosis and that it's pretty late in the process. That said, they
also thought that if we could find the right expert they may have some
insight we don't know about. The main suggestion amounts to:

"start with finding the leading researchers in the field by looking through
clinical trials and other meta information on the internet. There are
several ways to do this, including (1) looking at medical advisory boards
of leading charities in the field; (2) inspecting clinical trials for the
key researchers at leading institutions (Hopkins, Harvard, Cornell, etc);
and (3) inspecting patient forums. Once you get one expert on the phone,
ask them for five names of other experts in the field."

I've been pushing at my various medical contacts since I first heard of
your Mom's diagnosis, with little luck, and wasn't able to make much sense
(or, tbh, find much optimism) in the materials I found. However, if you can
get a shortlist of names I'm happy to see who I may be able to get
connected to, via LinkedIn or industry connections.

Let me know what you think - I hope this is helpful rather than just
painful.

Love,
Josh
