Michael,

Thanks again for the second conversation; seems like lots of connections
here!

One of the questions you had was about the type of work I did for IDEO.
Obviously I can't discuss anything not publicly known about IDEO, their
business, processes, clients, etc. etc. but I'm happy to outline the type
of strategy work I've done in the past inasmuch as it pertains to the kind
of work I could help BigSpaceship with.

Specifically, this type of strategy work has often involved:

- conducting one-on-one interviews with stakeholders across all offices to
understand the business prerogatives, assets, and opportunities.
- Conducting expert interviews with external clients, potential clients,
area experts, and competitors.
- Synthesised these interviews through a strategic framework either native
to the client (such as IDEO's Play To Win approach) or external as best
fits the needs of the client.
- Expand the strategic recommendation to areas of immediate impact
- Draw out those areas to detail processes, key KPIs with initial tests for
validation, and anticipated outcomes with paired response strategies.
- Create a timeline for test execution, evaluation/validation, and revision=
.
- Indexes of all working material for later analysis and reference, the
formal strategy process, example content (if any are related), detailed
deliverables descriptions and requirements, and any additional value-add
insights otherwise outside of the strategic approach.

Put in human-speak, I dig deeply into the company, detail all the
opportunities and problems that pertain to the project goal, use a formal
strategic method to force rigor in shaping a recommendation, and then
detail that recommendation into a series of actionable tests that can be
used to validate progress towards the recommended goal(s).

That's one type of project I've really enjoyed in the past, and have done
variations for several organizations. Outside of that, and based on what I
know of Big Spaceship's business so far, I've also done a lot of:

- Technology advising. I've helped shape the technological approach for
literally hundreds of projects, processes, companies, startups, R&D
divisions, incubators, TV series, and more. My role is not in outlining
code structures or hacking together prototypes, but in articulating the
value proposition for the client and identifying strategic opportunities
from a diverse set of technologies and business elements to create results
that are more than the sum of their parts. Call it strategic innovation
consulting; this is a lot of what I did for IDEO's clients that underwrote
my strategy work.

- Managing clients and creating partnerships. One of the weird side effects
of being an executive-whisperer is that I've got a unique perspective on
the global market, the ways that emerging technologies can be harnessed,
and where otherwise obtuse partnerships could make great sense.

- Thought Leadership. I.e., TV interviews, articles, books, radio
interviews, blog/podcasts, etc. etc. See a more complete list at
josh.is/writing/

- Program development. I've built the Trust Model for Consumer reports, an
incubator for IMAX, a social good platform for the CMO of Coke, etc.

Finally, I also think I could do well at Business Development. Because I've
spent nearly two decades freelancing in NY and globally, and because for
the last decade that's been almost exclusively and directly to senior
executives of major multinationals, I've got an excellent and unusual
network. While I've used this network to secure funding for startups, to
cross-sell solutions from same, and to develop project partnerships, I
haven't done BD exclusively. But I think I could do a pretty good job of it=
.

Let me know if any of this is food for thought. I hear you that we'd need
to find a client project to attach to, but I'm hopeful we can find
something that would work collaboratively to help build other initiatives.
Happy to discuss any of the above further in a call or f2f!

best,
Josh
