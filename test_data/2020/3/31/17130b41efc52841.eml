Dear Farm Spot Friends and Family,

We hope that you are staying safe and taking care of each other.

As we roll out the 2020 CSA season with Golden Earthworm, we realize that m=
any of you have concerns regarding the upcoming season. We hope that we wil=
l be covering some of these concerns in the email below. If you have other =
questions, please let us know. Apologies if you get multiple copies of this=
 email, we just want to make sure that everyone on our lists get this infor=
mation. Thanks!



This is the link to sign up for the 2020 share:

https://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2020



A) News from the farm=E2=80=A6


Golden Earthworm Farm, the producer of our beautiful organic produce year a=
fter year is on track for delivering to us on the first week of June as pla=
nned. They have seen an uptick in signups due to the concern about food saf=
ety and quality during this time. CSA organic produce is less handled in ge=
neral, and not handled by the public. The farm is committed to food safety =
and is closely monitoring the situation and updating protocols. We are so h=
appy to support this.



Here is their statement regarding food safety:

Our produce is grown is nutrient-rich soil that we have been building for o=
ver two decades. Not only is it 100% Certified Organic and non-GMO, every m=
ember of our staff has been trained in food safety following certification =
training of our management staff through the Produce Safety Alliance. We fo=
llow USDA GAP standards and protocols and we were one of the first farms to=
 adopt these standards more than a decade ago. CSA produce is perhaps the l=
east handled food available. It is harvested in the field, washed and packa=
ged, and then shipped in clean boxes directly to CSA member pick-up sites. =
No warehouses, middle men, extra handling or consumer touching. We will con=
tinue to monitor the situation and adjust our handling protocols as necessa=
ry to ensure that our produce is clean and safe for you.



Please also consider supporting local food through Lewis Waite CSA Extras. =
You can order a la carte items from local farms such as meat, cheese, grain=
, bread, and more. Follow this link as they distribute during our CSA seaso=
n and are also offering delivery during this time.



This year the price of the vegetable share is $680.54 (25 weeks)

Distribution will run from June 4th through November 12th

The price of the fruit share is $101.77 (14 weeks)



As you may know, we run on extremely slim margins in order to keep the pric=
e for the share affordable and to be able to offer a limited amount of subs=
idized shares to community members in need. The price increase this year re=
flects a price increase from the farm which is due to the increased cost of=
 production resulting from the new law in New York State mandating overtime=
 pay for farm employees. Golden Earthworm Farm fully supports this expansio=
n of labor rights to the farm sector - as does Farm Spot - but this will in=
crease the farm's payroll costs, and in turn increase the cost of the share=
. Read more about the Farmworkers Farm Labor Practices Act here.



We are offering a three month installment payment plan for those who prefer=
 to make multiple payments. Please consider making a donation to Farm Spot =
so that we can fundraise for subsidized shares.

B) Farm Spot Updates

Volunteer shifts:
The requirement for membership will still be two shifts per share. We are 1=
00% volunteer run and really value the time that you spend helping to make =
this happen in our neighborhood. Please remember that volunteering is part =
of your responsibility as a Farm Spot member. Megan, our volunteer coordina=
tor, will email with details about volunteer sign ups in May.

Splitting shares:
In past years, Farm Spot has encouraged members to look for share partners =
on social media and community message boards. People have been known to fin=
d share partners on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/farmspotcsa=
/) or on jacksonheightslife.com . If you cannot find a share on your own, p=
lease email farmspot@gmail.com and we will do our best to match you with a =
share partner.

Subsidized share program:

Farm Spot feels that it is imperative to continue to offer a subsidized sha=
re program so that members of the community who fall within specific income=
 requirements, can access fresh organic produce. We have been operating on =
reduced shares since last year, which has made it difficult to fund this pr=
ogram. We continue to rely on donations for the subsidy. Please consider a =
donation (or multiple donations) when you sign up for your share. We are ve=
ry grateful for any type of donation received towards this. We will announc=
e subsidized share sign ups later in the season when we are able to subsidi=
ze them. Please stay tuned.



Looking for core member:
We are looking for a core member - someone who will be responsible for over=
seeing signups and tech support. Core members are volunteers who are involv=
ed in decision making and implementation of actions needed in running a CSA=
. Requirements would also include attending occasional core group meetings,=
 participating in group discussion, and voting on issues regarding the CSA =
(the last two duties are mainly done via email).



If you are interested in becoming a core member, please email farmspot@gmai=
l.com if you are interested or for more information regarding this.



Thank you for reading this all the way through, we look forward to our upco=
ming season!
