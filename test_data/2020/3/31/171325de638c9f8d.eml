I didn't mean to be so brief.

The family is good. Embla went into an early isolation and took the kids
out of school 12 March as she had cancer last year and has no immune system
to fight this if she would fall seriously ill. Harry and Alexia are loving
the homeschooling. They live in our family house so they have a big garden
which makes a huge difference.

Gis and I are hoping to be able to relocate for 10 days or so to
Whitstable where Alfrun our older daughter lives. We live in a small but
cosy flat in London. Our luck is that we are close to the river and some
parks. But it will be nice to have a change of scenery and get out of
London where the epidemic is spreading quickly now.

So far we are counting our blessings. Nobody has become ill and we are all
coping financially and mentally. I wake up every morning and we exercise
with Jo Wick the latest viral PE coach. We meet up I, the girls and the
grandkids over What's App and have fun doing the exercising together and we
hang out and play through the "houseparty" app.

Somehow I think something good will come out of this. Work is still flowing
as I do online teaching and am in development with 3-4 films so I can't
complain. But I look forward to having more social live again as I guess
all of us yearn for.

It would be a great idea for Harry and Odinn to have a Skype or a
Houseparty chat. I will connect you with Embla so you can find time for
them to hang out.

Lots of love to all of you.

xahh
