Good to hear from you!! Yes, we're in NYC - 10m from the epicenter
(Elmherst Hospital). No cars, no foot traffic... just constant ambulances.
I'm working with Abbot to try to get their new 5m tests installed into a
mobile van to help the multi-block long line of people waiting for care, as
nearly half of them are hourly workers who need a Dr's note in order to get
paid while not working.

Otherwise we're great - we formed a cell with another really lovely family
and the kids are adoring homeschooling. How about you? Are you all well and
healthy?

Sending all best wishes,
Josh
