Dear Farm Spot Friends and Family,

We hope that you are staying safe and taking care of each other.

As we roll out the 2020 CSA season with Golden Earthworm, we realize that
many of you have concerns regarding the upcoming season. We hope that we
will be covering some of these concerns in the email below. If you have
other questions, please let us know. Apologies if you get multiple copies
of this email, we just want to make sure that everyone on our lists get
this information. Thanks!


This is the link to sign up for the 2020 share:

https://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2020



*A) News from the farm=E2=80=A6*


Golden Earthworm Farm, the producer of our beautiful organic produce year
after year is on track for delivering to us on the first week of June as
planned. They have seen an uptick in signups due to the concern about food
safety and quality during this time. CSA organic produce is less handled in
general, and not handled by the public. The farm is committed to food
safety and is closely monitoring the situation and updating protocols. We
are so happy to support this.


Here is their statement regarding food safety:

Our produce is grown is nutrient-rich soil that we have been building for
over two decades. Not only is it 100% Certified Organic and non-GMO, every
member of our staff has been trained in food safety following certification
training of our management staff through the Produce Safety Alliance.  We
follow USDA GAP standards and protocols and we were one of the first farms
to adopt these standards more than a decade ago.  CSA produce is perhaps
the least handled food available.  It is harvested in the field, washed and
packaged, and then shipped in clean boxes directly to CSA member pick-up
sites.  No warehouses, middle men, extra handling or consumer touching.  We
will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our handling protocols as
necessary to ensure that our produce is clean and safe for you.



Please also consider supporting local food through Lewis Waite CSA Extras.
You can order a la carte items from local farms such as meat, cheese,
grain, bread, and more. Follow this link <https://www.lewiswaitefarm.com>
as they distribute during our CSA season and are also offering delivery
during this time.


This year the price of the vegetable share is $680.54 (25 weeks)

Distribution will run from June 4th through November 12th

The price of the fruit share is $101.77 (14 weeks)


As you may know, we run on extremely slim margins in order to keep the
price for the share affordable and to be able to offer a limited amount of
subsidized shares to community members in need. The price increase this
year reflects a price increase from the farm which is due to the increased
cost of production resulting from the new law in New York State mandating
overtime pay for farm employees*. *Golden Earthworm Farm fully supports
this expansion of labor rights to the farm sector - as does Farm Spot - but
this will increase the farm's payroll costs, and in turn increase the cost
of the share. Read more about the *Farmworkers Farm Labor Practices Act*
<https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2019/06/ny-assembly-grants-farmworkers-r=
ight-to-unionize-overtime-pay.html>
 here.


We are offering a three month installment payment plan for those who prefer
to make multiple payments. Please consider making a donation to Farm Spot
so that we can fundraise for subsidized shares.

*B) Farm Spot Updates*

Volunteer shifts:
The requirement for membership will still be two shifts per share. We are
100% volunteer run and really value the time that you spend helping to make
this happen in our neighborhood. *Please remember that volunteering is part
of your responsibility as a Farm Spot member*. Megan, our volunteer
coordinator, will email with details about volunteer sign ups in May.

Splitting shares:
In past years, Farm Spot has encouraged members to look for share partners
on social media and community message boards. People have been known to
find share partners on our Facebook page (
https://www.facebook.com/farmspotcsa/) or on jacksonheightslife.com . If
you cannot find a share on your own, please email farmspot@gmail.com and we
will do our best to match you with a share partner.

Subsidized share program:

Farm Spot feels that it is imperative to continue to offer a subsidized
share program so that members of the community who fall within specific
income requirements, can access fresh organic produce. We have been
operating on reduced shares since last year, which has made it difficult to
fund this program. We continue to rely on donations for the subsidy. Please
consider a donation (or multiple donations) when you sign up for your
share. We are very grateful for any type of donation received towards this.
We will announce subsidized share sign ups later in the season when we are
able to subsidize them. Please stay tuned.


Looking for core member:
We are looking for a core member - someone who will be responsible for
overseeing signups and tech support. Core members are volunteers who are
involved in decision making and implementation of actions needed in running
a CSA. Requirements would also include attending occasional core group
meetings, participating in group discussion, and voting on issues regarding
the CSA (the last two duties are mainly done via email).


If you are interested in becoming a core member, please email
farmspot@gmail.com if you are interested or for more information regarding
this.



Thank you for reading this all the way through, we look forward to our
upcoming season!
