Thanks, Shane!

Glen, Andrew, I've been working for the last decade on technology strategy,
focused on new and innovative tech and around the intersection of early
stage startups/tech and large multinationals. An area of particular
interest, especially right now, is CVC and JV focused outside of silicon
valley; i.e., where are the opportunities we don't know we don't know
about?

I've attached a CV and presskit with all the usual stuff about books and TV
and TED talks and past customers, but the part I'm really keen to talk
about is the above, especially given the current pandemic crisis. The
Overton window for technology just got pulled wide open, and I'm curious
how you're tackling that.

Let me know if it's worth a followup conversation!
Josh
