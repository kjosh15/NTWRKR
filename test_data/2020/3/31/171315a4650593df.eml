Many thanks, Anna Hildur! Yes, NYC is scary at the moment, and we live ten
minute's walk from Elmhurst Hospital, the epicenter of the disease in the
USA. Fortunately, we've created a cell with another family and the kids are
loving the home schooling that's been set up; they're flourishing with all
the parental attention. The adults are time-sharing each other's
apartments, which creates enough distance to keep us from going too crazy.
The hardest thing is that there are almost no cars or foot traffic... just
the constant sound of sirens.

Here's a short bio (I tried to rewrite it from the bombastic US style but
no matter what I write, I keep seeing the Icelandic raised eyebrow...)! Let
me know if it grates, please:

"Josh has been working for the last decade and a half on technology
strategy, focused on new and innovative tech and around the intersection of
early stage startups/tech and large multinationals. His three books, three
television series, and numerous international talks reflect this focus, as
does his work consulting and advising startups and large multinationals
alike."

I've attached a CV and presskit with all the usual stuff, and would be
really curious about how he's looking to adjust their curriculum in light
of the pandemic. The Overton window for technology just got pulled wide
open, and we have an opportunity to make all kinds of important changes.

Finally - and perhaps most importantly - how is your family? Would Harry
like to skype with =C3=93=C3=B0inn sometime? Much love to all!

Kve=C3=B0ja,
Josh
