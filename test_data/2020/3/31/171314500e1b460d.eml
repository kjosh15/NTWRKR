Genius, thanks so much, Rachel!! Interesting times indeed - I'm starting to
get sent a steady stream of overly-optimistic pieces to the tune of =E2=80=
=9CThis
is a moment where the source code of capitalism can be reworked.=E2=80=9D G=
rain of
salt, clearly, but also some very clear articulations that business as
usual just can't be anymore. Very curious to see how that slots with us
having only three retail brands left in the USA when the dust settles...

The really interesting thing for me is to sit on calls with senior execs of
major multinationals every day and hear how their thinking is changing.
They haven't quite gotten to the point of "let's seize the opportunity" but
they're not far out. Indigometrics is perfectly poised for this, so I'm
excited to see how/where we can get started on that front.

Actually, to that end - if everyone is WFH now, are you focusing mostly on
open source exercises? If so, we could set you up with the platform just
during this period to help you figure out where people are dropping off due
to lack of culture exposure/exasperation/team fatigue/etc. Thoughts?

And +1 on the numbers. I ran my own models and found good reason to think
that a healthy adult in our demo could expect .5% mortality risk or less.
Not exactly safe as driving, but if you have to take your chances you could
ask for worse. Where did your calculations net out?

W/regards to Geniecast, I'd love an intro! Normally this is the hottest
time of year for my talks, which as you can imagine have all been
cancelled. Never before have I heard "force majeure" clauses invoked so
vehemently! Here's a short bio:

"Josh started as a hacker in his parent's basement and ended up working
with leaders at the upper echelon of business, government, and internet
security. From black market economies to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,
from the radical departures in exchange and marketing enabled by Big Data
to the as-yet-unrealized analytic capabilities of Cloud Computing, Josh has
specialized in translating these insights into actionable strategies for
business leaders."

I've attached my CV and presskit. Let me know what else I can do, and/or do
to help!

    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It=E2=80=99s going to be a disaster either way, bu=
t we have no purview into when travel might open back up or where is likely=
 to be safer short- or long-term, and safety for our family is our top prio=
rity.
    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have any words of wisdom? I=E2=80=99m sure =
you=E2=80=99re crazy slammed right now, but I need some clear thinking of t=
he geopolitical variety and you=E2=80=99re one of the best minds I know in =
this space. Any help is appreciated.
    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All best,
