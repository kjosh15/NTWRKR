Yes and yes, my thoughts exactly on both counts. I don't like the idea of
adding more cooks to the kitchen before an official raise, but also think
we need some help to capitalize on the current opportunity.

I DO think we should rework all models with an estimated $10mm raise in
mind, however - pre-COVID, almost all the VC deals were in the $10-20
range, with smaller being considered "cute" but not serious. If we start
with that kind of size expectation it makes it easier to suggest they buy
less stock for more cash, and I don't think he'll be too startled to see
those sorts of numbers to start the conversation.

I could work well with Michael; we're both big idea guys who like to geek
out on our big ideas, but he can also clearly execute - witness he's had no
investment and been operating well for two decades. Regardless, you should
meet him.

For next steps why don't I suggest we three get on a conference call so you
two can meet and to try to get more detail on next steps? He suggested
today but it's almost half over here and I'm booked anyway, but could you
do later this week? Second question is if you can make up a really big
valuation model to frame initial negotiations more favorably.
