Hey!

SXSW is right around the corner, I hope you are getting just as excited as
I am. If any of your plans have changed or if you have any outstanding
questions / comments / concerns about your session, please let me know
ASAP. In the meantime, I want to take a minute to share some important
information for the event before you arrive

First and foremost, my responsibilities as a CSA end when SXSW begins on
March 13th. If you need anything after that date please reach out to your
Track Lead or see point 1a below.

1. Registration Hours: When you arrive, you will need to go to the
Registration area in the Austin Convention Center to pick up your badge.
You can find our registration hours here: https://www.sxsw.com/attend/

1a. The Speaker Help Desk (located in the Austin Convention Center Exhibit
Hall 1) is the best place to get questions answered onsite, there will be a
SXSW Staff member there whenever registration is open.

2. The Green Room: This is where all speakers will need to check in before
your session begins, ONE (1) hour beforehand. While you should be able to
locate the green room information in the Session Production Guide.

3. Your Presentation: If you have prepared a visual presentation, be sure
to bring it with you! There will be a computer in the room for you to use,
or you may opt to connect your own computer to the projector. Please note
that the computer is a Windows based computer, so if you do bring your
presentation on a thumb drive, make sure it=E2=80=99s in a compatible Power=
Point
format. Additional AV information can be found in the Session Production
Guide.

3a: Your Presentation URL: While we did give you the option to submit your
presentation URL to be added to the online schedule with a deadline, this
is optional. This is information that will show up on the schedule. Think
of it like a sneak peek of your session or a way for attendees to access
your session presentation before, during, or after session. Note: This has
no effect on the presentation that you need to bring with you to your
session. These are two separate things.

4. Day Passes: If you have entered day pass information into the Session
Production Guide, then you are set! Just have your guest come to the
=E2=80=9CSpeaker Help Desk=E2=80=9D area at registration the day of your se=
ssion with a
valid ID, and we=E2=80=99ll be able to give them their day pass. We=E2=80=
=99ll have a list
on site with all the names.

5. Attendee Feedback: We strongly encourage attendees to give feedback in
the SXSW GO app following sessions. This is something you can do when you
attend other sessions and something you can encourage attendees in your
session to do. We read through all feedback following the event and it can
help us decide if we want to invite a speaker back the following year.

6. Please share this information with all the speakers for your session but
know that they will also be receiving an email from SXSW with this
information as well.

I think that's about it! I hope I get a chance to meet you once we get to
Austin but if not, I hope you have a great SXSW and a successful session.
If you need anything before the event, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Once SXSW starts I will no longer be available via email.

Best,
Margot Vidal
