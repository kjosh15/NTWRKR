Let me know if you're in town and up for a glass of wine sometime. No huge
rush (unless there's a need on your end), but I've been doing some work
with Avery Dennison (who is doing some RFID/UHF/BLE tracking tech work in
your space) and chatting with a friend deep into AI at Google around
distributed AI. Just the usual panoply of disruptive tech - always a
pleasure to get your take and compare notes!

All best,
Josh
