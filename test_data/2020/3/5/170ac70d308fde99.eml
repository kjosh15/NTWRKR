I had another contact take a look at this but they sent it back as an .indd
file, so now I need someone to open it, save it as a .pdf, and send it
back. If it looks good I'll owe them a favor, but if it needs fonts
installed to match the existing .indd file I'd happily pay $25 for the
trouble.

Does your contact care to open the attachment, convert it to .pdf, and help
me find which?

Thanks!!
Josh
