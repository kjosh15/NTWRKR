Anne,

Thanks again for meeting the other day - really appreciate you making the
time! You'd asked for a short summary of the microtargeting pitch to float
by:

a) your real estate research team (for a reality check), as well as
b) the general marketing team to see if it could be applied more broadly.

Please find a short description below, and let me know if I can ever return
the favor!!

"By using online, purchasable data to focus on depth over breadth, we
propose using several disparate technologies to hyper target small numbers
of specific decision makers prior to final close on high value deals.
Supercookies, heavily screened organic, and geolocative marketing
techniques will be used to deliver authentic content. By creating an
inverse social graph we can also target the influencers who help shape the
decision maker's opinions.

The overall goal is to quietly and effectively produce background
impressions over 1-3 months to shift these individual's view of high-value
assets just prior to a sale or purchase. This would be an exclusive,
private service designed to create significant (>1%) improvements in
overall return on assets while also supporting rapidly increasing scope and
scale."

Enjoy the lack of travel,
Josh
