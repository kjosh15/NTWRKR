Think about purpose of the school

Articulate that well first; what the difference to other schools is

Then when you position Makerfaire or whatever harness them power of what
drew me to the school in the first place

What made EB special?

Where does that align with other corps?

Education stuff works best locally!!

Who is your shortlist of companies in NYC?

Big banks? They all have a community focus but will likely have already
donated

So what=E2=80=99s unique as a connection to your school

Could auction off work from the makerfaire to the neighborhood

Run an auction for the school?

Tap into alumni!!

Start with purpose
Think about work boys are doing to impact larger community
Some co=E2=80=99s might be willing to showcase their work in lobby - build
relationships with specific

Collateral: get josh to be spokesperson
   Start with purpose and why it exists
   For video keep it less than 2m - 1m is better!!
   Video is very appealing

But first start with very sincere letter to parents
   Mission of school
   Ask to raise fund
   Intro to community relations person at parents companies

Mid to large companies will all have community affairs team

Letter is place to start
Then send email with video messGe
Don=E2=80=99t use video ad first touch
Business letter first
  Mission
  Purpose
  Ask

Invest in a 1-2 page glossy brochure that articulates the school purpose,
strategic plan, profile 1 or 2 kids and what a difference the school has
made in their lives

Bring to life the schools mission,  little testimonial

So: business letter and brochure to send to parents to pass on, then follow
up with video

Start with heartfelt message - people connect with a personal story
