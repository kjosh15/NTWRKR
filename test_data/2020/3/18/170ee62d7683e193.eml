I'm more bullish on what we can do AFTER we hit peak infection. I think
there will be increasing appetite for climbing back up the curve and
getting ahead of any recession, and we'll have a good pitch when we do.
Let's revisit in a couple weeks.

That said, I hear you about customers dropping like flies. It's not a good
week to be an entrepreneur. Be safe!
