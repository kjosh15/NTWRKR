I want to make sure I catch your CNBC clip! I'm all the more thankful for
your work and heart during this wacky time.

Here's what I'm advising about. I got tapped for a project funded by a job
search engine about the future of work a week ago. I am making a
recommendation that in a time of flux and uncertainty to uplift people who
can help job seekers and job fillers navigate the new normal.

This is now one of my outlets to channel my concern after reading about
projections of 20% unemployment and what this means for vulnerable
populations in our workforce. The haves somehow do just fine during these
times and can stress about their investments, it's everyone else I'm
thinking about (and you probably are too). Maybe upside is that it's
accelerating needed change and exposes what's broken.
