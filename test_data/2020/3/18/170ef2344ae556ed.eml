Jeff,

First off, I hope you and yours are healthy and safe. These are interesting
times and I'm sure you've got your hands full!

I did want to set a time to further discuss the opportunity you described
in our last conversation, however. This is a terrible time for many people,
but especially the immunocompromised. The studies you described could offer
a very real opportunity for people to take control in the face of daunting
circumstances, and shifting expectations may actually make clinical studies
easier if we can show early, promising results.

Let me know what your schedule looks like; I'm juggling calls and meetings
but am keen to make time for this.

All best,
Josh
