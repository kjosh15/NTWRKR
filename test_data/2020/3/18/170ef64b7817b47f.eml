Here's the high level view of my new pitch; what do you think, and is
articulating this appealing to Ketchum?

- Most of your team is telecommuting; the risk for conduct risk, IP spread,
and PR damage has never been higher.

- The only control you have is cultural; what your employees believe and
how they behave.

- Without Indigo, you can't see that. With Indigo, you can measure, plan,
iterate, and manage it.

Be well, my friend!
