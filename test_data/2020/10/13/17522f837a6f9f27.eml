Devon,

I was trying to update the cat's microchips and found out that although
both of them had them - and they'd been being scanned on entry to the vet
at least twice a year for MORE THAN A DECADE - they were never actually
registered into a national database.

I went to the registration site, https://www.petlink.net/, and found that
you can enter in each microchip # and register it to an address and contact
info. Rather than putting all your personal info into a commercial site I
thought I'd offer for you to do it yourself so you could choose shield #'s
or addresses if you wanted.

That cat's numbers are:

Bastet: 0A10666A0A (National)
Rexy: 981020001816467 (Int'l)

Let me know how/if I can help further!

Love,
Josh
