Yeah, big pharma is fun. I prefer the smaller ones though - much more
potential and growth ahead.

Most malpractice in # of cases towards Big4 is I think tax for
multi-jurisdictional people, anecdotal from a friend that works for a
captive insurance company of one of the Big4.
There isn't a great deal of experience in it in Iceland though there might
be individuals within CCP, DeCode, etc who have had some experience. Maybe
Deloitte Iceland has some experience as they have/have had both =C3=96ssur =
and
CCP as longtime clients who have had or currently have US employees. I'll
ask one of the partners now.
There is a reason many US citizens give up that citizenship.

Yeah, you have a valid point re the laying down of rules. It looks like
things are improving with a higher % in quarantine at the time of
diagnosis.

I don't think I'll pass through Iceland again until next summer. I did not
handle the 5-day quarantine very well. Crawling up the walls by day 2/3.
But will let you know. Same if you drop by in London.
