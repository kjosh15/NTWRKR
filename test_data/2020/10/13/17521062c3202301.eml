Chris,

I'm prepping our SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS updates and need to know if there are
any domains that relay for us? Specifically via AWS. This includes all
domains and sending services (such as marketing campaign platforms or
invoice generators, also referred to as ESPs) that are authorized to send
email on our behalf. I'll need DKIM public keys from them if we have them
so we don't break anything.

Thanks!
- J
