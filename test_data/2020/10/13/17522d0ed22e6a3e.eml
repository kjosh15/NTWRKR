Ingvi Bj=C3=B6rn suggested you might be helpful; I'm trying to find someone=
 who
can help me file taxes as an USA citizen recently moved to Iceland.

I have citizenship here and will have been here for six months Dec 16th
(and so established residency). I plan to make an LLC here starting in the
new year in order to manage my technology strategy consultancy work (as
I've been told this is the most tax effective strategy.)

Can you advise on either matter?

Very much obliged,
Josh
