Hey, just wanted to throw in how grateful I am that you're diving in so
deeply to help this guy!! You're awesome!

All best,

Glad to hear you were able to switch to Phase One. This tells me that
there's no problem with the CrOS software that was uploaded to the Arduino.
It's rare, but you can sometimes get a bad upload. The software is
definitely not running correctly when the servo is installed but it's a
good sign that it runs correctly when the servo is disconnected. I mean, in
terms of making sure the problem is not onboard the Arduino.

Always ask all the questions you want- Josh and I are here to help and
we'll help as much as we can.

I'll talk more about the servo. First, the servo has three wires:

-RED wire, this is the positive power connection
-BROWN wire, this is the negative power connection
-ORANGE wire, this is the signal wire which allows the Arduino to signal
the servo, telling it what position is desired

So the Orange signal wire gets connected to pin 9 on the Arduino. The other
two (red and brown) go to the breadboard and plug directly into power.

What I'd like you to do is follow the red and brown wires to the breadboard
and reverse their positions. I just want to rule out the possibility that
the servo is trying to operate with polarity reversed. So power down the
Crowbox, swap the brown and red wires (at the breadboard) and power back
up. Let me know what you see. If there is no improvement, return the red
and brown wires to their original positions and we'll move on.

I think there's three things left we can do, and here they are in order:


-I will review all of your wiring in the photos one more time. I didn't
spot any problems but I'll double check this.

-I will email you a copy of the CrOS software which never attempts to move
the servo. You can upload this to your Arduino and we can try running it
with the servo physically connected, but the Crowbox will never try to talk
to the servo. This way we can figure out whether the problem we're seeing
is due to the mere presence of the servo, or only occurs when we ask the
servo to move.

-If you are willing, I'll mail you a replacement power adapter and servo.
It's starting to look like something *MUST* be wrong with either the power
quality or the servo itself. We're running out of obvious reasons why your
Crowbox isn't working and it's time to start being suspicious of these two
pieces of critical hardware.

ltr">Glad to hear you were able to switch to Phase One. This tells me that =
there&#39;s no problem with the CrOS software that was uploaded to the Ardu=
ino. It&#39;s rare, but you can sometimes get a bad upload. The software is=
 definitely not running correctly when the servo is installed but it&#39;s =
a good sign that it runs correctly when the servo is disconnected. I mean, =
in terms of making sure the problem is not onboard the Arduino.<div><br></d=
iv><div>Always ask all the questions you want- Josh and I are here to help =
and we&#39;ll help as much as we can.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll tal=
k more about the servo. First, the servo has three wires:</div><div><br></d=
iv><div>-RED wire, this is the positive power connection</div><div>-BROWN w=
ire, this is the negative power connection</div><div>-ORANGE wire, this is =
the signal wire which allows the Arduino to signal the servo, telling it wh=
at position is desired</div><div><br></div><div>So the Orange signal wire g=
ets connected to pin 9 on the Arduino. The other two (red and brown) go to =
the breadboard and plug directly into power.</div><div><br></div><div>What =
I&#39;d like you to do is follow the red and brown wires to the breadboard =
and reverse their positions. I just want to rule out the possibility that t=
he servo is trying to operate with polarity reversed. So power down the Cro=
wbox, swap the brown and red wires (at the breadboard) and power back up. L=
et me know what you see. If there is no improvement, return the red and bro=
wn wires to their original positions and we&#39;ll move on.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>I think there&#39;s three things left we can do, and here t=
hey are in order:</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>-I will review al=
l of your wiring in the photos one more time. I didn&#39;t spot any problem=
s but I&#39;ll double check this.</div><div><br></div><div>-I will email yo=
u a copy of the CrOS software which never attempts to move the servo. You c=
an upload this to your Arduino and we can try running it with the servo phy=
sically connected, but the Crowbox will never try to talk to the servo. Thi=
s way we can figure out whether the problem we&#39;re seeing is due to the =
mere presence of the servo, or only occurs when we ask the servo to move.</=
div><div><br></div><div>-If you are willing, I&#39;ll mail you a replacemen=
t power adapter and servo. It&#39;s starting to look like something *MUST* =
be wrong with either the power quality or the servo itself. We&#39;re runni=
ng out of obvious reasons why your Crowbox isn&#39;t working and it&#39;s t=
ime to start being suspicious of these two pieces of critical hardware.</di=

liminated. This still leaves a bunch of ideas for troubleshooting. The most=
 recent video you sent was very helpful, and demonstrates behavior from the=
 Crowbox that was worse than I thought.</p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=
=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Is it correct that to make this mo=
st recent video, you just turned on the camera, then turned on the Crowbox =
and did nothing else? All on its own, the Crowbox just keeps blinking that =
light and moving the servo?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>=
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">The LED that is blinking should only blin=
k when you change the training phase by pressing the little button that is =
installed on the breadboard. I&#39;d like for you to disable this button an=
d try running your Crowbox again. Just unplug the Crowbox from power and pu=
ll that button out of the breadboard. Or, perhaps better, just pull one of =
this button&#39;s jumper wires out of the breadboard. In your build these w=
ires are blue and green, it doesn&#39;t matter which you unplug, just be su=
re the conductive end of the jumper you remove doesn&#39;t touch any of the=
 other wires or conductive components. Then power up your Crowbox again.=C2=
=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"M=
soNormal">As you&#39;ve seen on YouTube, the correct Crowbox Lid starting s=
equence should look like this if you watch/listen to the servo:</p></div><d=

-open position</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">-There&#39;s a pause, t=
hen lid closes in 15 tiny steps (try to count the servo pulses if your lid =
is not installed- there should be 15 pulses if this operation completes)</p=
></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">-Servo becomes still</p></div><div><p cl=
ass=3D"MsoNormal">-NOTE: Depending on which training phase the box is actua=
lly in, the lid may at this point pull to the fully-open position and THEN =
the servo will become still.=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=
=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">But the important thing we&#39;re =
looking for is that we get those 15 servo steps/pulses. This would mean the=
 lid was able to properly close without being interrupted by whatever is cu=
rrently tripping your Crowbox over and over. If we see this normal behavior=
 we can suspect a bad/shorted switch or perhaps that the switch is improper=
ly installed, or that somehow the switch in use is pinned-out differently t=
han the switches from the batch all Crowbox prototypes were built with. All=
 of these are simple to fix.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p=
></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you still have problems after this, p=
ower down your Crowbox again and also disconnect one of the breadboard wire=
s belonging to the Perch Switches. Then power up again to see how it behave=
s with the Perch Switches and the Training Phase switch disabled.</p></div>=
<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Aft=
er this we&#39;re going to have to look at power problems. Either issues wi=
th low-current, or noise in the power supply. Just to get ahead on this iss=
ue, can you send me any specs you have on the servo you installed? A link t=
o the page where you bought it, or a datasheet would be perfect. I don&#39;=
t see how the servo could be drawing more than 2 amps and browning out the =
system, but I do want to double check that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNo=
rmal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">I have dealt with two oth=
er Crowboxes that behaved erratically and both had bad power supplies- one =
person was using a 500mA rated power supply which isn&#39;t enough current,=
 and the other just had a power supply that was rated at 2A but did not fun=
ction properly and deliver clean power. I know we&#39;ve already tried your=
 friend&#39;s adapter (that was 2A as well, right?) so it&#39;s difficult t=
o continue suspecting the actual power adapter in your case, so I&#39;m a=
=C2=A0 bit puzzled.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><d=

iv><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">First- I&#39;m reall=
y glad you were able to swap the servo and the Arduino. This is really help=
ful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of builds that I&#39;m awar=
e of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very high quality and reliabili=
ty but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones. Not only do you hav=
e a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can stop worrying about=
 that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">Se=
cond- Did you make any changes at all to the CrOS source code?</p></div><di=
v><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div>=
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">Right now I suspect the=
re&#39;s a power supply issue so we should check a couple of things to see =
if we can rule that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know o=
f two builds which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibit=
ed odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrO=
S software shouldn&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least=
, not in the order you described.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" styl=
e=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=
=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">First, a fact about servo operation: When the servo=
 first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the syste=
m is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, t=
his current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes c=
ause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it=
 will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could ex=
plain why your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNo=
rmal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorm=
al" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">Here are three problems I&#39;d like you t=
o help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mar=
gin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margi=
n-left:33.6pt">1) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduin=
o still connected to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5=
V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from th=
e USB connection and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo,=
 so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" sty=
le=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=
=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">2) Make sure the power supply you are using is a 5V=
/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but the se=
rvo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power su=
pply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, =
the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) p=
ower supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div>=
<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><d=
iv><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">3) If you are alread=
y using a power supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try=
 swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply=
-related problems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power s=
upply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was fau=
lty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorm=
