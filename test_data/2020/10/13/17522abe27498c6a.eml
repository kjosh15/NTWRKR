Dear Friends and Family,



Autumn is beautiful here.  The wind has picked up moving the clouds across
the sky at a rapid rate which produces more rainbows.  The leaves are
changing and our lives here are changing too. Eric can now put weight on
his foot and is walking without crutches! His distance is increasing by the
day and he officially starts physical therapy tomorrow.   The biggest
change is that we now have a car! We bought a 2014 Lexus Hybrid and are now
able to explore areas previously unavailable to us by public transit and
bicycling.  We are both getting used to driving here.  It is not driving on
the left side that is the most difficult, it is driving with the steering
wheel on the right! Eric took to it right away, but I hit the curb a few
times in the process of reorienting where the car is in the lane.  Our
American Licenses are good here until February, but I am studying for the
written test currently and then will enroll in the mandatory classes soon
so I don=E2=80=99t have to rush at the last minute.



With a vehicle, we were able to drive over the Wicklow Pass which was
gorgeous.  It was a beautiful day and there were amazing landscapes and
lakes to look at.  We will definitely go back for some hiking once Eric is
cleared to do so!  We also drove up to the coast on the north side of
Dublin and explored an estuary there.  The beach reminded me of Washington,
it was rocky and littered with mollusk shells of every variety along with
seaweed, the bubble wrap kind not the kelp.  We saw some people clamming
and there were several birds of various persuasions which most likely
accounted for the majority of mollusk and crab shells scattered around the
beach.



We have also been up to Athlone a few times as we are very interested in a
house there.  We have put a bid on it and should be receiving confirmation
sometime tomorrow.  Send good thoughts, it is amazing and has plenty of
room for guests! We will share more details about it if our offer is
accepted.  Athlone is in the middle of the country about halfway between
Dublin and Galway along the river Shannon and boasts the oldest bar that
has continually operated in the world, Sean=E2=80=99s Bar.  The house we ar=
e
looking at is out in the country close to a little village called Moate.  I=
t
is worth checking out the amenities available in Moate on their Wikipedia
page if you have a minute: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moate



We hope everyone is staying safe and taking care of yourselves and each
other.  We miss you and hope that travel resumes sometime in the near
future!
