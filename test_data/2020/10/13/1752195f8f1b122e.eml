=C3=93lafur =C3=81g=C3=BAst Hl=C3=AD=C3=B0arsson there offered us two month=
s free, including the
router, for 1Gb/s Internet at Vi=C3=B0ifell, 607 Akureyri. After that, cost
would be 500gb =C3=A0 5.190kr + router =C3=A0 990kr =3D 6180 ISK/month. If =
that's
correct, I'd like to activate the line starting on October 15th. We can
pick up the router tomorrow in Akureyri.

Additionally, I'd like to know if you can provide a hotspot to attach to
the line so we can have functioning cell coverage around the house.

Yesterday I contacted you around 10am and was told =C3=93lafur would contac=
t me
within an hour with instructions, but I never heard anything. I need to
have Internet active on the 15th for my work; what is needed to make this
happen?
