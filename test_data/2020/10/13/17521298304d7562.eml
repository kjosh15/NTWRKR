Sounds great - let me know what they say!

I heard back from the Texas company that built the show around animal
intelligence and it looks like Ellen DeGeneres did indeed buy it and is
still sitting on it... That said, they reminded me that they did a
treatment (attached) based on a conversation we had around my experience
doing Smart China and suggested that you'd be the right team to shop it to
Netflix.

The show is essentially Anthony Bourdain for tech; the idea is that
technologies uniquely emerge from different places and cultures. Once we
have a vaccine, the world is going to be hungry for travel and tech has
never been a bigger topic - this show would hit the sweet spot in showing
where, why, and how technologies emerge from the wierdest places. I've got
a list as long as my arm of interesting, exotic places that somehow
produced technology that's changing the world (and which most people have
no idea about.) Let me know what you think and if it's worth including in
the conversation with Netflix!

Finally, please do hook me into Fire and Emergency NZ - I'm super
interested to see how we could unify everyone involved. If it's
volunteer-run you've already got buy-in to some core values; spelling those
out and creating participatory metrics could really galvanize people.

All best,
Josh

*love* how it stitches together all kinds of different scientific
implications and history for each element. Super, super fun. I know it's
not the right demographic, but the Storybots series for kids keeps coming
to mind - just the energy, excitement, and light touch on many different
aspects of scientific topics. Very cool.

Elements is ideal as it's so... elemental. But You could expand this to
cover core concepts of any field; physics, or law, or disease... it's
essentially taking a categorical approach that underwrites human history
and using it as a lens to explore how humans have shaped their world.
