Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/aminuddin.h.s%40gmail.com/69607a90-3a53-4169-bce7-8f8d81550d94) and =
I'll make sure not to email you in the future!

I figured I'd try something different. We've worked together before, and =
more importantly you're someone I *enjoyed* working with, and would work =
with again. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; reply with an =
update on your current projects, or schedule a time(https://josh.=

Looking forward to reconnecting,
Josh

Current Projects:

com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
