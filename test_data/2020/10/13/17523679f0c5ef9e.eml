Hi! I've been working on building a crowbox and my brain has totally 
latched onto this as something I'd like to chip in some of my free time 
this winter on. Thanks so much for all of your efforts everybody, Josh 
especially. It's been really fun to start working on building one, and 
that's very much attributed to your massive efforts and all of the material 
that's been put together so far.

I remember your ted talk from way back and have always loved the idea. 
After some googling I ended up on your project. I was just going to hack 
together some things from a now defunct automatic dog feeder I have sitting 
around, but this is so much better!

@Josh, what are your thoughts on creating a repo or two on github or 
gitlab? One for the code, and one for the shape files and pdf print 
templates etc? I'd consider forking the shape files and making some 
proposed modifications to them -- I've got a lot of ideas floating around 
-- not really "waterproofing it", but minimizing water damage potential and 
making it more weather resistant (I'm in Colorado so get to do real world 
testing, haha).

Here are some of the ideas I've formed so far and will bring as proposals 
if we had things up on github or gitlab. I know full well that a lot of 
these things may necessitate re-recording some of the really amazing videos 
at some time in the future, but I've got a couple solutions about how some 
division in the housing will make it easier to version things, including 
generating new videos in the future.

   1. Add drainage on base panel (drainage holes in all four corners, and 
   small grid of drainage hopes near the coin sensor assembly / coin entrance)
   2. Move power supply hole to the bottom
   3. Make the front/basket subassembly replaceable using 3m 
   nuts/bolts/washers (this would allow for minor versions -- v2.0 -> v2.1 
   could be only adjustments to the the basket subassembly, or changes to 
   improve the base subassembly independently, or testing different material / 
   color options)
   4. Switch to metric for everything (I see inches in some places, and 
   even as an American I don't want to anymore, haha)
   5. Migrate to using a single limit switch in the back of the machine by 
   the perch hook (is there a redundancy reason for the two limit switches 
   that I'm missing maybe?)
   6. Remove the perch hook and include it into the shape of the perch 
   platform
   7. Find and utilize a standard adapter measurement for the base 
   reinforcing ring / bolt holes in base panel (for this I mean something 
   like https://www.globalindustrial.com/g/plumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-flanges 
   -- are there international options for this kind of thing as well, or some 
   other standard?)
   8. Add more hex nut shapes that can be glued on the inside (in the Final 
   Assembly - Step 2 video, a couple nuts are hot glued to the inside, but we 
   should provide pieces like the included hex wrenches that can be glued in 
   places with the washer/bolt -- this would also be part of idea 3)
   9. Provide water resistant housing alternative to the sled (I'd also 
   like for this to better fit on the shelves / slide in out / potentially be 
   oriented vertically on the rear panel instead of horizontally and removing 
   the front sled shelf)
   10. Remove the need for the soldering iron and related steps (I don't 
   think we need to solder to the limit switch(es) or the alligator clips, 
   crimping things should be enough for solid contact, even in weathering 
   conditions, right?)

Here's a couple questions for you Josh. How concerned are we in terms of 
cost associated with the housing build? I don't plan on making it super 
expensive or anything, but it may be worth having some priorities for which 
things I can/we optimize towards?

Like, build quality/durability, simplicity of build, simplicity in 
ordering, cost of build, flexibility in versioning / color options (I want 
to do this purely so I can test different colors), flexibility in options 
(for instance, the housing alternative to the sled), etc.

Thanks again! It's been really enjoyable to work on the crowbox so far, and 
if I can, I'd be happy to help out in other ways too. I'm a software 
engineer, and am interested in discussing the code / hardware as well -- 
including a raspberry pi implementation, but that's an entirely different 
topic and one I haven't dived into fully yet.
