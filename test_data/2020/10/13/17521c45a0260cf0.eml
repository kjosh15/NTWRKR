Pinging you one last time: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, =
and to see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and =
the view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call(https://josh.is/scheduling)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest Click =

929/anitaalbright%40yahoo.com/a8d63835-2278-4691-9b52-d4216d6f937e) and =
I'll make sure not to pester you in the future!
