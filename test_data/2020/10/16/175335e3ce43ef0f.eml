Argentinian Malbec. The stars were free. :)

Much much love and thanks to you all - I was standing by myself by the
grill, thinking about how strange and lonely this time in the world is
while looking up at the stars and the big empty sky. Feeling you all in my
heart, and knowing you were a part of me despite all this distance and
chaos... that somehow made my birthday feel full.

Family isn=E2=80=99t perfect, but when you=E2=80=99re on the opposite side =
of the world in
a pandemic I=E2=80=99ve found it makes all the difference. :)

Much love,
Josh
