Othinn weekly update:

Parent teacher meetings in Iceland this week. He's doing great on every
subject except he could improve on writing. I'll nudge him to prioritise
writing on paper with a pencil in his seesaw projects.

He met with a speech pathologist on Wednesday. She'll be working with him
on rolling his R which he needs for Icelandic.

We moved within Iceland so the participation on Seesaw has been low this
week.

Independent reading on the Kindle, a bunch of Garfield and other graphic
novels and Charlie and the chocolate factory read to him before sleep. Then
of course Epic which you see. Outside of school screen time he's allowed
some video games and shows on Saturday and Sunday so most leisure time he
has is he spends either reading or doing art.

Josh will share his prodigy progress. Prodigy is his favorite learning
space at the moment.

All the best,
Hulda
