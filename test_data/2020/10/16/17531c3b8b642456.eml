Finally heard back from my CAA contact. She asks:

"This is awesome. Can you please send an official letter addressed to her
summarizing all of this so I can forward to her team?"

Let me know if you have something "official" - maybe this means a
letterheaded PDF?? Anyway, send me what you think is best and I'll push it
across.

All best,
Josh
