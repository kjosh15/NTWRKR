Josh, I really like this. The nuts and bolts and even nuance are there. =
I can really better understand your background as well by reading this =
document, and that=E2=80=99s super helpful.

We=E2=80=99re a good pairing for such a program, as I come from the =
other side of the coin but have a great affection for tech and what =
you=E2=80=99ve described here.

The key to these things is natural language. Joe Sixpack, as was =
famously dreamt up by an Alaskan politician of yesteryear, is always a =
good barometer. That=E2=80=99s who you are writing for=E2=80=94some guy =
who is sitting at home looking for something to watch and reading your =
pitch.

That=E2=80=99s to say, these are meant to be written simplistically.

A good way to see what that actually looks like is to Google the =
descriptions of TV shows, written by the networks. For instance, Comedy =
Central describes The Daily Show as: "The Daily Show is an Emmy and =
Peabody Award-winning program that looks at the day's top headlines =
through a sharp, reality-based lens.=E2=80=9D

You might be wondering, =E2=80=9CWhat the hell does that mean?=E2=80=9D

And that=E2=80=99s the point. It=E2=80=99s vague yet straight to the =
point. There aren=E2=80=99t too many technical terms, etc.

I rewrote, retooled, added to and went a bit nuts here =
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgLPT09kjaVKNxUexKrkUs0j8VmqPQYJPJ-Vg=
99WfsE/edit?usp=3Dsharing>. This is not good but just another submission =
that I will look forward to having altered and ripped up.

There are so many <https://nofilmschool.com/film-treatment> great =
resources for this.

Do you have a Gmail address that I can use to invite you to modify this =
document?

Feel free to amend.

Thanks,
Matt
