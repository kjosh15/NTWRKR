Thanks, Jay. That's not a big surprise to me but it does rule out a wiring
error that was possible. Sounds like you had the servo wired properly the
first time, which is what I assumed but it was worth testing. Be sure to
restore the servo wiring to the way you had it before.

Alright, so this is by far the most involved troubleshooting issue we've
had with a Crowbox. Based on my experiences with your case and with the
other users who had similar issues, we must strongly suspect either a bad
servo or a bad power supply. There's nothing left to try until we rule out
the possibility of a failure inside one of these two components that we
can't service or troubleshoot.

I have a decent supply of spare Crowbox parts and I'd happily ship you a
servo and a power adapter from my collection of parts. If you're
interested, I'll need a shipping address so I can get those on their way to
you.

 lets the Crowbox&#39;s Arduino finish closing the lid that isn&#39;t actua=

es on at this time and blinks a number of times to indicate which training =
phase you have switched to. Press this a few times until the LED only blink=

power down the Crowbox, reverse the positive and negative servo connections=

/p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Hi Jay- thanks for doing those diagnostics. =
Another batch of stuff eliminated. This still leaves a bunch of ideas for t=
roubleshooting. The most recent video you sent was very helpful, and demons=
trates behavior from the Crowbox that was worse than I thought.</p><div><p =
class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Is it corre=
ct that to make this most recent video, you just turned on the camera, then=
 turned on the Crowbox and did nothing else? All on its own, the Crowbox ju=
st keeps blinking that light and moving the servo?</p></div><div><p class=
=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">The LED that is =
blinking should only blink when you change the training phase by pressing t=
he little button that is installed on the breadboard. I&#39;d like for you =
to disable this button and try running your Crowbox again. Just unplug the =
Crowbox from power and pull that button out of the breadboard. Or, perhaps =
better, just pull one of this button&#39;s jumper wires out of the breadboa=
rd. In your build these wires are blue and green, it doesn&#39;t matter whi=
ch you unplug, just be sure the conductive end of the jumper you remove doe=
sn&#39;t touch any of the other wires or conductive components. Then power =
up your Crowbox again.=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p=
></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">As you&#39;ve seen on YouTube, the corre=
ct Crowbox Lid starting sequence should look like this if you watch/listen =
to the servo:</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p =
class=3D"MsoNormal">-Lid moves from whatever position it may be in to the h=
alf-open position</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">-There&#39;s a pause=
, then lid pulls to fully-open position</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal=
">-There&#39;s a pause, then lid closes in 15 tiny steps (try to count the =
servo pulses if your lid is not installed- there should be 15 pulses if thi=
s operation completes)</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">-Servo becomes =
still</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">-NOTE: Depending on which traini=
ng phase the box is actually in, the lid may at this point pull to the full=
y-open position and THEN the servo will become still.=C2=A0</p></div><div><=
p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">But the i=
mportant thing we&#39;re looking for is that we get those 15 servo steps/pu=
lses. This would mean the lid was able to properly close without being inte=
rrupted by whatever is currently tripping your Crowbox over and over. If we=
 see this normal behavior we can suspect a bad/shorted switch or perhaps th=
at the switch is improperly installed, or that somehow the switch in use is=
 pinned-out differently than the switches from the batch all Crowbox protot=
ypes were built with. All of these are simple to fix.</p></div><div><p clas=
s=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you still ha=
ve problems after this, power down your Crowbox again and also disconnect o=

gain to see how it behaves with the Perch Switches and the Training Phase s=
witch disabled.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><=
p class=3D"MsoNormal">After this we&#39;re going to have to look at power p=

 to get ahead on this issue, can you send me any specs you have on the serv=
o you installed? A link to the page where you bought it, or a datasheet wou=

Hi Jay- happy to help. I wish I could have gotten to you sooner, but let&#3=

vo and the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affect=
ed a couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards=
 are of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with =
some of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap t=
he board, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"Mso=

ould check a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, or rule it out=
 and look for another cause. I know of two builds which had power supply is=
sues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;=
t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t really be abl=
e to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order you described.</p><=

iv><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">First, a fact a=
bout servo operation: When the servo first starts to move, it can pull a de=
cent amount of current. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a pro=
blem with the power supply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#3=
9; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when th=
e Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid all the way op=
en then step-close it. This could explain why your lid behaves the way it d=
oes.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=

v><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div>=
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">1) If you are running y=
our electronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via=
 USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can onl=
y pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enoug=
h to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p>=
</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></=
div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">2) Make sure t=
he power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only r=
equires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 8=
00 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If =
there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which i=
s why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s p=
lenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"m=
argin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mar=
gin-left:33.6pt">3) If you are already using a power supply, and the power =
supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your fri=
end, as well. Of the two power supply-related problems I know of, one perso=
n was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a bran=

 summary, I got the Crowbox assembled to the point of the function test, an=
d it seemed to be working properly=E2=80=A6 but in the second, third, and f=
ourth stages, it sporadically closes too fast (after only a second or two) =
and continues to partially open and close a few times before settling into =
position. It doesn=E2=80=99t do this every time, but it=E2=80=99s more ofte=
n than not. It also takes the servo quite a long time to settle down when s=
tarting up or switching modes, much longer than it seems to take for others=
 (like several minutes). </p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:0.=

u, because I know you&#39;ve already done this- Josh sends me a lot of supp=

now exactly what your situation is. So if you could explain your problem an=
d/or point me to some existing posts in the Crowbox group so that I can cat=
ch up and devise a troubleshooting strategy, that would be very helpful. If=
 I recall correctly, you have a problem we haven&#39;t seen before so our o=
ff-the-shelf solutions won&#39;t help you.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNor=
