 Glad to hear I'd left such an impression on Jeffrey. :)
Weird that it shows 1am as available - normally it shows 3-5pm GMT (8-10 PS=
T). That said, next week is probably better as this week we're moving to a =
farmhouse down the road (with fiber for internet!!), or suggest a time that=
 works for you.=C2=A0

Hello again Josh,=C2=A0
Sorry for the delay.=C2=A0 Hectic week.=C2=A0 By coincidence, Jeffrey was i=

Should I assume from your calendar that 8:00am GMT (1:00am PT) on Thursday =
is the only time available this week?=C2=A0 Thursday appeared to be the onl=
y day open and when clicked, only 8:00 came up.=C2=A0 Based on your previou=

=C2=A0 If so, I'll take a look at next week, just let me know.=C2=A0

 Well now I'm really intrigued - normally there's not quite so many gating =
mechanisms! How about a zoom call just to compare notes and catch up? The w=
hole purpose of this outreach was to find folks I could help or collaborate=
 with, so why not see what we're both working on? If nothing else I'd like =
to find out what your name is. :)
If that works, I've got a calendar here - or feel free to suggest a time th=
at works GMT.

Really, really wanted to say something clever after that Grandmaster Flash =
comment, but everything sounded like I was either trying to be hip hop, or =
pornography.=C2=A0
So instead, how about you ping me when you get back from CA and we set up a=
 time? As I understand it you've got an interest in the emerging panopticon=
 that is our modern technolopolitical first world society. I've done a lot =
of work setting up and breaking down parts of it and would be curious what =
you think!

Pleasure to meet you! I once got a draw from a grand master, but he was alm=
ost too drunk to walk. Same principle, presumably. Would love to get togeth=
er for some chess or otherwise; we've got a new baby so will probably miss =
the 4th, but am happy to connect after. What times are good for you?
Jeff, thanks for the intro!! Moving you to bcc to spare you the logistics.

Richard,
I was sharing a beer with Josh this week and mentioned to him your new play=
.=C2=A0 As I mentioned to you in the past, Josh has just turned in his manu=
script for a book on Reputation in a digital world.=C2=A0 I am probably not=

Josh,
Richard is a dear friend of about 10 years, brilliant writer, philosopher a=

Have fun, you two.

Don't know anything about you other than it seems you are a writer as well,=
 but Jeffrey's a fairly reliable source for recommendations.&nbsp; If you'd=
 like to have a conversation in person, let me know.&nbsp; Also, my wife an=
d I will be at the Fourth of July festivities at the Chelsea Piers 'Wichcra=

r chess, I'll bring you up to date on our record when I see you.&nbsp; I'll=
 give you a hint in the meantime.
 &nbsp;Over the course of ten years, one of us has won only one game, and t=
he other guy, the older guy, was drunk when that happened.&nbsp; If you pla=
y, I'm always up for a game. &nbsp;</div><div>
