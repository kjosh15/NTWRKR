Hey yo!

I?m currently working as a creative director for the largest weed company
in the US. So, there?s that...

We are rapidly expanding our Creative Studio and are looking for multiple
people to fill multiple roles. Because of regulations, we can only hire
folks based in the US. Otherwise location doesn?t matter.

We?re looking for:

? 3D/Motion Graphics Artists
? Art Directors
? Project Manager
? Producers

*Please respond to coleorloff@gmail.com <coleorloff@gmail.com>. Subject
line should be the JOB TITLE and YOUR NAME with a link to your portfolio,
day rate, phone number, and a good time to chat in the next week in the
body. *

I?d love to hook some people up with long-term contracts.

Big hugs,
Cole

Seems like a great opportunity for a great org.

Project managers - must maintain high Level 10,000 foot view for leadership

Developers - must be able to get into the weeds

Art directors - bonus points if you know how to get a creative time even
more creative

Producers - must be comfortable with lots of product testing and various
iterations. Will Help harvest talent from various disciplines to build high
performing teams.

Hi,

I'm an optimist, and sometimes self-described realist.  I've found myself
happily surprised that kids going to school hasn't yet brought a
gigantic wave of corona virus cases...  But that's not why i am writing...

Jonathan Swerdloff, with a surprisingly difficult name to spell, brought up
the Supreme Court, and I want to float an optimistic theory that you guys
can all crush down.

I think the Supreme Court self equalizes. They play roles in their 9 seats
and sometimes those roles have to change.  With the loss of RGB, and the
eventual appointment of Amy, someone on the conservative side will start
leaning more liberal.  Or judges will do the surprise swing vote or they
strike down the cases before they get to court.

Why do I think that?  Because Roe VS Wade is supported by a lot more than
50% of the country and I don't think the court wants to move us to move
starkly against the wishes of the populace.

Ok, how naive is that?

In Portland the federal agents just straight up murdered a (white, male)
suspect outside his own home, execution-style for being anti-fascist and
the President just bragged about it in today?s rally speech.

The Supreme Court just ok?d stopping the most chaotic Census in living
memory that will help determine Congressional districts across the country.

Didn?t you see Lindsey Graham today saying that it?s great that Judge Amy
is so pro-life as he stood in the Senate and illegality asked for campaign
donations?

I think we might be past the point of normality and equalisation. Now it?s
a question of how much more broken things become, and what it will look
like when the pieces are put back together in some kind of order.

Of all of the questions she didn?t answer, one that she really expounded
upon was just how much judges don?t care about public opinion.

Sorry, but I think we?re pretty fucked.

Oh Wise List,

I just moved into a new place and I?m in the process of getting internet
service set up. I?m tentatively interested in signing up for NYC Mesh
instead of Optimum, but wanted to see if anyone else had experience with
them, positive or negative. Seems rad but wanna make sure it?s reliable
etc.

Thanks!

Max

PS I?m in Bed-Stuy by Herbert Von King Park if anyone else lives in the
area and wants to hang out or whatever.

To hell with all of these people. Both sides are one and the same. 

We legitimize this by acknowledging only the two parties as legitimate via their primaries, conventions, and debates. All it does is lock us into this broken system. 

The good guys and the bad guys in WWE all work for the same company (and it?s also not real). Every binary decision we make every election has the same end result (someone from one of the two parties gets to stay or move into office). 

Say what you will, but it states not in our constitution that you must be nominated or hold a primary or a convention in order to put forth a candidate for any office. 

Stop giving them your money and your eyeballs and maybe things will change. Don?t believe you are on the right side because it?s us vs them not red vs blue. 

It will continue to be 100% purple unless we demand change with our choices. Please don?t tell me that I am wasting my vote or helping the other side. FOMO helps keep us locked into binary choices.

End rant. 

Michael Ricca

Natakallam has Persian/Farsi as part of their online one on one language
tutoring program. I used the service a couple of years ago when I was
studying Arabic.

I know some NYC Mesh folks. And can connect you with them if you'd like.
I'm not in NYC so I can't speak to the actual service.

I tried to get nyc mesh while living near herbert von king and it didn?t work out. They didn?t have service set up in the area and were going to install on our roof but only if the other people in the building would use if as well, which we couldn?t get our neighbors to agree to. If you know anyone else near you it would definitely help your cause to get them on board!

Hi Michael,

I'm sorry, but if you really believe there's no difference between the two
parties you are blind, ignorant, or deluded.  Rail as much as you want
against the two party system we have, but we are less than a hair's breadth
away from a one-party state. The Republicans have been actively corrupting
all our institutions to perpetuate their complete lock on power, and the
Democrats and any other party you might want to support will soon have no
role but as window-dressing, merely to maintain the illusion of a democracy.

You can keep your ideals, my friend, but if you want to change the system,
you have to first make sure there is a system left to change.  If you have
been listening at all you would realize that the Republican party under
McConnell and Trump will very happily take away your right to vote
entirely, and shoot you dead in the street if you complain about it.  Don't
be a chump.

David

One side is kleptocrats actively working to prolong a genuine plague, has
literal concentration camps on the border, and is working to strip
Americans of their civil rights (voting, privacy, equality) while that side
is propped up by foreign dictators and the other side is not doing
literally any of those things.

The idea that there?s anyone who genuinely believes both sides are the
same? everything I have to say here is less polite or charitable than what
David said and I endorse every word of what he said.

And since I was mentioned by name - the answer to the original question is
that yes, unfortunately, Jeff, you are na?ve if you think that those on the
court care what more than half the population think.

It?s a hallmark of autocrats to debauch and then destroy the judiciary.
Courts and laws can stop autocrats, so they do everything they can to
destroy them.  Why do you think the Republicans put 200 judges on the
federal bench?  Because they don?t care about the will of the people.

The sooner Americans realize that all that is left in the Republican party
are people who saw Russia?s oligarchs and said ?I want me some of that? the
sooner we?ll be able to face them.

If you want an accurate perspective, Sarah Kendzior?s book, Hiding in plain
sight, explains everything clearly and accurately.  You can tell how clear
and accurate it is by her predictive power of actions of the administration
about which she has an incredible track record.  The book should come with
a warning: reading the book will make you stop sleeping until these
traitors are out of power and locked up.  If you can?t stomach that much
evil, her twitter account is still worth a follow - @sarahkendzior

Jonathan S, by name, yes - I?ve listened to Sarah Kendzior. Yes, I?ve read her texts. And - yes - through her work I became more tuned in to the importance of intensive journalism to any sort of intellectual lifestyle.

I say all of this to you as someone born and raised in democrat voting nuclear family and who, like many others, started to feel my political voice when Bernie Sanders starting talking at the 2016 presidential primary debates.

Through this process of politicization, I moved - importantly - from Sarah Kendzior?s work to the work of people like?Mark Ames?and?Yasha Levine?who had covered Russian politics throughout the 1990s and early 2000?s via an independent publication by the name of?Exiled.

Through their work, which among other things makes it clear that the Russian Oligarchs became Oligarchs through massive U.S. operations and tampering (primarily with and through Boris Yeltsin) with the Post-Soviet Russian State that leveled it via???shock therapy? economic policies. These policies decimated the Russian working classes and gave rise to an oligarchic class that ran rampant until the rise of Vladimir Putin who, although brutally, reestablished State control and increased the quality of life for the majority of Russians. The creation of an Oligarchy in Russia was an intentional goal of U.S. foreign policy. As with so many other dynamics in modern history, the U.S.is a root cause and not a ?shocked? bystander.

To take the view that the DNC is favorable to the GOP is to fail to take the time and to undergo the pain and cognitive dissonance of recognizing that the function of the DNC is principally to resorb and suppress progressive movements.

By moving from Kendzior to Ames and Levine I was exposed to the degree to which the Russia Gate events, as told through the corporately controlled media organs, where largely sourced from unreliable sources. The Russia Gate narrative has served its strategic role as a spectacle through which Trump?s assent was flaccidly blamed on a Russophobic fantasy that re-mythologized the American Intelligence Apparatus - an apparatus responsible for untold slaughters of peoples across South America and the world to this day - as a bearer of any fucking sort of moral, ethical, or virtuous standard let alone a figure worthy of trust.

Trump is dangerous. There is no doubt. Americans are dangerous, there is even less doubt. As Mark Ames and his podcast ?The War Nerd? co-host Gary Brechner put it: "40% of the American public would be happy to call in an airstrike on their own neighborhood". Armed extra-judicial death squads of Trump inspired nationalists - who will not be intervened upon by police forces - are a real fucking concern, particularly in rural towns and cities. But to suppose that Trump?s presidency and its Russian affiliation is the determining cause of the rising threat of hot violence in the U.S. as well as of Major conflict internationally would reflect a selfishly tenuous grasp on real politics and an evident fear of really politicizing oneself.

If your rallying cry is ?blue no matter who? then the greatest triumph you can do for your self is to open up the socio-political bubble from which you were born and to climb out of it like a fucking Alien and breath in the fresh cold air of the U.S. empire?s lint-filled underbelly.

Rail as much as you want against the two party system we have, but we are less than a hair's breadth away from a one-party state. The Republicans have been actively corrupting all our institutions to perpetuate their complete lock on power, and the Democrats and any other party you might want to support will soon have no role but as window-dressing, merely to maintain the illusion of a democracy.

Love the discussion. 
The US can be terrible.  The fall of the USSR was many many things.  

 I really love this idea to change voting in the United States with specific innovations to enhance competition, better serve the public, including nonpartisan primary elections and ranked-choice voting. 

Rank choice voting.  We should do that NOW.

Blurb of podcast here. 

Katherine Gehl, a former CEO and the founder of the Institute for Political Innovation, and Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, apply his Five Forces framework to explain why U.S. politics are dysfunctional. They argue that the Republican and Democratic parties make up an industry duopoly with high barriers to entry and low consumer power, and that the resulting lack of competition incentivizes these two dominant players to avoid compromises with majority support. Gehl and Porter provide specific innovations on how to enhance competition and better serve the public, including nonpartisan primary elections and ranked-choice voting. Gehl and Porter are coauthors of the new book ?The Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and Save Our Democracy? and the HBR article ?Fixing U.S. Politics."

In its purest form, voting is an act of self-expression.

In the current moment, it?s an act of power.

Forgive me?but this right now is triage.

There will be an opportunity for discussion. It will probably again be
usurped by whatever system we presume. I naively hope that?s not the case.

But this is all hands-on-deck. If you can?t see that AND you care about
humanity?then just be silent. Sit this out. Wait a couple weeks
(hopefully). But philosophical discourse at this particular moment is a
luxury.

Vote. Then let?s talk.

Biden is obviously a complete joke?as is the Democratic Party writ large.

But if you cannot see what this moment represents, then sit down and shut
the fuck up. You can wait a few weeks to speak your piece.

Whatever you do, don?t get Optimum.
They?ve been charging us for 2 months for services we didn?t request that
add up to $400 a month (our bill should had been for $70/month). It took us
a month of long phone calls -were 90% of the people didn?t know what to- do
to get it solved (we still don?t know if it?s solved tbh). We have had
several weeks without internet also and they don?t do shit about it and
don?t offer discounts for service outage. Just don?t get optimum.

The 'they are all the same' argument is my least favorite statement. It's a
particular form of voter suppression. If you think they are all the same
you are less likely to vote. Plain and simple. It seems very effective with
those who have the least to lose. If your human rights aren't being
threatened by the current admin then yea it's easy to think 'they are all
the same'. And let's be real empires and imperialism aren't new things but
that's a different convo.

Overall, I don't know whether to be terrified or hopeful. I'm both. I see
the real and clear danger. Then I see signs of hope but maybe for cynical
reasons. Mostly because it isn't in businesses interests to have a
completely destabilized US. There are hints of some Republicans growing a
spine because their careers (and money) are on the line now. The other
group that could push trump out if he refuses to leave, are the governors.
Pretty sure many of them have had enough of him even many of the Republican
governors.

Heya m'list!

I know many of you fine people are musicians, so I figured I would give you
the first look at this list of instruments and gear that we are selling out
of our Beirut storage space at CMS in Prospect Heights. Let me know off
list if you are interested in anything. I will be selling this stuff until
the end of October, so if it isn't marked sold, it is still available!

Cheers,

I get that so many people are upset with both choices. For those of you who
are on the fence, It all comes down to a simple question. Who out of these
two candidates is going to move the needle towards the ideals so many of us
espouse?

Drumpf and his draconian goons are certainly not going to give any more
rights to anyone who is not a member of the white 1%. If you want change,
be a realist. The pathway to change in this entire country will be slow and
arduous and will drive you absolutely bonkers. But getting change will only
happen when you make more people involved. In this election, a simple
pragmatic decision is all you need.

A Biden/Harris win will create better opportunities for everyone to work
together to build the results we want. Incremental steps are not the enemy
of progress, indecision and not paying attention are.

Please vote.

>>>>> Katherine Gehl, a former CEO and the founder of the Institute for
>>>>> Political Innovation, and Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business
>>>>> School, apply his Five Forces framework to explain why U.S. politics are
>>>>> dysfunctional. They argue that the Republican and Democratic parties make
>>>>> up an industry duopoly with high barriers to entry and low consumer power,
>>>>> and that the resulting lack of competition incentivizes these two dominant
>>>>> players to avoid compromises with majority support. Gehl and Porter provide
>>>>> specific innovations on how to enhance competition and better serve the
>>>>> public, including nonpartisan primary elections and ranked-choice voting.
>>>>> Gehl and Porter are coauthors of the new book ?The Politics Industry: How
