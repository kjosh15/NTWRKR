Below are a few of my current projects, or just hit me with an update on =
what you're working on. I=E2=80=99m curious to hear how I can help!

All best wishes,

###

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for =
measuring behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful for newly remote =
staff, this gives employees clear measures of where and how to improve.

; a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce =
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid=
!)

: as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on =
technology strategy and new innovation / product development.

=20

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this outreach, there is a =
whitepaper .
