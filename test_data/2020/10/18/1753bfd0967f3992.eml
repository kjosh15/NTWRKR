Making sure this didn't fall through the cracks - since the pandemic all =
the time we've saved on commuting seems to have been immediately absorbed =
by zoom sessions. Let me know if you're game for one more!

All best,

A big part of that seems to be figuring out who =
you can help in the first place. I=E2=80=99d like to get around that by =
connecting with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; =
reply with an update on your own stuff, or schedule a time(https://calendly=

Looking forward to =
reconnecting,
