Did I just see on LinkedIn that you recently got an awesome new position?
Let me know if you're available to catch up - I'm in Iceland atm but since
the pandemic have doubled down on trying to connect with all the good folks
I've worked with over the years. I'd be curious to hear where you've been
and what you're doing since we last spoke!

All best,
Josh
