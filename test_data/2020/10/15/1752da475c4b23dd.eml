Yes, everything is fine.
Corona period.  Things move slowly.  I stopped with the crows box and when
we get in school, I will give the project to my fellow teacher.  Her
students are already waiting to continue with the fascinating experiment.
I left teaching for research at Tel Aviv University.  Ph.d in zoology,
insect researcher.  Mole Cricket...
I saw what you send few weeks ago and i still think about it.
 I'll be in touch
Take care dear
Avi.

Hi dear Josh,=C2=A0<div dir=3D"auto">I would like to consult with you about=
 a certain part of the crowbox. They accidentally cut off the 4 pieces that=
 appear in the pictures from hard material. I went to the factory and asked=
 to cut new from a flexible material that could curl and not break. They br=
ought me soft but transparent material. Do you think I should paint it so i=
t will not be transparent? Or it does not matter cause the peanuts will be =
on it and hide that it is transparent. Thank you.=C2=A0</div><div dir=3D"au=
