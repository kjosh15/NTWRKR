Just wanted to loop back around to see if you're game for reconnecting.
I've recently moved to Iceland through the new year, and the view from here
on the EU/US markets is fascinating. The potential for radical new services
at Mastercard has never been richer - let me know if you're game to briefly
connect and compare notes in the weeks ahead!

All best wishes,
Josh
