Amy,

I know it's been five years since we last spoke during your event and then
thereafter, but there's been a lot that's progressed since then, especially
in my work on the use of data for measuring employee engagement and
alignment to core values. Do you have time in the next couple weeks to
catch up on the challenges of human capital management in a pandemic and
beyond?

All best,
Josh
