Happy to do it, but irritated that we've exhausted so many options. We're
basically down to a bad servo or a bad power supply. We've seen erratic
behavior like this from other users and both had bad power supplies. Too
bad Jay has run two different power supplies (his and his friends) and gets
the same result. I hope he takes me up on letting me mail him a servo and a
power supply because we're pretty much out of obvious options and it's
looking a lot like something that's out of our control. i.e., bad
components.

 you were able to switch to Phase One. This tells me that there&#39;s no pr=

to do is follow the red and brown wires to the breadboard and reverse their=

own and red wires (at the breadboard) and power back up. Let me know what y=

 Thirty seconds after you boot up the Crowbox, press the Training Phase but=
ton on the Breadboard. I just want to verify that the LED comes on at this =
time and blinks a number of times to indicate which training phase you have=
 switched to. Press this a few times until the LED only blinks one time ins=
tead of issuing a sequence of blinks (I want you to return the Crowbox to P=
hase One training). I expect that you&#39;ll be able to do this without tro=
uble.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><d=

connect your servo. Then boot up the Crowbox again. PROBABLY you will see t=
hat the Crowbox misbehaves in the way that it has been misbehaving. I don&#=

<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">IF your Crowbox misbehaves, I want you to try o=
ne more thing: Reverse the POSITIVE and NEGATIVE connections for the Servo =
on the breadboard. This is a hail mary but it&#39;s worth trying before we =
move on. So, power down the Crowbox, reverse the positive and negative serv=
o connections and power up again. Please let me know in detail what you see=
 when you power up the Crowbox like this. If there is no improvement, swap =
the servo wires again to restore it to the way you had it originally wired =

 you said you&#39;ve also tried your friend&#39;s servo and your friend&#39=

 while but it happens. Two bad components seems unlikely but certainly not =
impossible. In any event, we may need to ship you some components that have=

Crowbox again. Just unplug the Crowbox from power and pull that button out =
of the breadboard. Or, perhaps better, just pull one of this button&#39;s j=
umper wires out of the breadboard. In your build these wires are blue and g=
reen, it doesn&#39;t matter which you unplug, just be sure the conductive e=
nd of the jumper you remove doesn&#39;t touch any of the other wires or con=
ductive components. Then power up your Crowbox again.=C2=A0</p></div><div><=
p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">As you&#3=

 why the lid enters the startup pattern of pulling to half-way,=C2=A0then f=

wer supply issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rul=
e that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds =
which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo =
behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software sh=

to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the system is underpowe=
red, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, this current su=
rge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it to reb=
oot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do is pu=
ll the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could explain why your=
 lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D=

>1) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connec=
ted to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power sup=
ply. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connecti=
on and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts =
can happen this way.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-l=

pply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull s=
pikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;=
s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can =
pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to=
 make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=

ower supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping p=
ower supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related pr=
oblems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and =
the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and did=

ld explain your problem and/or point me to some existing posts in the Crowb=
ox group so that I can catch up and devise a troubleshooting strategy, that=
 would be very helpful. If I recall correctly, you have a problem we haven&=
