We met at one of Laurel Touby's dinners ages ago in 2013, and then
reconnected again briefly in 2015. I'm trying to find all the smart,
interesting people I've worked with over the years and am doubling down on
working with them alone. If the pandemic has shown me anything it's that
life is too short for assholes. Let me know if you're around for a brief
call in the weeks ahead!

All best,
Josh
