It's been a while since I introduced your fiance to Village Capital back in
2013 - what are you working on now?? I see you're at Happy Fun Corp - very
curious to hear how that's going and/or what your approach to JV/corporate
partnerships is (most of my work these days is on retainer to be corps on
tech strategy/product dev.) Let me know if you have time in the next couple
weeks to catch up!

All best,
Josh
