Ann,

Haven't spoken to you since Chris Fabian introduced us in 2010 (time
flies...). Let me know if you have time for a brief reconnect in the weeks
ahead - I'm very keen to see how I can help folks doing meaningful work out
in the world and am sitting in an interesting position here in Iceland,
consulting on retainer to a variety of executives on both sides of the pond
and all of them trying to figure out what they need to do to thrive going
forward. Would love to get your feedback.

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
