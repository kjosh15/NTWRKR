Haven't talked since my call for podcast support, but you came so highly
recommended I wanted to loop back around. Let me know if you're up for
comparing notes on your industry; I'm still hearing interesting rumblings
from my corporate contacts and am curious to hear from you how best to
approach them as they start making decisions for 2021!!

All best wishes,
Josh
