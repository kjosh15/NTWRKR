More seriously, how the heck is NYC these days? Are you still there? We
zipped off to Iceland mid-June and keep stalling our return. It's beautiful
here, but it's certainly not Jackson Heights.

Let me know if you're game for a brief reconnect to compare notes, and all
best wishes to you and your family in the meantime!!

All best,
Josh
