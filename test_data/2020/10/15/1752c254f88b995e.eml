Let me know what you're up to and what you're building now - the pandemic
seems to have lit a fire under the OTT universe and the possibility for new
content is booming. Also and FWIW, I'm currently in Iceland, so if you need
a safe place to shoot this is it!! Let me know if you're game to briefly
reconnect in the weeks ahead to compare notes.

All best,
Josh
