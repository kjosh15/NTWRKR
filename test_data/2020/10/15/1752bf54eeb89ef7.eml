I know we haven't spoken since just after the GLC in 2011, but I'm quite
keen to reconnect and learn more about what you're working on. Recent
events have made it clear that a multinational perspective requires active,
deliberate outreach and I'm eager to make connections in your region. I'm
currently in Iceland with a number of clients in New York. Are you
available to briefly connect and compare notes in the weeks ahead?

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
