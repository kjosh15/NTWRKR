Joshua,

It seems to me, from listening to you, that you are following in my footstep=
s and trying to get really sour bread. Don=E2=80=99t. I went down this rabbi=
t hole and eventually realized that I had a lot of bread making to learn abo=
ut first. I now know that when it=E2=80=99s really sour it is also very diff=
icult to time the rise properly. I decided it would be better to learn basic=
s first and then come back to sour sourdough.=20

I hope your pizza dinner worked out. I would suggest that next time you loos=
e your starter that you start a new one ASAP. It takes about 2 weeks (of dai=
ly feeding) to get a starter to its full potential, so one or two days will l=
eave you in a hole.=20

Lastly, please check out Bread Code on YouTube. Take the 29 minutes and at l=
east watch his, =E2=80=9C4 Tips to greatly improve your starter=E2=80=9D. Ma=
ny of his other videos are also well worth watching, but given where you are=
 in your bread making, at least watch this one:

https://youtu.be/yYkTrGHNW2w

I learned a lot watching this one - even after all the time I=E2=80=99ve bee=
n at it.=20

Let me know how the pizzas worked out.=20

Love,
DAD
