Anna Hildur,

Curious about your near term plans given how precarious Iceland seems
atm... and the UK.

Separately, I recently spoke with some friends of mine in the Pirate Party
and was advised that the Kria fund has strong governmental support and a
burning dumpster fire of bureaucratic underpinnings. The Minister of
Finance is who I'm supposed to talk to, but I figured that if anyone had
carefully constructed plans for engagement / rescue it would be you. Do
you, and if so how can I help?

All best wishes,
Josh
=E1=90=A7
