This is going viral online so you may have already seen it, but it is far
and away the most cogent and understandable summary of how the virus
actually spreads that I've seen yet. Worth sharing with folks that seem
confused about the topic:

the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html?ssm=3DTW_CC

Note that according to the European Center for Disease Control and
Prevention=E2=80=99s (ECDC) there are as yet no documented cases of COVID-1=
9 being
spread from touching a surface.
