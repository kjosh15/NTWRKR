Thanks for the call earlier; as usual I left much enlightened. I&#39;ll che=
ck out Northstack and connect w/ Jokull via Signal (thanks for the intro!);=
 in the meantime next week is looking a little packed for me to be useful. =
Given that you&#39;ve got a year-long timeline anyway, can we push to the w=
eek after to meet and discuss board seats in Iceland (and beyond)? Maybe No=
v 10 and 10am GMT?<br>
