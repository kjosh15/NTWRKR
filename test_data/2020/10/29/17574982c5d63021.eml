This all makes sense, is cogent and concise, and seems well grounded in
reality and what we have achieved so far. In that regard it in no way
resembles any silicon-valley style pitch I've ever read. ;)

Seriously though, I think the point is useful: most US VC-style pitches
project assumptions about an unproven market in changing conditions for
which significant funding is needed to test and validate said assumptions,
with success resulting in massive and significant upside.

For IndigoMetrics, I think our position needs to be that we're hitting
those kinds of changing market conditions, but we're doing so with an
established platform, prevalidated value, and an existing set of customer
case studies to create confidence in new buyers. The changing conditions
mean that a big, established brand can essentially take IndigoMetrics off
the shelf and carve out an entirely new market which to date has only
produced bad, qualitative data.

To that end we need to demonstrate

   1. why IndigoMetrics is different from all our competitors,
   2. how its growth path provides a big established player  with an
   ongoing moat against incumbents AND new features/services to continue to
   roll out over time, and
   3. how it accelerates existing services and extends their ROI lifespan.

If we can do that - while also identifying clear, reliable evidence that
the existing market has substantially changed in our favor - I think we
have a  clear case for a strategic investment/acquisition at rates well
beyond what the material you wrote here would indicate. Does that make
sense?
