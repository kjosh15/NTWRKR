We're having another next week, and I was going to reach out before hand to
whoever we thought might be valuable to Indigo about doing a "coffee chat"
to simulate the casual meetings that we're missing since going virtual.

Who of the below do you see as being potentially useful to Indigo given our
current stance on partnerships? Put another way, I don't want to spam
everyone, but could ping a quarter of these without feeling too bad about
it.

best,
Josh
