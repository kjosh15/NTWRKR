Talked Harry into doing one more redesign to make it less PPT-y. He'll
revert EOD tomorrow and hand over all three versions as exports; I'll take
those and replace what we have now, and going forward we can multivariate
test the messaging on it when/if we think appropriate.

First stop is getting a good video on the front page, though. :)
