As requested, for color:

- My first (and only) mainstage TED talk
<https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_klein_a_thought_experiment_on_the_intelli=
gence_of_crows?language=3Den>
and the ongoing project <https://www.thecrowbox.com> it spawned. Figured
I'd start with this as it's the weirdest and most tangential.

- My first (and favorite) book
<https://www.amazon.com/Rood-Joshua-Klein/dp/1434844005/ref=3Dsr_1_1?ie=3DU=
TF8&qid=3D1319649910&sr=3D8-1>;
licensing Creative Commons made it the first modern novel on the iPhone,
which led to a book deal with Amazon's print on demand service. I still get
royalties from this one.

- A list of past projects <https://www.josh.is/hacking/>. More than my
successes, this will give you insight into the kinds of projects I've tried
for fun. (Although I like to think my successes show this also - just that
there are fewer of them!)

There's also some TV work
<https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5134902/?ref_=3Dfn_nm_nm_1>, lots of public
speaking/writing ("thought leadership" as it's frequently mislabeled), a
business consulting/coaching career, a startup (soon to be seeking
strategic acquisition) and an unrelated healthtech project (aimed at
solving for diabetes, heart disease, and obesity). But those are better
covered as diversions.

Let me know if you're around for a conversation in a week or two,
Josh
