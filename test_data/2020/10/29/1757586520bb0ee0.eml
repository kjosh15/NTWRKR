Dear Friends and Family,

Things are going well here with us.  Eric is walking without crutches and
getting stronger every day.  We are back in lockdown due to a surge in
cases.  The goal of the government is to reduce the numbers so that people
can be together with their families for Christmas.  We are a bit skeptical
as there seems to be a collective denial that children can spread Covid and
the schools are remaining open.  One thing we are all learning from this
virus is how heavily the economy relies on the school systems functioning.

Last week was our vacation week. We had planned on travelling around the
country and looking at houses but lockdown changed our plans and restricted
us to Dublin County.  Instead, we stayed in the Clontarf Castle for a few
nights and Fitzpatrick Castle for a few nights.  So, we had a different
great time!

Driving Around

Having a car has been amazing, especially with the weather changing and the
limitations of movement we are living with as Eric recovers and bus travel
is restricted to essential workers.  In Ireland, there are three
=E2=80=9Cmedallions=E2=80=9D that are required to be displayed on the winds=
hield of your
car, a verification of road worthiness, a proof of taxes paid and a proof
of insurance.  It took us a while to successfully obtain the insurance but
I am happy to report that we finally succeeded and now all three
achievements have been unlocked and our car meets all legal requirements.

We were able to visit the Dublin Zoo before the latest round of
restrictions and were impressed with both the exhibits and the way that
they managed the human traffic.  We had to reserve a time to visit in
advance as they only allow a certain amount of humans in at a time and they
developed a one-way route through the zoo.  It was well thought out and we
had a great time watching the chimpanzees groom and the seals play.  We
were also able to explore Tymon Park, a 300 acre nature area that spans the
M50, the major highway around Dublin, with two foot bridges.

The Castle Experience

As mentioned, our plans were rerouted due to the Covid and we found
ourselves half-way between here and Howth in the Clontarf area for a couple
nights.  We highly recommend staying at the Clontarf Castle if you ever get
the chance! There was modern art through out the castle to visit, the
accommodations were magnificent and the food was delectable.  Our favorite
experience in the castle was having an afternoon cocktail in the dungeon or
what used to be the dungeon before being converted into a cozy little
sitting area.  Clontarf is also close to St. Anne=E2=80=99s park, previous =
home of
the Guinness family, which we were excited to explore again.  This time we
went to the walled garden and perused the medicine garden and the Chinese
garden.  We also had a nice walk around the grounds enjoying the fall
colors and again I don=E2=80=99t want to brag too much but I got to pet two=
 dogs.

Our next stop was Fitzpatrick Castle in the Dalkey area.  It wasn=E2=80=99t=
 as
great as the previous accommodations, but we enjoyed the afternoon tea
service and Dalkey is a beautiful place to walk around.  We had a lovely
walk to the top of Killiney Park where the witch=E2=80=99s hat and the Iris=
h
pyramid are.  The next day we walked down to the town of Dalkey hoping to
run into Matt Damon who is currently staying there.  Although unsuccessful
in running into Matt, we did happen upon some great sandwiches which we
enjoyed under a tree at the old quarry.  Then we decided to walk down to
the beach which took us past Enya=E2=80=99s castle.  Some guy was power was=
hing her
drive so the gate was open and Eric was able to get a rare unobstructed
picture of the residence.  We continued down toward the beach,  taking a
right on Vico St. and this time we walked by Bono=E2=80=99s house, it is th=
e green
(bronze) gate in the pictures. If you look closely, you may be able to make
out lyrics. Right next to Bono=E2=80=99s was an alleyway which took us to t=
he
beach.   Dinner was in the Fitzpatrick Dungeon Bar.  By the way, the only
restaurants you can eat at in Ireland are those in the hotel you are
staying at as you are a resident.  This is a bit of a lockdown loophole.
The food was alright but the couple at the table next to us made the
evening spectacular, see picture.

We Count

We have both now successfully voted, and are very appreciative of
Washington=E2=80=99s system and feel fortunate to be able to track our vote=
s online
even from this distance.  We are hoping that every single legitimate vote
is counted and not suppressed by arbitrary means.  It has been
disheartening to see such an effort to cast doubt on American democracy and
so many actions taken against the fundamental pillar of ensuring free and
fair elections.  It is confusing to the people here as to why people are
having to wait in such long lines to vote and why ballot drop box locations
are being restricted.



We are wishing you all the best, stay healthy, stay safe and may the will
of the people prevail!



Much Love,



Marti and Eric
