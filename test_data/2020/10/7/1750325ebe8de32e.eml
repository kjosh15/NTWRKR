Certainly do (attached - check out the new branding!), but if there's no
appetite don't worry about flogging it. I'll keep coming around. ;)

Sorry to prompt a doomsday run. Was just curious if it resonated or if it
struck you as, indeed, bombastic hand waving. These are very very strange
times!!

Keep me posted and always happy to chat; being abroad is weirdly
dislocating, esp. here where everyone assumes we blithely walked away from
our lives and country because "Iceland is better." Very strange to find
myself suddenly and unexpectedly patriotic about the crisis in the USA!

All best wishes,
Josh
