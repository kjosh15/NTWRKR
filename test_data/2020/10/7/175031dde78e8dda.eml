n, my apologies.<br><br>&quot;A late-night program without the scorn and us=
ing repetitive, data-driven elements to ease tension between Americans&quot=
; sounds AMAZING. I&#39;m really curious to push this idea further, but you=
 had me with this line alone. <br><br>I love the idea of using AI to help b=
oth sides engage with each other. I don&#39;t suggest we try to convert the=
 other, as I expect that would offend both, but if we position it as using =
AI to help each side engage with and understand the other - especially if i=
t&#39;s about highly contentious topics - there&#39;s a very real power the=
re. After all, this is the extremist element Facebook, Twitter, etc. have a=
ll exploited to our planet&#39;s detriment. <br><br>One of the ideas here t=
hat I keep coming back to is that Americans particularly are seeing just ho=
w divided their country is, and that at a certain level there is a desire f=
or unity. If we can give voice to that - if we can have each episode close =
with two people who were diametrically opposed demonstrating how they conne=
cted over something which previously made them act hatefully towards each o=
ther - then we&#39;re giving people hope. <br><br>More than that, we&#39;re=
 giving Americans a roadmap for healing. The US has always been strong *bec=
ause* of its core values, and those values include diversity. We just need =
to be shown how we are strong in embracing that. Having an AI spell out and=
 guide us to finding that conversation - that &quot;OK, I disagree but can =
still respect you&quot; baseline value - could be enormously powerful. <br>=
<br>A few notes on format:<br><br>- If we could have two of those our AI ha=
d the conversations with here to the studio to reread their exchanges on ai=
r always featuring a reconciliation or emotionally powerful reckoning that =
would be even better, no?<br><br>- Not sure if having an expert wouldn&#39;=
t cause more divisiveness. Usually experts have a strong opinion. Or am I m=
issing the gist here?<br><br>- I love the idea of halting the show for peop=
le to vote about whether someone changes their mind, BUT this essentially p=
its everyone who participates against the AI. If the goal is to create unit=
y, then we need to leave the door open to NOT changing your mind. That need=
s to be an ok option. What needs to be non-optional is welcoming the engage=
ment with the other side. That&#39;s the part that I think has been most mi=
ssing, and is where using the AI as &quot;other&quot; could be really power=
ful. No?<br><br>- Highlighting funny interactions sounds ideal, *especially=
 where it makes people who are unwilling to engage or reconsider look fooli=
sh.* Again, if we make the focus of the program be about lauding Americans =
who are willing to engage and reconsider the &quot;other side&quot;, and pr=
oviding a narrative for average folks to do so themselves, then I think we =
have something that could run for multiple seasons.<br><br>- One other idea=
: have A-listers who do NOT fit the voice of the person who wrote one side =
of the engagement read their text. I.e., have Betty White read the text fro=
m a male black southern construction worker, or Brad Pitt read the text fro=
m an older woman from the upper east side in NYC. Having a-list talent prov=
ides all the usual draws, and would feed the pool of people who are willing=
 to engage with the bot. <br><br>Technically, it occurs to me that we could=
 just make a website where anyone could log on and engage with the bot, but=
 that this would be really easy to spam and would favor younger folks. My s=
uspicion is that email is our best bet, and that if we require people to su=
bmit a photo to start the conversation that would filter even more strongly=
 towards older and legitimate users. That&#39;s also asynchronous, which wo=
uld be easier for GPT-3 to work with. <br><br>Finally, it may also be possi=
ble for the AI to source content to feed the conversation. No idea if this =
would work well or not, but if we could train an AI to review content sent =
to it (i.e., a &quot;fake news filter&quot;) this could train people to spo=
t fake news AND give us some great comedic content. Conversely, if a bot ga=
ve you a link and asked you if you thought it mattered to the conversation =
at hand that might be less confrontational than a human being saying &quot;=
read the Wikipedia entry, asshole.&quot; Thoughts?<br><br>There&#39;s reall=
y something here, now, and I think that as a proposal it&#39;s getting pret=
ty undeniable. One last note; I&#39;m going to be a part of a summit in a m=
onth or so hosted by Trevor Noah. Might be a chance for me to get his ear (=
virtually) to pitch the idea. Do you think that&#39;s a fit?<br><br>All bes=
