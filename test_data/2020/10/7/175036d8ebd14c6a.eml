1) it might not happen and 2) it might get too cheesy too quickly. I =
think this should attempt to remain emotionally non-partisan, as well as =
politically. Let=E2=80=99s all be adults about this and perceive of our =
intensity around these issues in a way that makes them less important, =
rather than more important. Meaning, reconciliation is dependent on the =

On one hand, humor is a draw. But on the other hand, it=E2=80=99s =
divisive=E2=80=94at least, often times. There=E2=80=99s a deeper idea =
and challenge here regarding how to craft a nighttime program that =
doesn=E2=80=99t rely on negativity bias. I watch Trevor Noah because he =
is so ludicrously funny as it pertains to putting down those who don=E2=80=

doesn=E2=80=99t rely on such things, one someone would want to watch =

about the program as well. It reminds me of John Oliver=E2=80=99s push =
to get folks to visit domains he=E2=80=99s purchased for each episode. =
But there is one centralized second screen experience, one site or one =

I'm really curious to push this idea further, but you had me with this =
line alone. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">I love the idea of using AI to =
help both sides engage with each other. I don't suggest we try to =
convert the other, as I expect that would offend both, but if we =
position it as using AI to help each side engage with and understand the =
other - especially if it's about highly contentious topics - there's a =
very real power there. After all, this is the extremist element =
Facebook, Twitter, etc. have all exploited to our planet's detriment. =
<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">One of the ideas here that I keep coming =
back to is that Americans particularly are seeing just how divided their =
country is, and that at a certain level there is a desire for unity. If =
we can give voice to that - if we can have each episode close with two =
people who were diametrically opposed demonstrating how they connected =
over something which previously made them act hatefully towards each =
other - then we're giving people hope. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">More =
than that, we're giving Americans a roadmap for healing. The US has =
always been strong *because* of its core values, and those values =
include diversity. We just need to be shown how we are strong in =
embracing that. Having an AI spell out and guide us to finding that =
conversation - that "OK, I disagree but can still respect you" baseline =
value - could be enormously powerful. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">A =
few notes on format:<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- If we could have two =
of those our AI had the conversations with here to the studio to reread =
their exchanges on air always featuring a reconciliation or emotionally =
powerful reckoning that would be even better, no?<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">- Not sure if having an expert wouldn't cause more =
divisiveness. Usually experts have a strong opinion. Or am I missing the =
gist here?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- I love the idea of halting the =
show for people to vote about whether someone changes their mind, BUT =
this essentially pits everyone who participates against the AI. If the =
goal is to create unity, then we need to leave the door open to NOT =
changing your mind. That needs to be an ok option. What needs to be =
non-optional is welcoming the engagement with the other side. That's the =
part that I think has been most missing, and is where using the AI as =
"other" could be really powerful. No?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- =
Highlighting funny interactions sounds ideal, *especially where it makes =
people who are unwilling to engage or reconsider look foolish.* Again, =
if we make the focus of the program be about lauding Americans who are =
willing to engage and reconsider the "other side", and providing a =
narrative for average folks to do so themselves, then I think we have =
something that could run for multiple seasons.<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">- One other idea: have A-listers who do NOT fit the voice of =
the person who wrote one side of the engagement read their text. I.e., =
have Betty White read the text from a male black southern construction =
worker, or Brad Pitt read the text from an older woman from the upper =
east side in NYC. Having a-list talent provides all the usual draws, and =
would feed the pool of people who are willing to engage with the bot. =
<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">Technically, it occurs to me that we could =
just make a website where anyone could log on and engage with the bot, =
but that this would be really easy to spam and would favor younger =
folks. My suspicion is that email is our best bet, and that if we =
require people to submit a photo to start the conversation that would =
filter even more strongly towards older and legitimate users. That's =
also asynchronous, which would be easier for GPT-3 to work with. <br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">Finally, it may also be possible for the AI to =
source content to feed the conversation. No idea if this would work well =
or not, but if we could train an AI to review content sent to it (i.e., =
a "fake news filter") this could train people to spot fake news AND give =
us some great comedic content. Conversely, if a bot gave you a link and =
asked you if you thought it mattered to the conversation at hand that =
might be less confrontational than a human being saying "read the =
Wikipedia entry, asshole." Thoughts?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">There's =
really something here, now, and I think that as a proposal it's getting =
pretty undeniable. One last note; I'm going to be a part of a summit in =
a month or so hosted by Trevor Noah. Might be a chance for me to get his =
ear (virtually) to pitch the idea. Do you think that's a fit?<br =
