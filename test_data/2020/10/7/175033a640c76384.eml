1. How the heck are you? Sending all best wishes to you and yours in this
crazy, crazy time - i.e., pandemic, election, fires, etc. First and
foremost please let me know you're safe and healthy, and if not know I'm
wishing you all the best.

2. Apologies for disappearing. See above, reg. pandemic et all. I'm in
Iceland for the time being. :/

3. Remember that pitch to Cardi B we wanted to make? Well we finally have
something really good to get in front of her. Details below, but we're
working on a simple asset to pass over if you think we can still get it.
This time around we've got influencers (Kerry Washington, Alexis Ren, Flea,
Rosanna Arquette etc.), we've got producers, we've got a platform, and god
knows we have a clear and present need for her voice. If there was ever a
time for an A-lister to step up on to a platform this is the one.

Take a look at the below and let me know if we can get you some material to
pass over.

All best,
Josh

If we have one shot and pretty high confidence we can get it to her, i
should make an asset and send it over. i can do it tomorrow early in the
day if that works.

in the meantime, here are the assets on hand:

First, our partner deck <https://docsend.com/view/99e6vp2m69vta2dt>. All
the influencers we've attracted have come through that deck, including
Kerry Washington, Alexis Ren, Flea, Rosanna Arquette etc.

Second: the letter we've been sending to celebs in our network to try to
get them to be the spokesperson for the video:

We are writing to invite Cardi B to lend her voice and appear in
*Landslide2020*, an anti-voter suppression / voting advocacy video aimed to
arm citizens with the information they need to ensure that their vote is
counted *by election night*.

The video will cover two extremely urgent points:

   1.

   How Trump could steal the election if we don=E2=80=99t vote early *and* =
in-person
   2.

   How to use the Landslide app to make sure your voter registration is
   never purged and you have all the info you need to choose the best way t=
o
   vote so your vote is counted by election night.

We=E2=80=99d love to send you the script for your review.

The video will be under two minutes and is produced and directed by *ART
NOT WAR*
<https://j-a-bersani-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=3D177UeWFD7cb=
nU2w9PPvWXhh4kcIwuycmi-hcsXV8bLjs-1009421571&key=3DYAMMID-79444938&link=3Dh=
ttps%3A%2F%2Fartnotwar.com%2F>
(founded
by Laura Dawn, MoveOn's Creative Director for 10 years). It will be
distributed across all social media platforms and ART NOT WAR is getting it
distributed through dozens of top social justice organizations to aid in
amplification.

We are racing towards the election of our lifetime and we know that Cardi=
=E2=80=99s
time is valuable, so we are offering three simple options for capturing the
video at her comfort and convenience:

   1.

   *Socially Distant Filming  *- A crew of two COVID tested production
   staff in masks can film from a distance either in a studio or outdoors.
   2.

   *Production* *Setup Comes to You* - We can send a personless production
   setup to her home, which will include the camera and lights ready to
   capture the video.
   3.

   *Home Setup *- If Kerry has a setup at home, we are happy to accept a
   well lit, horizontally shot video no smaller than 1920x1080.

Please let me know if we can count on Cardi's participation in this
incredibly important initiative. As this is time sensitive, we will need to
know her availability by the end of the week.


Thank you kindly for your consideration,
