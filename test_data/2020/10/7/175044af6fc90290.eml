Dear Ragn=C2=ADhei=C3=B0ur,

I recognize it's past the deadline, but with 15 years' experience working
on new technology and innovation with companies large and small in the EU,
US, and Asia - and having recently moved to Iceland - I feel I bring
unusually pertinent expertise. Moreover, this position is very specifically
the kind of work I've specialized in and am eager to bring to Icelandic
businesses.

I've attached my CV and presskit and more information is available at
www.josh.is; can you please let me know if it's worth consideration?

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
