Well now I'm really intrigued - normally there's not quite so many gating
mechanisms! How about a zoom call just to compare notes and catch up? The
whole purpose of this outreach was to find folks I could help or
collaborate with, so why not see what we're both working on? If nothing
else I'd like to find out what your name is. :)

If that works, I've got a calendar here <https://josh.is/scheduling> - or
feel free to suggest a time that works GMT.

All best,
Josh
