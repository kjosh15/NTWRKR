First question is if you want to do it as fully independent, or if you are
willing to join a consultancy to build up your contact list. Second
question is if you have access to any private organizations to which you
can act as a specialist advisor; this was a tremendous leg up to me, and
honestly doesn't take much time. Third suggestion would be to identify a
vertical or industry which you feel you have specialist expertise to offer,
and then make targeted inquiries.

All of these have long lead times, unfortunately, and are complicated by
the pandemic, but conversely if you can find an underexploited niche or
approach you can make a lot of ground quickly.

Feel free to reply with any thoughts; I'm happy to bounce back and forth!

best,
Josh

    <p>Hi Josh,</p>
    <p>I think I came up with something that you can help me with: It
      might still take some time, before I hear back from Rwanda. So I
      want to see, what my possibilities are as a consultant. What would
      your first step be, if you were in my position and wanted to get
      two more customers?</p>
    <p>Looking forward to hearing how you would approach this.</p>
