Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.=
com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for autonomously managing =
behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!=20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Professional Services(http://www.josh.is): as ever, I continue to work with=
 senior leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / =
product development.=20
P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this=
 outreach, there is a whitepaper here(https://docs.google.=
com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0-BG_0/edit?=
