Doing great, doing weird. Didn't plan to move to Iceland, but are now
dismantling our apartment, moving our cats to my sister, dissolving our
lease etc. all from afar. No idea where we'll be living a year from
now, and nobody here relates to the experience of having left NYC in the
middle of a pandemic in any way. At the same time the kids are in a local
school that's all f2f, spending lots of time hiking and running around in
the woods, low risk of exposure, etc. So super super grateful, and also,
weirdly dislocated. My in-laws like to say we're the most privileged
refugees on the planet right now. :)

What about you? Any bumps due to going fully virtual, or have you been able
to keep everything moving? Curious what's good/bad/indifferent as a result!

All best,
Josh
