  Josh,

I apologize for the delay in responding. I read your white paper and have
been thinking about it along with your thesis that networking has turned
into spam.

Regarding networking, that has not been my experience in general. But, I
think that is because I'm not a target of much networking efforts any
longer since I've retired and people don't imagine they can get money,
investment, business or employment from me.

In fact, what I'm finding is quite the opposite. Every day or two I ask
myself, "I wonder if X is okay?" so I write to check in. And, I get similar
emails and they feel like people are sending me diamonds in the mail. For
example, just yesterday morning I got an email from.J=C3=A1n S=C3=A1ren=C3=
=ADk simply
asking, "How are you?"

J=C3=A1n is a Slovak who discovered my website Q54Club.org back in 2013. It
presents 54 questions to ask yourself to create a philosophy of life. He
signed up to receive my automated "question-a-day" emails. I didn't know
anything about him until I met him in person when I gave a TEDx talk in
Krakow, Poland in 2017. He found his way into the audience to thank me
personally because the discipline of answering the questions changed his
life. In 2018 he translated my questions into Slovak and Czech.

Because J=C3=A1n wrote, now I'm thinking about Jan Bleckmann from Frankfurt=
,
Germany. In 2008 I joined Xing, which is a German platform like LinkedIn
except that encouraged you to make connections with strangers. Within a
year I had about 2,200 contacts in Germany. My connections were mostly
superficial because my profile made it clear that I had nothing to sell,
didn't want a different job, wasn't looking for a new spouse, wasn't in the
market to buy anything, etc. What I did was describe my philosophy of life
and approach to networking. I made a few amazing connections.

One was Jan Bleckmann, who accepted my connection request without comment.
About three years later he wrote to thank me because he was very impressed
by my profile and when browsing my contacts he noticed Simone, who was also
in Frankfurt. They started corresponding, initially discussing my
philosophy but eventually they started dating and eventually decided to get
married. Without doing anything except asking each of them to accept my
connection request I seemed to have altered the course of their lives.

Jan reminds me of a few others I met through Xing who I need to reconnect
with: Janine, who is also from Frankfurt and who went out of her way to
meet me in in Hamburg one time when I was there on a trip, Juma, who
befriended me in 2009 who I interested in game; he went on to start his own
design studio and launched a top-selling game through Kickstarter called Cl=
ans
of Caledonia
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/680649956/clans-of-caledonia-a-game-a=
bout-whisky-trade-and-g/description>.
And, then there is Aleks, from Poland. She is a young woman who was looking
for a job and who turned out to be the daughter of an amateur radio
operator who I had been talking to via shortwave since my childhood in the
1960's.

So, for me, "networking" during covid hasn't been spammy but rather a
chance to recount fond memories and reconnect with old friends and
collaborators.

Back more than a decade ago -- when I became an "open networker" -- I put a
lot of effort into researching the topic, and even had a really nice
conversation with Robin Dunbar, famous for Dunbar's Number
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number> -- the 15 or so in your
"personal advisory", the 150 on the holiday list.

I told Dunbar that I thought of the people around me in terms of 4 circles
characterized by motivation to help.

*Like Family* -- those who might help me *even if they don't like me*. 15
seems to be a limit here.
*Friends* -- the people who might help me *because *they like me. 150 seems
to be a limit here..
*Community* -- people who might help me *even if they don't know me*. Why
would they help me? Because we have a commonality of interest and they know
what I stand for. There doesn't seem to be a limit here. Back in the early
days of Couchsurfing.org I felt like I was a member of such a community.
(Today? not so much.)
*Everyone Else* -- These are the people who couldn't care less about me.
They serve the vital role of reminding me I'm not all that important.


I explained to Dunbar that I'd discovered that Like Family and
Community were more important than Friends. The reason is that during times
of stress I can become unlikeable and so a relationship that is based on
likeability can evaporate just when I need help the most. These are the
"write when you get work" types. That's why I put my "networking" efforts
into building a personal "community" -- people with commonality of
interest. Then, when I need help I "broadcast" my needs. I don't make my
appeal personal, not because I want to be a spammer, but so that no
individual feels put upon to respond. Similarly, when I have free time, I
survey my connections to see who could use help so as to maintain a
positive balance in the Karma Bank.

Come to think of it, I did receive one "spammy" email from a woman who had
been a journalist and who wrote not to ask how I was but to announce that
she'd given up journalism in favor of editing. She wanted me to go through
all my LinkedIn contacts and recommend her for editing assignments.

I told her I wouldn't be doing that, but I would be interested in
co-authoring a piece on "networking during a pandemic."

She said she wouldn't be doing that unless someone paid her in advance to
do it, so that went nowhere.

Perhaps you'd care to collaborate on an article for the popular press on
networking during a pandemic. Rather than reconcile views perhaps we could
just record a conversation and turn it into a publishable piece.

Let me know if that interests you.

Brooke

P. S. I looked at your  Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing links. I don't
see an obvious way I can be of help

Regarding IndigoMetrics, I have a lot to say about creating a values-based
enterprise, but I'd like that to be in the form of a conversation (that
perhaps we could record and turn into another article).

Then I looked at your website and found some commonality of interest:

*Fiction: *I'm also interested in using fiction to explore serious topics.
I wrote *The Case of the Worthless Newspapers: Calling All Irregulars*
<https://www.amazon.com/Case-Worthless-Newspapers-Calling-Irregulars-ebook/=
dp/B019FS8BU8>as
a collaborative mystery story where Sherlock Holmes doesn't solve the
puzzles but rather gives clues and asks readers to collaborate to solve the
mysteries using annotation tools at hypothes.is. This is written under by
anagramatic pen name Len Bakerloo <http://LenBakerloo.com>.

My current work-in-progress is called *Faith, Foster and The Lifewizard Way=
*.
It is about a 12-year old girl and her sidekick who discover an ancient
document called The Lifewizard Way which consists of a series of questions
for young people to ask the adults around them to determine who is worth
paying attention to and who is best ignored. They build a website to share
it (LifewizardWay.com) and when the novel comes out you'll learn how Faith
and Foster use the tool to solve a mystery and straighten out the adults in
their lives. (When the time comes, I could use Beta readers if you are
interested or know someone who might be.)

*Hacking Work: *My primary interest is in Hacking Hiring. See this article
by me: https://qz.com/88168/how-to-hire-good-people-instead-of-nice-people/
and this about me:
https://www.wired.com/2015/01/the-way-we-hire-is-all-wrong/ Rather than
select candidates on traditional methods (resumes, cover letters,
networking, etc.) I cast a broad net, invite everyone who responds to
create a temporary community to help each other find work and I help them
too. I'll also give them space and permission to collaborate on projects of
their choice. That way I see their values and work habits in action. The QZ
article is about how I hired people when I ran a hedge fund, and the Wired
piece is by a journalist who attended a hiring event I did for a SF tech
company as proof of concept of a business based on it. In terms of
collaborators, I'd be happy to find someone who wants to commercialize
these ideas.

*Reputation Economics:* This resonates for me because my dad taught me that
"your reputation is your most valuable asset." I have a quibble, however,
with your tag line: "Why who you know is worth more than what you have." My
reputation is not "who I know" but rather "who knows me" and, more
importantly, what they know about me in terms of my character and what I
can do and did do.

we don't care then it doesn't matter.*

is that during times of stress I can become unlikeable and so a relationshi=
p that is based on likeability can evaporate just when I need help the=C2=
=A0most. These are the &quot;write when you get work&quot; types. That&#39;=
s why I put my &quot;networking&quot; efforts into building a personal &quo=
t;community&quot; -- people with commonality of interest. Then, when I need=
 help I &quot;broadcast&quot; my needs. I don&#39;t make my appeal personal=
, not because I want to be a spammer,=C2=A0but so that no individual feels =
put upon to respond. Similarly, when I have free time, I survey my connecti=
ons to see who could use help so as to maintain a positive balance in the K=
arma Bank.</div><div><br></div><div>Come to think of it, I did receive one =
&quot;spammy&quot; email from a woman who had been a journalist and who wro=
te not to ask how I was but to announce that she&#39;d given up journalism =
in favor of editing. She wanted me to go through all my LinkedIn contacts a=
nd recommend her for editing assignments.</div><div><br></div><div>I told h=
er I wouldn&#39;t be doing that, but I would be interested in co-authoring =
a piece on &quot;networking during a pandemic.&quot;</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>She said she wouldn&#39;t be doing that unless someone paid her in advan=
ce to do it, so that went nowhere.</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps you&#39=
;d care to collaborate on an article for the popular press on networking du=
ring a pandemic. Rather than reconcile views perhaps we could just record a=
 conversation and turn it into a publishable piece.</div></div><div><br></d=

div><br></div><div>Regarding IndigoMetrics, I have a lot to say about=C2=A0=
creating a values-based enterprise, but I&#39;d like that to be in the form=
 of a conversation (that perhaps we could record and turn into another arti=
cle).</div><div><br></div><div>Then I looked at your website and found some=
 commonality of interest:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Fiction: </b>I&#39;m =
also interested in using fiction to explore serious topics. I wrote=C2=A0<a=
 href=3D"https://www.amazon.com/Case-Worthless-Newspapers-Calling-Irregular=
s-ebook/dp/B019FS8BU8"><i>The Case of the Worthless Newspapers: Calling All=
 Irregulars</i> </a>as a collaborative mystery story where Sherlock Holmes =
doesn&#39;t solve the puzzles but rather gives clues and asks readers to co=
llaborate to solve the mysteries using annotation tools at <a href=3D"http:=
//hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a>. This is written under by anagramatic pen na=
me <a href=3D"http://LenBakerloo.com">Len Bakerloo</a>.</div><div><br></div=
><div>My current work-in-progress is called <i>Faith, Foster and The Lifewi=
zard Way</i>. It is about a 12-year old girl and her sidekick who discover =
an ancient document called The Lifewizard Way which consists of a series of=
 questions for young people to ask the adults around them to determine who =
is worth paying attention to and who is best ignored. They build a website =
to share it (<a href=3D"http://LifewizardWay.com">LifewizardWay.com</a>) an=
d when the novel comes out you&#39;ll learn how Faith and Foster use the to=
ol to solve a mystery and straighten out the adults in their lives. (When t=
he time comes, I could use Beta readers if you are interested or know someo=
ne who might be.)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Hacking Work: </b>My primary =
interest is in Hacking Hiring. See this article by me:=C2=A0<a href=3D"http=
s://qz.com/88168/how-to-hire-good-people-instead-of-nice-people/">https://q=
z.com/88168/how-to-hire-good-people-instead-of-nice-people/</a> and this ab=

=C2=A0Rather than select candidates on traditional methods (resumes, cover =
letters, networking, etc.) I cast a broad net, invite everyone who responds=
 to create a temporary community to help each other find work and I help th=
em too. I&#39;ll also give them space and permission to collaborate on proj=
ects of their choice. That way I see their values and work habits in action=
. The QZ article is about how I hired=C2=A0people when I ran a hedge fund, =
and the Wired piece is by a journalist who attended a hiring event=C2=A0I d=
id for a SF tech company as proof of concept of a business based on it. In =
terms of collaborators, I&#39;d be happy to find someone who wants to comme=
rcialize these ideas.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div><b>Reputation Economic=
s:</b> This resonates for me because my dad taught me that &quot;your reput=
ation is your most valuable asset.&quot; I have a quibble, however, with yo=
ur tag line: &quot;Why who you know is worth more than what you have.&quot;=
 My reputation is not &quot;who I know&quot; but rather &quot;who knows me&=
quot; and, more importantly, what they know about me in terms of my charact=
er and what I can do and did do.=C2=A0</div><div></div><div><div dir=3D"ltr=
