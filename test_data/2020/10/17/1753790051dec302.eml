Josh,

Unfortunately the TTFB is not something that can be optimized. All speed increases on the Grid would need to come from the site itself, as the Grid is a shared hosting environment that does not have root privileges available to the customer for making server configuration changes.

You may want to consider migrating to a dedicated hosting environment, such as the DV Server. This allows for root privileges and the ability to make server configuration changes. Each of our servers come with a 30 day money back guarantee, so if you try it out and it's not meeting your needs, you can close it within 30 days and receive a full refund.
