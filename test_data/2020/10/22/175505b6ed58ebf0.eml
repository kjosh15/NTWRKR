Interesting.

In 1995 I was hired to build a business unit inside a firm with about 350
people.

When I got there I asked my boss, "Do you have a mission statement?"

He said, "I don't know. I'll look around."

I said, "If you don't know what it is and I don't know then it doesn't
matter, so I'm writing my own."

That turned out to be very good news because what I wrote was vastly better
than anything they could have come up with.

So, what is the mission and values statement you'd write right now, today?

 our business was predicated on and included the criterion by which we coul=

<div>The CIO turned beet red. He said, &quot;What&#39;s this shit? I want t=

 first principles then the only thing you will ever be is a competitor, and=
 there is no way I&#39;m sharing any of that with you. Your time is valuabl=
e, but so is mine. You said you&#39;d give me 30 minutes and I&#39;m taking=
 it. Now, shut up and pay attention.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>I walke=
d him through the document. About 15 minutes in his demeanor softened and a=
s I approached the end he began laughing.</div><div><br></div><div>He said,=
 &quot;I&#39;ve been doing this for 22 years and in no instance did a busin=
ess plan survive the first year. And, in every instance where a business fe=
ll apart it was because they and we didn&#39;t see eye-to-eye on one of the=
 things you&#39;ve addressed. I like what you&#39;ve done and I want to inv=

v><div>He said, &quot;I don&#39;t care. Any business you can run on these t=
erms I want to be a part of.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>I told him that=
 the biggest risk to our business was not to the market or to our ideas but=
 to the <i>character </i>of our investors. For that reason, the next step w=
as that I needed to interview him, his staff and his major investors so tha=
t I might judge <i>their </i>character and determine what principles <i>the=
y </i>live by.</div><div><br></div><div>He agreed to that and I spent a hal=
f day with them. I even composed a written test and collected impromptu ess=
ays from them. Even if they had not heretofore lived according to the words=
 they gave me I made it clear I would hold them to their rhetoric hencefort=
h.</div><div><br></div><div>They did pretty well, so I gave them a final te=
st. I had a competing offer from another firm that was not structured as an=
 equity stake but an investment management and IP deal where I retained 100=
% ownership.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Because if the investor bought=
=C2=A0into my company then we&#39;d be partners working for the benefit of =
both of us, I told them to evaluate both the competing deal and their own a=
nd give me a recommendation and I&#39;d do what they suggest. But, they had=
 to understand that if they recommended I go with them and later I found ou=
t they did it because it was in their best interest but not mine then they =
would have one hell of a pissed-off partner.</div><div><br></div><div>They =
did as I asked and spent a day with the competition getting the details of =
their deal and auditing their character.</div><div><br></div><div>Then they=
 gave me a report recommending I go with the competition and not them.</div=
><div><br></div><div>This is the power of well-articulated and well-lived m=
ission and values. Often when=C2=A0 an investor comes along people start se=
eing an exit strategy and dollar signs and start jumping through absurd hoo=
ps that can often destroy their focus and even their business.</div><div><b=
r></div><div>I didn&#39;t have to do that. I had a long-standing document t=
hat guided our behavior and that gave me the courage to dictate terms and i=
nteract with others as I did.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>After auditing=
 the investor&#39;s character I didn&#39;t have to do anything. They are th=
e ones, for example, who created a business plan for a business as they cou=
ld imagine it after we were partners and they submitted it to me for my app=
roval. And they are the ones who compared that to the competition and they =
determined their offer was inferior.</div><div><br></div><div>We really did=
n&#39;t have to do anything except be who we are and hold them to who they =
said they were.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>That is what character is; i=
t is who we are. The first step is to say who that is so you can know who t=
o be when things get confusing. There were plenty of well-run endeavors bef=
ore the mobile device, the personal computer and even before the discovery =
of electricity.</div><div><br></div><div>There is power in the written word=
, and IMHO the word and the will are both necessary and sufficient. That do=

 improved by an app.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>If you&#39;d like to di=

iv>Brooke</div><div><br></div><div>P. S. That investor wanted to buy into u=
s in 2005. Every deal they did with others fell apart by 2009 whereas we we=
nt strong through the entire financial collapse and didn&#39;t shut down un=
til 2014 only a few basis points off an all-time high. We shut down because=
 the conditions on which our business was predicated had faded and there wa=
s no longer a point. Shutting down isn&#39;t what most people do at the top=
 of the business cycle S-curve. Instead they either drive themselves off a =
cliff or try to sell to a greater fool. We could have done that but it woul=
