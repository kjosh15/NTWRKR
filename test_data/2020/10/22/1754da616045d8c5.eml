Lol, Josh you are too generous ... it's Texas! the view is, the virus will
magically disappear post election, as it is a media play in an election
year, to smear their beloved leader. Luckily it's not many people I
interact with, but still, hair raising when it does=F0=9F=98=B3

So is it embarrassing to admit that my life was kinda the same pre
pandemic...=F0=9F=98=AC Yes, it does make me wonder if I've accidentally re=
tired from
professional life for good, but it is what it is, especially for right
now...before the pandemic I'd go in once a week to spend a few hours
helping out on research projects, one of which was a virtual reality
wellness intervention to prevent burnout in nurses.  But, everything ground
to a halt as the hospital didn't want volunteers going in or any non
essential research to take place (non- Covid). But yeah, apart from that I
was mostly home working on my Board prep, and now l just work on being a
substitute teacher, games mistress and rarely on the virtual study
manuscript. So while I've been thankful I don't have to be at the hospital
having horrible shifts in the NHS, coz both kids were solidly home for
6months, I'm also no closer to a professional life here=F0=9F=A4=B7=F0=9F=
=8F=BB=E2=80=8D=E2=99=80=EF=B8=8F

What about you? Have you been able to work the same as before ?
Better/worse?

Btw, what does parking your number on google voice mean? I misspoke, you
won't lose your msgs, they all download to your new number once you install
it... still trying to convert everyone to WhatsApp, but Americans or maybe
Texans just don't seem to like using it much =F0=9F=98=82
