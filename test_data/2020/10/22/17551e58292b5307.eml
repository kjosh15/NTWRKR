Progress!

It looks to me like of the six domains on our service, only three need
professional help to migrate - fithit.com, krav-maga.nyc, and
kravmaga.fithit.com (which they *might* include as a subdomain of fithit.com).
The other three domains are simple placeholders or redirects, so (Steven?)
could easily set those up again. If we've got Matan's official sign-off for
the costs outlined below, I'll give MediaTemple the green light.

Adrian,

Thanks for reaching out to (mt) MediaTemple!

I've applied the credit from the Managed WordPress hosting over to the new
DV w/SSD and started at the rate we discussed previously at $440 for the
year. A remaining charge of $200 is now on the account and you can just
submit payment to get it provisioned right away.

Did you also want to add on migration services provided by our Advance
Support team? That would be $100 per site so just reply back letting us
know the number of sites you want to have Advance Support migrate for you
and I can get that added as well.

Just reply back to this Support Request in your (mt) MediaTemple Account
Center and I can update the charges accordingly.

Best regards,

Edward X.
