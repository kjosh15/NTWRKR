Josh! Sorry for the delay =E2=80=93 crazy couple of weeks. How about a =
Zoom chat on Wednesday 28th? I=E2=80=99m UK based so my afternoon would =
be better (assuming you=E2=80=99re in the States!)

It would be great to talk. Like you I tried a continuous blood glucose =
monitor in 2018 (I=E2=80=99m not diabetic, but a friend is a doctor and =
an ex-pro Ironman triathlete, so she slapped one on my shoulder!) and =
was fascinated by the data and insight=E2=80=A6

V best,
Ben=20
