Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple support! We're very sorry to hear of the latency issues you have been experiencing, and would be happy to assist.

As a courtesy, we ran your domain through GTmetrix.com. You can view the full report below, which contains helpful information that may be of some use to you.

https://gtmetrix.com/reports/josh.is/y3o3tXE3

One thing we noticed is that the initial redirect is taking longer than it should. Your site appears to be using a caching plugin that is creating the rewrite rules for HTTPS. It's possible that you may need to move the rewrite rules to redirect traffic to HTTPS further up your .htaccess file so that they are read and executed faster.

For comparison, the report below shows the site loads in under 3s when you visit HTTPS directly:

https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.josh.is/1SHmU0OA

If needed, example rewrite rules to redirect to HTTPS can be found in the article below. You may need to reach out to the plugin's developer if they are not compatible with your current rewrite rules:

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204643270/using-.htaccess-rewrite-rules#5

Hope this helps!

(mt) Media Temple is not responsible for the coding or development of your website and this is not something which is covered under the (mt) Media Temple Statement of Support. Please see our Statement of Support, linked below, for more information:
