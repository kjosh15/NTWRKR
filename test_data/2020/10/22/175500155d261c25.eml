Such a bizarre, strange country... Being outside it for longer only
exacerbates the impression!

What do you mean by Board prep? Law, or seats?

Work on my end has been... mixed. My startup has been doing extremely well,
and we're aiming to do a raise this fall. OTOH, I had 19 speeches booked
and by June every single one was cancelled. I'm still on retainer to my
pool of senior executives, so still get random calls about world-spanning
tech from the titans of industry, but my regular project/consulting work
has vanished (as all my big multinational clients are retrenching to "only
hire McKinzie.") It's a bizarre mish-mash of abject disappearance of work
and thrilling opportunity, which would be easier to swallow if being paid
came with the latter as the former tailed off. But hey, it's a pandemic,
right? As you noted, it could be worse.

By "parking" I mean I moved my cell # to a good voice service, which then
forward to the Google Voice client on my phone. I.e., all my us clients
call the same number and there's no visible difference.

And thanks for the Whatsapp tip - maybe I'll make the move after all!
