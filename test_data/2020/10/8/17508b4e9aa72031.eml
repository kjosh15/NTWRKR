Alright. That servo shouldn't be a problem but I want to try one thing.

So, when you turn your Crowbox on, you get flashing lights and the servo
moves in odd ways. I want to eliminate the servo for a moment and see what
happens. By now you've probably plugged back in the wires that I asked you
to remove for our last test. If you haven't plugged them back in, please do
so now.

What I want you to try is:

-Turn off the Crowbox power
-Remove the RED servo wire from the breadboard (this will cut power to the
servo)
-Power up the Crowbox

Now, we obviously won't get to see any activity from the servo because it
won't receive power, but I want you to focus instead on the LED. Tell me if
the LED continues to blink as we've been seeing.

Thanks!

-Steve

eliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones. Not only do=
 you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can stop worryi=

wer supply issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rul=
e that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds =
which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo =
behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software sh=
ouldn&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the =

When the servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current=
. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power su=
pply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board a=
nd sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the =
first thing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it.=
 This could explain why your lid behaves the way it does.<u></u><u></u></p>=

eft:33.6pt">1) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino s=
till connected to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2=
A power supply. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the U=
SB connection and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so=
 brownouts can happen this way.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"Mso=
Normal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p =
class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">2) Make sure the power sup=
ply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires abou=
t 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which=
 can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s =
any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we rec=
ommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of ava=

, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power suppli=
es with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related problems I kn=
ow of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and the other p=
erson had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and didn&#39;t sup=
