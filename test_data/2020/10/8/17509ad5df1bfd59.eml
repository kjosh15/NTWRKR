Making sure this didn't fall through the cracks - since the pandemic all =
the time we've saved on commuting seems to have been immediately absorbed =

All best,
Josh

I figured I'd try something different. We've=
 worked together before, and more importantly you're someone I *enjoyed* =
working with, and would work with again. Below is a shortlist of my current=
 projects; reply with an update on your current projects, or schedule a =
time(https://josh.is/scheduling) and let's chat!=20
Looking forward to reconnecting,

Current Projects:
