Sounds good. I was going to follow up with the below - just wanted to
double check there was no widespread reveal yet!

- J

###

Michael, Kristin,

Wanted to follow up on the data Chris sent; it's super interesting stuff!
One challenge is that of the absent participants two are relatively senior.
Given that values are usually messaged strongly by leadership it would be
really good to get them involved at this early stage to make sure our
models are evolving as fast as possible.

One idea Michael had suggested a couple weeks ago was to schedule a town
hall with everyone involved in the beta rollout to answer questions and
discuss the platform. This is suggested best practice anyway, as it
precludes surprises during the data reveal and could also help prompt the
participation we're after. Could we set this up?

All best,
Josh
