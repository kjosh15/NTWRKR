NHNZ.TV, the production company I did Smart China and Game Vision with, has
a long history of animal shows and is getting very deeply in bed with
Netflix. Is Kingdom fully gone, or is it something we could shop to them?

In full disclosure, the contact came because of a science show they wanted
to attach me to as a possibility, but if we can get Kingdom back I'm
willing to play!

Hope you and yours are doing well,
Josh
