Chris,

Just talked to my friends at clay.run who did a spectacular raise last year
in the US. They both said $1mm on a $10mm val wouldn't make any sense to a
US investor just b/c those aren't numbers anyone sees. They pointed out
that minimum you'd want $3mm on a $15mm valuation, mostly because you're
going to lose 15-20% of your company to take it.

They were also very bullish about the strategic investment side. Their
experience was that if you're in a hot area and you're socialized correctly
(i.e., appear smart and have a good story) then you can demand very high
rates, but that while there IS a lot of money around it's being very
strategically applied.

The last big point they made was that you have to not want it to raise it -
i.e., if you seem to need it nobody is going to give you jack. So it sounds
like our strategy of getting a soft commitment in the UK and then looking
for strategic in the US is the right approach.

They're happy to provide introductions, once we're ready. A shortlist of
potential targets they came up with was:

rippling.com
zenefits
workday
gusto
justworks
adp

Let me know if this changes anything for you.
