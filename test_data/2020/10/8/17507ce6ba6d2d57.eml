Thanks, Val, very very much appreciated! I made a short rewrite based on
your notes (below) - let me know if anyone at Wharton is interested in a
quick conversation to see if there is overlap!

All best,
Josh


"IndigoMetrics is an expert system SaaS platform that uses short (3 minute)
peer-to-peer surveys on core organizational values to a) measure alignment
and engagement, and b) change and improve corporate culture via human
behavior - autonomously and at scale. As one of the first HR utilities to
provide a statistical model for behavior we've been able to collect an
impressive data set of bias-corrected culture changes over time.

We're looking to conduct an academic study of the data to determine how,
where, and at what rate this change can be best effected. As computer
modeling and data collection expand, the potential for bad models and
unexpected effects is growing exponentially. We believe that the
IndigoMetrics platform provides an ideal proving ground for identifying and
preventing mistaken impacts, and improving positive culture evolutions."
