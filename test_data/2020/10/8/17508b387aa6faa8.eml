Hi Josh,

The new pitch sounds a lot more relevant to me based on my knowledge of the c=
oursework and research interests.=20

I reached out to Cade Massey, he is one of the Profs in charge of Wharton Pe=
ople Analytics. He promised to discuss with the broader org and get back re t=
heir research team=E2=80=99s current interest in pursuing the conversation f=
urther.

Best,
Val
