Gustavo,

Apologies for the delay; been juggling cat shipments - but as of now
they're safely in their new home in Seattle! We hope you and Etukai are
continuing to settle in.

I wanted to follow up on the items we discussed in our last call. Let me
know if I'm getting too tactical here, but otherwise:

- Kids toys

Please do take a picture of the kids stuff Etukai was interested in. If our
boys are ok with it he can continue playing with them and you can pack up
and send everything else. Sound good?

- Harvard books

Can you pack these up and send these separately to my sister by December?

- General packing

You sensibly pointed out that we don't need to pay for storage until
December. That said, I'd rather have our "stuff to be stored" list packed
up earlier rather than later as we're hoping to be moving down the road
here soon and may want to ship it over for us there. When do you think you
could get our "stuff to be stored" list packed up? That way you could leave
packing everything else into storage in Dec.

- Oils and supplements

Feel free to use anything that's open, and if you want anything that isn't
just send us a snapshot and we'll figure out if it's expensive enough to be
worth asking you to cover at some discounted rate. Really appreciate your
kindness here!

- Kids art supplies

Ditto in this case. Please use anything that isn't sealed / reusable if
shipped; just take a picture of the latter and we'll figure it out. Happy
to have you guys be well provisioned, and if you'd be using it anyway let's
save shipping stuff across the planet if we can!

- The kids allowance jars

Thanks for telling us the amount in each; are you going to just include it
in the rent transfer?

- Box of stuff to ship to us

I'll set up a shipping label for you, hopefully before end of week!

All best,
Josh
