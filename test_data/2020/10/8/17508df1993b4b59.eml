To whom it may concern,

I've recently moved to Iceland and am keen to work with companies here,
either as an advisor or consultant in new product development or technology
strategy. Most of my work has been in either the US (NYC/S.F.) or the EU
(London/Switzerland primarily), but I've lectured at Bifrost and am
reasonably familiar with the startup scene here (mostly through Iceland
Venture Studio).

Any advice you may have on connecting with companies that are looking for
more senior-level assistance, either internationally or strategically,
would be much appreciated. I bring access to a significant business network
after a decade's consulting work to senior executives of much of the
Fortune 500 as well as deep experience at companies like IDEO, Corning, and
others in developing new and innovative technology initiatives and
corporate strategy.

Iceland is a small but hugely potent market, and I'm excited to build
connections here. My CV, Board CV, and presskit are attached, and more
information is available at my website (www.josh.is) and on linkedin (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaklein/). Any advice or connections are
appreciated!

Kind regards,
Joshua Klein
