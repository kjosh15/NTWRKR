Matan,

We have completed your migration!

You can test it out by editing your hosts file. Once you are ready to make
the switch live, you will just need to remove the below entry from your
hosts file.

 Below is/are the line(s) you need to add:

 64.13.224.50 kravmaga.fithit.com www.kravmaga.fithit.com

 Our Community article at
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643190 will show you how
to preview your domain before DNS is pointed to your (mt) service.

 Once you are ready to make the switch live, you will just need to remove
the above preview line(s) and point DNS for the domain to your (dv)
Dedicated-Virtual Server IP, 64.13.224.50. The easiest method to point DNS
to (mt) Media Temple is to change your name servers to ns1.mediatemple.net
and ns2.mediatemple.net via your registrar.

 PLEASE NOTE: Failure to update DNS may result in viewers viewing the old
website with old content. If your DNS has not been updated and you continue
to make changes to your website, these changes will not carry over to your
new service.

 Please contact us right away if you notice any issues with this migration.
Please keep in mind that (mt) Media Temple will be unable to troubleshoot
or provide assistance with issues that arise after 14 days from the
migration completion date.

 If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact
us by replying to this support request, or by calling us at 877-578-4000.
We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for continuing to use (mt) Media
Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,
