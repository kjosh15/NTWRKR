Smari,

Thanks for the call earlier; as usual I left much enlightened. I'll check
out Northstack and connect w/ Jokull via Signal (thanks for the intro!); in
the meantime next week is looking a little packed for me to be useful.
Given that you've got a year-long timeline anyway, can we push to the week
after to meet and discuss board seats in Iceland (and beyond)? Maybe Nov 10
and 10am GMT?
