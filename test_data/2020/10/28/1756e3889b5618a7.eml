No scotch, but I'll see what I can do about the fireplace.

Let me know if you have time in a couple weeks for a follow up. I'll
endeavor to briefly summarize my current business ventures in case you find
them interesting, as well as to give a little color on my background and
varied (mis)adventures. Hopefully you can return the favor and we'll take
it from there.

Sincerely,
Josh

P.S. Just a note to myself here, reminding me to also ask you about my
advisory board.
