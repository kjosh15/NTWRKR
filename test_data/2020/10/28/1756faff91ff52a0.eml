hey Josh

not sure how we met or worked together... But Im intrigued by the AI
project. I need to look for someone who can work on a bot of sorts. This
would be related to assisting people with small business development
fundamentals. Is that within your wheelhouse? or maybe you can refer me to
somebody who has this made already?

best
ESN
