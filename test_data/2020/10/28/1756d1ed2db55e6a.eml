Uggh home-learning this week - it always feels like pulling teeth =F0=9F=98=
=B5

It is so weird to think NY is not back to pre-pandemic life and that you've
been lucky to escape, and probably are not missing out on any of the things
you miss about it.

Did you have family close by to help out in NY? What about now in Iceland?

Not sure I have connections I recommend, as don't feel particularly well
connected in the US yet, but how about smaller companies like Data Bricks
or Cloudera?

Betterment is another one - well established Fintech and a health one is
Parsley health - the first run by Sean's college cohort  of friends and
the second by the wife of a friend of a friend (in that same cohort)

The company we were partnering with for research was Reality Based Wellnes.
They are based in Austin but I think just starting out.

Honestly don't know if any of these are good fits for you - did you ever
consider the enemy Mckinsey?
