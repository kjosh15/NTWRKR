Fully agreed. Have been thinking about this problem but from the other
side; there are plenty of consultancies that have these questions (and what
they think are answers to them) but not a platform for measuring their
efficacy. Perhaps it's time to work with a consultancy again to validate
that the platform works agnostically for this sort of thing?
