 to provide solutions for people who built Tailfeather Crowboxes and are ha=

 into that. We want folks who already built Tailfeather boxes to be able to=
 properly use them. Especially if we&#39;re going to revise the design- we =
don&#39;t want that to feel like abandonment for existing users.</div><div>=

nsolidated to a single color. The design now fits onto one color sheet, a t=
ransparent sheet, and a styrene sheet. This minimizes the uploads to 3, as =
the design fits within a single 790mm x 384mm sheet, but does limit the mat=
erial choices a bit. Two colors can be achieved by ordering two colors and =
building two boxes. I did this because I&#39;d like to run experiments on c=
olor performance, so a single sheet was important, as was the ability to sw=
ap out the basket / and housing subassemblies =E2=80=94 transparency might =
allow some birds to feel more comfortable if they can see the inner working=
s?</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">2. Separated the design=
 into two main subassemblies that fit together in a &quot;slide into place&=
quot; locking fashion. This removes the side access panel and allows the ma=
jority of the front to be removed for servicing without any fasteners (I=E2=
=80=99m going to beta test this obviously =E2=80=94 but hypothetically it&#=
39;ll work, haha.) This necessitated shifting the limit switches to the sid=
e panels, and I think improves some other aspects that I=E2=80=99ll be veri=
fying.</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></div><div dir=3D"ltr">3. Added an enclosu=
re for the primary electronics so that portion can be =E2=80=9Cweatherproof=
ed=E2=80=9D independently of the main housing as this was one of my main wo=
rries for my climate. If not needed, this can be used as the standard elect=
ronics sled without building it out =E2=80=94 but I have this mounted verti=
cally now which might help with moisture retention around the Arduino.</div=

creating a repo or two on github or gitlab? One for the code, and one for t=

a lot of these things may necessitate re-recording some of the really amazi=

nage on base panel (drainage holes in all four corners, and small grid of d=
rainage hopes near the coin sensor assembly / coin entrance)</li><li>Move p=
ower supply hole to the bottom</li><li>Make the front/basket subassembly re=
placeable using 3m nuts/bolts/washers=C2=A0(this would allow for minor vers=
ions -- v2.0 -&gt; v2.1 could be only adjustments to the the basket subasse=
mbly, or changes to improve the base subassembly independently, or testing =
different material / color options)</li><li>Switch to metric for everything=
 (I see inches in some places, and even as an American I don&#39;t want to =
anymore, haha)</li><li>Migrate to using a single limit switch in the back o=
f the machine by the perch hook (is there a redundancy reason for the two l=
imit switches that I&#39;m missing maybe?)</li><li>Remove the perch hook an=
d include it into the shape of the perch platform</li><li>Find and utilize =
a standard adapter measurement for the base reinforcing ring / bolt holes i=
n base panel (for this I mean something like=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.gl=
