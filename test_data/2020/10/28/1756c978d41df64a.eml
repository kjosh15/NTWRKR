Whole bunch of thoughts!

At a very high level, handing over source to physical parts and letting
someone else work on an 'updated' version represents a transition of the
project to public domain. That one is a call you have to make, it's your
concept and your project. I assume you've already considered this.

Next up, I feel like the Crowbox is due for an evolution. Jeremy proposes a
bunch of solutions for the "Tailfeather" design, some of them are for known
problems and others have more mysterious origins. I'm not saying I'm
suspicious, I'm just saying I don't fully understand his approach to making
decisions on design changes. He's added drainage holes to the corners of
the base plate and designed some kind of water shield for the Arduino, but
the correct action is for us to solve the problem where water can get
inside in the first place. A known and embarrassing flaw. But if we were
going to reissue geometry and change the physical plans in some way, I'd
want to solve the root problem, not add drainage holes. For instance.

Some other things I'd like to be sure are improved in a new version:

Overall number of unique parts: I'm talking about things like the metal
clips I recommend to secure the perch so that Crows can't pull it off
trying to find a way down into the snack box. Two metal clips are simple,
and probably cost less than 5 cents each, but a person has to buy 100 of
them on Amazon just to get the two they need. Or, they have to go to a
hardware store and buy two from a loose fasteners section.

Kit Price: We can attack part of this problem by cutting the number of
unique parts. Another way is to change the majority material. From acrylic
to wood, for instance. In addition to cutting costs, this, done properly,
would also allow people to build more of the box with familiar tools
(screws, say) instead of dealing with so much acrylic cement which makes
irreversible changes to the acrylic parts (in the event of a mistaken
assembly, for instance).

Complexity: Should go down automatically if we succeed at the previous two
items.

Availability: Ponoko just plugged us, right? In fact, can you bring me up
to speed with what's going on there? They don't do the SHOWROOM anymore?
Ponoko was a good choice because we had SO many acrylic parts in three
colors -AND- styrene parts. It sucks that a third party can shut down parts
availability like this. If we arranged it so that most of the box was wood
(in standard Home Depot-available dimensions) we could get the interior
acrylic machine parts down to one 12x12 transparent acrylic sheet that
could be cut anywhere- in local stores, makerspaces, or through whichever
internet laser-cutting service the user would choose. They'd just upload a
single DXF (provided by the Crowbox project) and receive their plastic
parts.

I got off topic a bit. In fact, I have too many thoughts trying to come out
at the same moment so maybe I need to think more. I think this has a lot to
do with us not really having an opportunity to have a good post-mortem
discussion about the project. There were some last-minute problems with the
design that I had to solve so that we could launch and I could get on to
some other real-life issues that were really pressuring me at the time, so
I had to patch those up as much as I could. The not-so-great way the side
door attaches is one, the decision to fuse the coin magazine to the machine
lid was another. There are several, and some we got away with just fine and
some I think we paid a cost for.

We should pick a time that works in both time zones and maybe have a video
chat? Catch up, boil some of these issues down?

As for Jeremy, an enthusiastic and motivated collaborator could be helpful
to the project. Especially if he's capable. But I think that high-level
design decisions need to be made by us, picking a direction for the project=
.

I also think that we need to provide solutions for people who built
Tailfeather Crowboxes and are having problems with leakage. In fact, as far
as I know, this is the only real problem that many users are facing. So I'm
still putting some thought into that. We want folks who already built
Tailfeather boxes to be able to properly use them. Especially if we're
going to revise the design- we don't want that to feel like abandonment for
existing users.

<div dir=3D"ltr">Whole bunch of thoughts!<div><br></div><div>At a very high=
 level, handing over source to physical parts and letting someone else work=
 on an &#39;updated&#39; version represents a transition of the project to =
public domain. That one is a call you have to make, it&#39;s your concept a=
nd your project. I assume you&#39;ve already considered this.=C2=A0</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>Next up, I feel like the Crowbox is due for an evolution.=
 Jeremy proposes a bunch of solutions for the=C2=A0&quot;Tailfeather&quot; =
design, some of them are for known problems and others have more mysterious=
 origins. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m suspicious, I&#39;m just saying I don&=
#39;t fully understand his approach to making decisions on design changes. =
He&#39;s added drainage holes to the corners of the base plate and designed=
=C2=A0some kind of water shield for the Arduino, but the correct action is =
for us to solve the problem where water can get inside in the first place. =
A known and embarrassing flaw. But if we were going to reissue geometry and=
 change the physical plans in some way, I&#39;d want to solve the root prob=
lem, not add drainage holes. For instance.</div><div><br></div><div>Some ot=
her things I&#39;d like to be sure are improved in a new version:</div><div=
><br></div><div>Overall number of unique parts: I&#39;m talking about thing=
s like the metal clips I recommend to secure the perch so that Crows can&#3=
9;t pull it off trying to find a way down into the snack box. Two metal cli=
ps are simple, and probably cost less than 5 cents each, but a person has t=
o buy 100 of them on Amazon just to get the two they need. Or, they have to=
 go to a hardware store and buy two from a loose fasteners section.=C2=A0</=
div><div><br></div><div>Kit Price: We can attack part of this problem by cu=
tting the number of unique parts. Another way is to change the majority mat=
erial. From acrylic to wood, for instance. In addition to cutting costs, th=
is, done properly, would also allow people to build more of the box with fa=
miliar tools (screws, say) instead of dealing with so much acrylic cement w=
hich makes irreversible changes to the acrylic parts (in the event of a mis=
taken assembly, for instance).=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Complexity: S=
hould go down automatically if we succeed at the previous two items.</div><=
div><br></div><div>Availability: Ponoko just plugged us, right? In fact, ca=
n you bring me up to speed with what&#39;s going on there? They don&#39;t d=
o the SHOWROOM anymore? Ponoko was a good choice because we had SO many acr=
ylic parts in three colors -AND- styrene parts. It sucks that a third party=
 can shut down parts availability like this. If we arranged it so that most=
 of the box was wood (in standard Home Depot-available dimensions) we could=
 get the interior acrylic machine parts down to one 12x12 transparent acryl=
ic sheet that could be cut anywhere- in local stores, makerspaces, or throu=
gh whichever internet laser-cutting service the user would choose. They&#39=
;d just upload a single DXF (provided by the Crowbox project) and receive t=
heir plastic parts.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I got off topic a bit. I=
n fact, I have too many thoughts trying to come out at the same moment so m=
aybe I need to think=C2=A0more. I think this has a lot to do with us not re=
ally having an opportunity to have a good post-mortem discussion about the =
project. There were some last-minute problems with the design that I had to=
 solve so that we could launch and I could get on to some other real-life i=
ssues that were really pressuring me at the time, so I had to patch those u=
p as much as I could. The not-so-great way the side door attaches is one, t=
he decision to fuse the coin magazine to the machine lid was another. There=
 are several, and some we got away with just fine and some I think we paid =
a cost for.</div><div><br></div><div>We should pick a time that works in bo=
th time zones and maybe have a video chat? Catch up, boil some of these iss=
ues down?=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As for Jeremy, an enthusiastic and=
 motivated collaborator could be helpful to the project. Especially if he&#=
39;s capable. But I think that high-level design decisions need to be made =
by us, picking a direction for the project.</div><div><br></div><div>I also=
 think that we need to provide solutions for people who built Tailfeather C=
rowboxes and are having problems with leakage. In fact, as far as I know, t=
his is the only real problem that many users are facing. So I&#39;m still p=
utting some thought into that. We want folks who already built Tailfeather =
boxes to be able to properly use them. Especially if we&#39;re going to rev=
ise the design- we don&#39;t want that to feel like abandonment for existin=
g users.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div><div><br></div=

1. Reduced cost - to do this I=E2=80=99ve consolidated to a single color. T=
he design now fits onto one color sheet, a transparent sheet, and a styrene=
 sheet. This minimizes the uploads to 3, as the design fits within a single=
 790mm x 384mm sheet, but does limit the material choices a bit. Two colors=
 can be achieved by ordering two colors and building two boxes. I did this =
because I&#39;d like to run experiments on color performance, so a single s=
heet was important, as was the ability to swap out the basket / and housing=
 subassemblies =E2=80=94 transparency might allow some birds to feel more c=
omfortable if they can see the inner workings?</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><br></=
div><div dir=3D"ltr">2. Separated the design into two main subassemblies th=
at fit together in a &quot;slide into place&quot; locking fashion. This rem=
oves the side access panel and allows the majority of the front to be remov=
ed for servicing without any fasteners (I=E2=80=99m going to beta test this=
 obviously =E2=80=94 but hypothetically it&#39;ll work, haha.) This necessi=

some other aspects that I=E2=80=99ll be verifying.</div><div dir=3D"ltr"><b=

so that portion can be =E2=80=9Cweatherproofed=E2=80=9D independently of th=

@Josh, what are your thoughts on creating a repo or two on github or gitlab=

? I&#39;d consider forking the shape files and making some proposed modific=
ations to them -- I&#39;ve got a lot of ideas floating around -- not really=
 &quot;waterproofing it&quot;, but minimizing water damage potential and ma=
king it more weather resistant (I&#39;m in Colorado so get to do real world=
 testing, haha).</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some of the ideas I&#39;=
ve formed so far and will bring as proposals if we had things up on github =
or gitlab. I know full well that a lot of these things may necessitate re-r=
ecording some of the really amazing videos at some time in the future, but =
I&#39;ve got a couple solutions about how some division in the housing will=
 make it easier to version things, including generating new videos in the f=
uture.</div><div><ol><li>Add drainage on base panel (drainage holes in all =
four corners, and small grid of drainage hopes near the coin sensor assembl=
y / coin entrance)</li><li>Move power supply hole to the bottom</li><li>Mak=
e the front/basket subassembly replaceable using 3m nuts/bolts/washers=C2=
=A0(this would allow for minor versions -- v2.0 -&gt; v2.1 could be only ad=
justments to the the basket subassembly, or changes to improve the base sub=
assembly independently, or testing different material / color options)</li>=
<li>Switch to metric for everything (I see inches in some places, and even =
as an American I don&#39;t want to anymore, haha)</li><li>Migrate to using =
a single limit switch in the back of the machine by the perch hook (is ther=
e a redundancy reason for the two limit switches that I&#39;m missing maybe=
?)</li><li>Remove the perch hook and include it into the shape of the perch=
 platform</li><li>Find and utilize a standard adapter measurement for the b=
ase reinforcing ring / bolt holes in base panel (for this I mean something =

ell, or some other standard?)</li><li>Add more hex nut shapes that can be g=
lued on the inside (in the Final Assembly - Step 2 video, a couple nuts are=
 hot glued to the inside, but we should provide pieces like the included he=
x wrenches that can be glued in places with the washer/bolt -- this would a=
lso be part of idea 3)</li><li>Provide water resistant housing alternative =
to the sled (I&#39;d also like for this to better fit on the shelves / slid=
e in out / potentially be oriented vertically on the rear panel instead of =
horizontally and removing the front sled shelf)</li><li>Remove the need for=
 the soldering iron and related steps (I don&#39;t think we need to solder =
to the limit switch(es) or the alligator clips, crimping things should be e=
nough for solid contact, even in weathering conditions, right?)</li></ol>He=
re&#39;s a couple questions for you Josh. How concerned are we in terms of =

 expensive or anything, but it may be worth having some priorities for whic=
