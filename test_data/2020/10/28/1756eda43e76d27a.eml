I like the ability to change messaging as needed, but mostly as it allows
us to multivariate test and validate the assumptions that softer entry =3D=
=3D
better / stronger engagement.

As a counter, I think an intro video would be the strongest contender, and
would also allow us to get some initial feedback on the power of video at
that point in the platform.

Discuss tomorrow?
