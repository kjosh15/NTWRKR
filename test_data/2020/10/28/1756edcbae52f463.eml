He said:

"Officevibe was really helpful for a couple months - it sent out randomized
surveys and got good feedback, and some anonymous support.

I think at a certain point the formulaic reminders lose their impact - it
doesn't feel human.

I was hoping switching platforms would help but organic engagement has been
0 since I did and I haven't pushed people to start using it."

Interesting!
