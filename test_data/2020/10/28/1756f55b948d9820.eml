Carl,

I've been chatting with Avery Dennison (the RFID providers) and Chris Clark
(who is working with them under Rob Peterson). Based on my conversations
with both sides I think there's an opportunity to connect the dots between
the back end of the supply chain all the way through to the front of the
store, giving you an end-to-end data stream to analyze (and optimize!)
It'll take an internal retail champion, though - let me know if you've time
for a short call to discuss.

All best,
Josh
