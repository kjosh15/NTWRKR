 of now they&#39;re safely in their new home in Seattle! We hope you and Et=

 items we discussed in our last call. Let me know if I&#39;m getting too ta=
ctical here, but otherwise:<br><br>- Kids toys<br><br>Please do take a pict=
ure of the kids stuff Etukai was interested in. If our boys are ok with it =
he can continue playing with them and you can pack up and send everything e=
lse. Sound good?<br><br>- Harvard books<br><br>Can you pack these up and se=
nd these separately to my sister by December?<br><br>- General packing<br><=
br>You sensibly pointed out that we don&#39;t need to pay for storage until=
 December. That said, I&#39;d rather have our &quot;stuff to be stored&quot=
; list packed up earlier rather than later as we&#39;re hoping to be moving=
 down the road here soon and may want to ship it over for us there. When do=
 you think you could get our &quot;stuff to be stored&quot; list packed up?=
 That way you could leave packing everything else into storage in Dec.<br><=
br>- Oils and supplements<br><br>Feel free to use anything that&#39;s open,=
 and if you want anything that isn&#39;t just send us a snapshot and we&#39=
;ll figure out if it&#39;s expensive enough to be worth asking you to cover=
 at some discounted rate. Really appreciate your kindness here!<br><br>- Ki=
ds art supplies<br><br>Ditto in this case. Please use anything that isn&#39=
;t sealed / reusable if shipped; just take a picture of the latter and we&#=
39;ll figure it out. Happy to have you guys be well provisioned, and if you=
&#39;d be using it anyway let&#39;s save shipping stuff across the planet i=
f we can!<br><br>- The kids allowance jars<br><br>Thanks for telling us the=
 amount in each; are you going to just include it in the rent transfer?<br>=
<br>- Box of stuff to ship to us<br>=C2=A0<br>I&#39;ll set up a shipping la=
bel for you, hopefully before end of week!<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br></di=
