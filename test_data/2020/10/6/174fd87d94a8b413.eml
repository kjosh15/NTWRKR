Ellie,

Latest word from Jen was "Unfortunately Padma has had to reshuffle
priorities near term. I will confirm back with you in the next week or so
after I connect with her."

Padma wasn't cc'd, so I'll send her a brief email directly in a day or two
offering to adjust my schedule if she wants to move faster, but for now
this one seems neatly shelved. Would love any insight if you have it as to
what's going on there.

Separately, I'd like to loop back on consulting for Korn Ferry. As per our
first conversation, I'm keen to be a part of a team. Any thoughts?

All best,
Josh
