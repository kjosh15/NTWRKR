o do so themselves, then I think we have something that could run for multi=
ple seasons.<br><br>- One other idea: have A-listers who do NOT fit the voi=
ce of the person who wrote one side of the engagement read their text. I.e.=
, have Betty White read the text from a male black southern construction wo=
rker, or Brad Pitt read the text from an older woman from the upper east si=
de in NYC. Having a-list talent provides all the usual draws, and would fee=
d the pool of people who are willing to engage with the bot. <br><br>Techni=
cally, it occurs to me that we could just make a website where anyone could=
 log on and engage with the bot, but that this would be really easy to spam=
 and would favor younger folks. My suspicion is that email is our best bet,=
 and that if we require people to submit a photo to start the conversation =
that would filter even more strongly towards older and legitimate users. Th=
at&#39;s also asynchronous, which would be easier for GPT-3 to work with. <=
br><br>Finally, it may also be possible for the AI to source content to fee=
d the conversation. No idea if this would work well or not, but if we could=
 train an AI to review content sent to it (i.e., a &quot;fake news filter&q=
uot;) this could train people to spot fake news AND give us some great come=
dic content. Conversely, if a bot gave you a link and asked you if you thou=
ght it mattered to the conversation at hand that might be less confrontatio=
nal than a human being saying &quot;read the Wikipedia entry, asshole.&quot=
; Thoughts?<br><br>There&#39;s really something here, now, and I think that=
 as a proposal it&#39;s getting pretty undeniable. One last note; I&#39;m g=
oing to be a part of a summit in a month or so hosted by Trevor Noah. Might=
 be a chance for me to get his ear (virtually) to pitch the idea. Do you th=
ink that&#39;s a fit?<br><br>All best,<br>Josh<br></div><div hspace=3D"stre=
