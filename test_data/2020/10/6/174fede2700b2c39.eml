#######

To whom it may concern,

I've recently moved to Iceland and am keen to work with companies here,
either as an advisor or in new product development or technology strategy.
Most of my work has been in either the US (NYC/S.F.) or the EU (London /
Berlin primarily), but I've lectured at Bifrost and am reasonably familiar
with the startup scene here (mostly through Iceland Venture Studio).

Any advice you may have on connecting with companies that are looking for
more senior-level assistance, either internationally or strategically,
would be much appreciated. I bring access to a significant business network
after a decade's consulting work to senior executives of much of the
Fortune 500 as well as significant experience at companies like IDEO,
Corning, and others in developing new and innovative technology initiatives
and corporate strategy.

At present my goal is to build my experience with Icelandic companies and
establish credibility in the local business community. Any advice you have,
either on who to meet or how to connect effectively, would be very much
apprecaited.

My CV, Board CV, and presskit are attached, and more information is
available at my website (www.josh.is) and on linkedin (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaklein/).

Sincerely,
Joshua Klein
