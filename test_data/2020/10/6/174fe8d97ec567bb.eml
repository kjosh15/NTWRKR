Val,

Thanks again for the call earlier today; it was interesting to hear what
you're up to and I remain curious to see where you build to over the next
year or so!

In the meantime, this is the overview of the system we were going to use to
approach an academic institution around partnering on a study with a big
corporate client:

"IndigoMetrics is an expert system SaaS platform that uses short
peer-to-peer surveys on core organizational values to a) measure alignment
and engagement to same, and b) change human behavior autonomously and at
scale. As one of the first HR utilities to provide a statistical model for
behavior we've been able to collect an impressive data set of
bias-corrected behavior changes over time.

We're looking to conduct an academic study of the data to determine how,
where, and at what rate this change can be best effected. As computer
models and data collection expand, the potential for bad modeling and
unexpected effects is growing exponentially. We believe that the
IndigoMetrics platform provides an ideal proving ground for identifying and
preventing mistaken impacts, and improving positive outcomes."

Does this read right to you, and/or do you have any advice? I've attached
our overview deck to accompany the above.

Much obliged,
Josh
