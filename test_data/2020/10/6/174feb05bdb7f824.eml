Hi Josh,

It was good talking to you - thanks for reaching out, look forward to
staying in touch!

Reads well to me, though I'd put a more focus on changing / improving
corporate culture as opposed to changing individual behavior. I understand
the difference may seem trivial, but the former would resonate better with
Professors who study corporate culture and organizational blueprints.

I am surprised Wharton has lost interest, this seems to go well with the
School's People Analytics focus. There are a couple of Professors I can
reach out to so as to potentially restart the conversation and provide
feedback. Will keep you updated.

Best,
Val
