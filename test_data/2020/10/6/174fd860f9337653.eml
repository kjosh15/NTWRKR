OMFG yes yes and yes. In the same boat; we're moving to a farmhouse down
the road from my in-laws' place. Will be here until May, then no idea
either. Been working FT on my startup, which is growing nicely, but
otherwise just counting down the bank account. My money is, sadly, on
widespread conflict after Nov. :/ We're hosting a single dad and his son in
our apt. in Queens through the new year in exchange for his helping pack
our stuff up. Don't think we'll return for the next couple years, but who
the heck knows - as you noted, it's a weird time. Who's buying what now in
Iceland? We know a great realtor in Santa Rosa (my beloved aunt)!

Sounds like you're as busy as I am, but I'd love to chat sometime if you're
game. Being dislocated like this is, well, dislocating, and I'm finding now
more than ever that there are people my heart trusts and grows in the
presence of and those that it doesn't, and I'm very keen to cultivate the
former. Let me know if you find yourself with a moment
