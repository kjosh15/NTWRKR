Sure, no hurry.  I'm very interested to see how he responds.

It turns out, after staring at it for a while, that I'd entered the zone 
version number as "2020010010" instead of "2020100100", and 2020010010 < 
2020092700 so anyone caching the old zone file (including our secondary, 
YGTimber) thought that the last one they had was newer.  Anyway, you 
should start seeing the DMARC records any time now.

Thanks,
