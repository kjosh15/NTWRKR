Toys: Yes

General packing: agreed
Kids art supplies: of course
The kids allowance jars: of course, as long as we make sure the kids
receive the money on our end
Box of stuff to ship to us: Ship now I guess. How do we make sure it
doesn't get stuck in the toll this time. Make sure our Icelandic
phonenumbers are included?

love you!
