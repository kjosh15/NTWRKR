This guy seems super engaged and is doing some interesting stuff, but I
don't have the bandwidth to support him. How do you feel about putting the
designs up on GIT or similar and letting him fork away? I don't want to
suppress evolution of the work, but I don't get the sense either of us are
about to go shoot a bunch of video or troubleshoot experimental designs for
users, either. Thoughts?

I hope all's well on your end; life here in Iceland is increasingly surreal=
!

The biggest concern we have is that as a hobby project we don't have the
time to support new versions. The videos have been tremendously successful
in allowing people to make their own boxes, and having different versions
would necessitate new videos, which is a huge time cost.


Yup, and thanks for getting back to me about it! I=E2=80=99m in no rush or =
anything.

I=E2=80=99ve been having fun with my work around it, and want to see if may=
be the
local crows to Denver will be more motivated to learn the machine in the
winter / dearth months. That=E2=80=99s primarily what my effort is around.

The video thing is a shared concern and one I totally understand. It=E2=80=
=99s
entirely up to you if you don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s worth doing ag=
ain and I
understand if it=E2=80=99s not at this time. I=E2=80=99m still going to do =
this work, and
will contribute it back in either a way you prefer, or by putting it up on
GitHub with some documentation and notes while I beta test the designs.

I've gotten to nerd out on it, haha, and that=E2=80=99s largely what matter=
s to me.
You=E2=80=99re welcome to use what I end up with or not, it=E2=80=99s a sha=
re-alike kinda
deal, so I=E2=80=99m here for that if it=E2=80=99s accepted, and I=E2=80=99=
ll do my best to
document it well and resolve anything that comes up in my beta testing.

Anyway, I=E2=80=99ve done a lot of the things I set out to do, and believe =
I=E2=80=99ve
lowered the costs.

The following is from what I=E2=80=99ve documented, and you=E2=80=99re by n=
o means
obligated to read it. Haha

1. Reduced cost - to do this I=E2=80=99ve consolidated to a single color. T=
he
design now fits onto one color sheet, a transparent sheet, and a styrene
sheet. This minimizes the uploads to 3, as the design fits within a single
790mm x 384mm sheet, but does limit the material choices a bit. Two colors
can be achieved by ordering two colors and building two boxes. I did this
because I'd like to run experiments on color performance, so a single sheet
was important, as was the ability to swap out the basket / and housing
subassemblies =E2=80=94 transparency might allow some birds to feel more
comfortable if they can see the inner workings?

2. Separated the design into two main subassemblies that fit together in a
"slide into place" locking fashion. This removes the side access panel and
allows the majority of the front to be removed for servicing without any
fasteners (I=E2=80=99m going to beta test this obviously =E2=80=94 but hypo=
thetically it'll
work, haha.) This necessitated shifting the limit switches to the side
panels, and I think improves some other aspects that I=E2=80=99ll be verify=
ing.

3. Added an enclosure for the primary electronics so that portion can be
=E2=80=9Cweatherproofed=E2=80=9D independently of the main housing as this =
was one of my
main worries for my climate. If not needed, this can be used as the
standard electronics sled without building it out =E2=80=94 but I have this=
 mounted
vertically now which might help with moisture retention around the Arduino.

So from my original list:

   1. Added drainage holes to all four corners of the bottom panel.
   2. Moved power hole to the bottom.
   3. Implemented the two subassembly concept, without any fasteners, but
   may expand on this during testing.
   4. Everything is on the metric system and in the raw files almost every
   point is snapped to a mm.
   5. Tested and verified moving the limit switch to the back doesn=E2=80=
=99t work,
   so shifted them to the side panels.
   6. Removed the perch hook and adjusted the perch to include that
   functionality (consider doubling this layer as it=E2=80=99s likely the w=
eakest
   point from hail.)
   7. Still working to find some universal standard for mounting bolts but
   haven=E2=80=99t yet.
   8. Will expand on the concept of fasteners if needed, but might just use
   hitch pins on #3 if anything is needed at all.
   9. Provided an enclosed electronics sled as an optional build aspect.
   10. Verified that soldering is not required unless you=E2=80=99re not us=
ing
   Dupont wires.


Other things:

   1. Improved the coin magazine =E2=80=94 made transparent, added a top th=
at can
   be fastened using hitch pins, and the feet have been improved to be
   interlocked for stability.
   2. All electronic, sensors, and switches are part of the housing, so the
   basket can be removed easily.
   3. The basket is slightly wider and taller now, though I doubt this is
   adding very many sq-cm of additional food.
   4. The basket spine and ramp support stringers slide through from the
   back of the face plate of the basket subassembly now, which provides mor=
e
   stability for the basket.
   5. A lot of the shapes from the basket window have been removed, and
   using 3mm bolts/nuts is optional if additional support is needed (but I
   don=E2=80=99t think it will be)
   6. The rail frames mimic the interlocking design of the side panels of
   the housing, which allows things to be mounted internally (electronics
   enclosure).
   7. The perch tensioner also allows internally mounted things
   (electronics sled).

Stoked to read all this - you're right, a simpler way to fork the designs
would probably be useful. The biggest concern we have is that as a hobby

and having different versions would necessitate new videos, which is a huge
time cost.

Before tackling that, though, let me address your specific questions:

- How concerned are we in terms of cost associated with the housing build?

This has been the top priority. A lot of folks wanted a pre-fabbed kit, for
example, but initial estimates showed that they didn't want to pay more
than $50 for it. We've managed to come in at around $100 for parts, which
we consider a huge success.

That said, it's a new world. It might be worth including a link or testing
out what people would pay for a newer, pre-fabbed version. Is this
something you're interested in, or was your question purely aimed at parts
costs?

- Priority: I'd say cost of build, quality/durability, simplicity of build,
and simplicity in ordering. There hasn't been much noise around color
choices.

Let me know your thoughts on the above!

e been working on building a crowbox and my brain has totally latched onto =
this as something I&#39;d like to chip in some of my free time this winter =
on. Thanks so much for all of your efforts everybody, Josh especially. It&#=
39;s been really fun to start working on building one, and that&#39;s very =
much attributed to your massive efforts and all of the material that&#39;s =
been put together so far.<div><br></div><div>I remember your ted talk from =
way back and have always loved the idea. After some googling I ended up on =
your project. I was just going to hack together some things from a now defu=
nct automatic dog feeder I have sitting around, but this is so much better!=
<div><br></div><div>@Josh, what are your thoughts on creating a repo or two=
 on github or gitlab? One for the code, and one for the shape files and pdf=
 print templates etc? I&#39;d consider forking the shape files and making s=
ome proposed modifications to them -- I&#39;ve got a lot of ideas floating =
around -- not really &quot;waterproofing it&quot;, but minimizing water dam=
age potential and making it more weather resistant (I&#39;m in Colorado so =
get to do real world testing, haha).</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some=
 of the ideas I&#39;ve formed so far and will bring as proposals if we had =
things up on github or gitlab. I know full well that a lot of these things =
may necessitate re-recording some of the really amazing videos at some time=
 in the future, but I&#39;ve got a couple solutions about how some division=
 in the housing will make it easier to version things, including generating=
 new videos in the future.</div><div><ol><li>Add drainage on base panel (dr=
ainage holes in all four corners, and small grid of drainage hopes near the=
 coin sensor assembly / coin entrance)</li><li>Move power supply hole to th=
e bottom</li><li>Make the front/basket subassembly replaceable using 3m nut=
s/bolts/washers=C2=A0(this would allow for minor versions -- v2.0 -&gt; v2.=
1 could be only adjustments to the the basket subassembly, or changes to im=
prove the base subassembly independently, or testing different material / c=
olor options)</li><li>Switch to metric for everything (I see inches in some=
 places, and even as an American I don&#39;t want to anymore, haha)</li><li=
>Migrate to using a single limit switch in the back of the machine by the p=
erch hook (is there a redundancy reason for the two limit switches that I&#=
39;m missing maybe?)</li><li>Remove the perch hook and include it into the =
shape of the perch platform</li><li>Find and utilize a standard adapter mea=
surement for the base reinforcing ring / bolt holes in base panel (for this=
 I mean something like=C2=A0<a href=3D"https://www.globalindustrial.com/g/p=
lumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-flanges" target=3D"_blank">https=
://www.globalindustrial.com/g/plumbing/fittings/brass-fittings/brass-face-f=
langes</a><span>=C2=A0</span>-- are there international options for this ki=
nd of thing as well, or some other standard?)</li><li>Add more hex nut shap=
es that can be glued on the inside (in the Final Assembly - Step 2 video, a=
 couple nuts are hot glued to the inside, but we should provide pieces like=
 the included hex wrenches that can be glued in places with the washer/bolt=
 -- this would also be part of idea 3)</li><li>Provide water resistant hous=
ing alternative to the sled (I&#39;d also like for this to better fit on th=
e shelves / slide in out / potentially be oriented vertically on the rear p=
anel instead of horizontally and removing the front sled shelf)</li><li>Rem=
ove the need for the soldering iron and related steps (I don&#39;t think we=
 need to solder to the limit switch(es) or the alligator clips, crimping th=
ings should be enough for solid contact, even in weathering conditions, rig=
ht?)</li></ol>Here&#39;s a couple questions for you Josh. How concerned are=
 we in terms of cost associated with the housing build? I don&#39;t plan on=
 making it super expensive or anything, but it may be worth having some pri=
orities for which things I can/we optimize towards?<br><div><br></div><div>=
Like, build quality/durability, simplicity of build, simplicity in ordering=
, cost of build, flexibility in versioning / color options (I want to do th=
is purely so I can test different colors), flexibility in options (for inst=
ance, the housing alternative to the sled), etc.</div></div><div><br></div>=
<div>Thanks again! It&#39;s been really enjoyable to work on the crowbox so=
 far, and if I can, I&#39;d be happy to help out in other ways too. I&#39;m=
 a software engineer, and am interested in discussing the code / hardware a=
s well -- including a raspberry pi implementation, but that&#39;s an entire=
ly different topic and one I haven&#39;t dived into fully yet.</div></div><=
