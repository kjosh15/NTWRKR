Don't see how good, regular work is unfortunate - especially these days!!

Things here are definitely interesting, although I'm not sure I'd say
that's full of win atm. Lots of high-risk, high-value opportunities that
won't result in anything for quite some time. So maybe more exciting than
interesting... although clearly this is what I prefer, so no complaints!

+1 on missing Halloween. We're planning to have the cousins over to trick
or treat, but it's a super weird exercise as they don't understand why you
need to ring the doorbell at a house of people you already know and are
going to just go into anyway... 8D

Ring us on Facetime anytime mornings EST; always glad to see you guys!
