Holly,

Dr. Epstein of AIBRT recently sent out some grant info and I noticed you
were included; I'm not sure how you've been working with him but was hoping
you could tell me about WhatIf. I've been stalking them online for a while
now and would love to know more - are you enjoying working with them, and
do you recommend them for technology transformation/strategy work?

Apologies for the cold outreach, and very much obliged!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
=E1=90=A7
