Curious to catch up with you on your thoughts about the call yesterday.
They brought up excellent feedback, but I want to keep them engaged in the
evolution of the platform. Some ideas:

1. Create the four "types" of rollout (gentle to harsh) and ask for
feedback on how they'd use them,
2. Send them some of the intro / rollout / onboarding stuff we've made for
other companies and ask if that feels right for their clients,
3. Write a short intro/onboarding script for a 1-minute video and ask for
feedback (could be helpful for video)

Once we get feedback on any of the above we can start asking about how they
could test these out with potential clients.

Given that we're concurrently getting the site up I don't want to push too
much in too many directions, but it sounds like they thought the tool was
very interesting but found it very challenging to use (especially in the
middle of a pandemic). I want to get them back into thinking about how to
use it with clients, and keeping them looped in to how to change it to fit
their client needs seems like the best bet. Does this echo your experience
with Lane 4 / do you have any insights on driving them to acquire customers
similarly?
