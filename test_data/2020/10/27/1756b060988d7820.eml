Everyone I know is trying to figure out how to build worthwhile =
relationships in the pandemic. But with virtualization, 99% of everything =
is turning out to be spam.

I figured I'd try something different. We've =
worked together before, and more importantly you're someone I *enjoyed* =
working with, and would work with again. Below is a shortlist of my current=
 projects; reply with an update on your current projects, or let's schedule=
 a time and chat!

Looking forward to reconnecting,
Josh

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.=
com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for autonomously managing =
behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!

Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20

Professional Services(http://www.josh.is/): as ever, I continue to work =
with senior leaders and teams on technology transformation and new =
innovation / product development.
