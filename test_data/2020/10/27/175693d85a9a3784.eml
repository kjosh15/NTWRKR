Sanjay,

Thanks so much for the thoughtful questions! My "hand wavy" fears in terms
of the foresight space mostly stem from the fact that I have participated
in numerous forecasting exercises, but had no formal training, and am often
asked to speak definitively to a breadth of technical issues in regards to
same. Sitting at the intersection of future possibility and existing
technical capability is exciting, but the natural human inclination to seek
expertise as certainty puts me in (what I perceive as) a precarious
position. Does that make sense?

By all means let's reconnect - the next couple weeks are a little packed,
but can you find a time here <http://josh.is/scheduling> that works for you=
?

All best,
Josh
