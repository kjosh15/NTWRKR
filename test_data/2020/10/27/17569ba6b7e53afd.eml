Margret,

Thank you so, so much for the call earlier today! I left feeling very much
inspired and encouraged about doing great work in Iceland. A few points of
follow up:

- I'll check with gather.co and see where they stand on an Icelandic
branch. Could be a great way for freelance / experts to connect to the
Icelandic market!

- I'll keep an ear open for Unity developers. Forgot to ask: are you
willing / able to hire internationally?

- You'd suggested three introductions:

; a woman who is mega-networker in the startup area

; someone doing technology strategy with the gov't tech office

; someone working in Icelandic exports

How's this for an introduction:

"Josh has recently moved from NYC to Iceland, where he built a successful
freelance technology consultancy, bringing with him an extensive network of
senior executives from multinationals across the Fortune 500. He's also
been active in the startup community in the US, advising numerous startups
directly, building an incubator for IMAX, and working with accelerators
like Singularity Institute and Alchemy Ventures. More info is available at
www.josh.is."

I've also attached my presskit and am happy to customize the above however
you think might be helpful!

Gratefully,
Josh
