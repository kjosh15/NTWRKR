Frederick,

Been mulling over how to tempt Carl to engage sooner rather than later. How
about something like:

"Carl,

I've been chatting with Avery Dennison (the RFID providers Chris Clark is
working with under Rob Peterson). Based on my conversations with both sides
I think there's an opportunity to connect the dots between the back end of
the supply chain all the way through to the front of the store, giving you
an end-to-end data stream to analyze (and optimize!) It'll take an internal
retail champion, though - let me know if you're game for a short call to
discuss!

All best,
Josh"

Thoughts?
