Adrian,<br>
<br>
Thanks for reaching out to (mt) MediaTemple!<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve applied the credit from the Managed WordPress hosting over to the =
new DV w/SSD and started at the rate we discussed previously at $440 for th=
e year. A remaining charge of $200 is now on the account and you can just s=
ubmit payment to get it provisioned right away.<br>
<br>
Did you also want to add on migration services provided by our Advance Supp=
ort team? That would be $100 per site so just reply back letting us know th=
e number of sites you want to have Advance Support migrate for you and I ca=
n get that added as well.<br>
<br>
Just reply back to this Support Request in your (mt) MediaTemple Account Ce=
nter and I can update the charges accordingly.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
