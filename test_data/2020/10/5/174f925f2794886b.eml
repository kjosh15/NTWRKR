Frederick,

Thanks for the deck - am I free to pass this on to my contact at Google,
and/or is there anyone I can mention in conjunction with your work there
yet or would you rather I passed this on cold?

Separately, I reached out to Carl and will update you as soon as I hear
back. If experience is any guide it'll take a few rounds of followup to get
him, but I'm hopeful it'll lead to a call where we can disambiguate where
he wants me to sit (if anywhere) in relation to the project.

Finally, let me know where/who/how to approach working with AD on
development of new projects. I'm guessing I'm one of a pretty small group
of people who have run antenna arrays in their apartments, and I'd love to
jump in on a project to help clients realize the potential of all the
solutions you have available. Let me know where to start this conversation!

All best,
Josh
