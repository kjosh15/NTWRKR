Hi Josh

Great to hear from you! I hope all is well with you, and with your family. W=
e are doing well and feel blessed in many ways.  I would love to talk someti=
me if you want to.=20

I am interested in your virtual network theory applied more with a ministry f=
ocus think there=E2=80=99s a lot of benefit potentially in that area.=20

I am working with ECCMA to advance quality data exchange across the supply c=
hain and prevent data locked-in by the different applications.

Things are going well with my activities that involve finding common interes=
t platforms to serve others from a ministry perspective.  I have about 7-8 m=
en in their 20s early 30s that are responding well to woodworking, music or o=
utdoor activities like camping, hiking and sailing and I=E2=80=99m really en=
joying time with them. we grow together in the interest area, and many other=
 parts of life open up for mentoring spiritually or with career or emotional=
ly. We both grow and get some from it.   It=E2=80=99s pretty cool and Contac=
ts  keep growing. my problem will be I can only do so many deeper relationsh=
ips and I=E2=80=99ll run out of time personally. So now I=E2=80=99m trying t=
o figure out how to find others with the same type of viewpoint with maybe o=
ther interest areas and multiply the impact.
