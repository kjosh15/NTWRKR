Haakon thought this was pretty funny! He wanted to make a drawing in
response; his school is setting him up with Seesaw, which has a fun
sketching platform - that=E2=80=99s how Othinn made the Sir Haakon picture =
- so
hopefully we=E2=80=99ll be able to support that shortly!

Lots of love,
Josh
