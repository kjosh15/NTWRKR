Othinn,

My friend Konrad wants you to read his short story and tell him:

- Whenever there is something you don't understand, make a note
where (and ideally what).  This could really be anything, from "why are
there sleepers on the railway line" to "why doesn't character X do this
instead?"

- Most importantly, if there are boring parts I'd like to know
where they are.

The story is on the Kindle. Can I hire you to do this for 1000 ISK?

xoxo,
Josh
