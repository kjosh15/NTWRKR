All best,

Have not seen the word panopticon in print since reading some Foucault last
year.  The perfect word for the situation.  Till September.

Really, really wanted to say something clever after that Grandmaster Flash
comment, but everything sounded like I was either trying to be hip hop, or
pornography.

So instead, how about you ping me when you get back from CA and we set up a
time? As I understand it you've got an interest in the emerging panopticon
that is our modern technolopolitical first world society. I've done a lot
of work setting up and breaking down parts of it and would be curious what
you think!

best,
Josh

have (both in California, unfortunately - Jeffrey is too busy to play
anymore ) is that the game be in doubt over time.  For me it is an
opportunity to enjoy extended conversation, a sipping Scotch - the night
games, and a metaphoric detour.  Like a good book, the process of the move
takes me out of the "real" world, which I am often eager to escape.

We will be in NY until 7/17, when we leave for a few weeks with in-laws and
a underused motorcycle in southern California.  Most of my time is spent
writing or researching, so my time is relatively flexible.  I usually work
in cafes, dividing my time between 'Wichcraft (20/5th), City Bakery
(18/5th), and Gray Dog (16/7th).  We live on W. 16, just off of 5th.

Pleasure to meet you! I once got a draw from a grand master, but he was
almost too drunk to walk. Same principle, presumably. Would love to get
together for some chess or otherwise; we've got a new baby so will probably
miss the 4th, but am happy to connect after. What times are good for you?

Jeff, thanks for the intro!! Moving you to bcc to spare you the logistics.

Best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

Don't know anything about you other than it seems you are a writer as well,
but Jeffrey's a fairly reliable source for recommendations.  If you'd like
to have a conversation in person, let me know.  Also, my wife and I will be
at the Fourth of July festivities at the Chelsea Piers 'Wichcraft Thursday
night - just in case you were planning to be there.  As for chess, I'll
bring you up to date on our record when I see you.  I'll give you a hint in
the meantime.  Over the course of ten years, one of us has won only one
game, and the other guy, the older guy, was drunk when that happened.  If
you play, I'm always up for a game.

Josh meet Richard
Richard meet Josh

Richard,

I was sharing a beer with Josh this week and mentioned to him your new
play.  As I mentioned to you in the past, Josh has just turned in his
manuscript for a book on Reputation in a digital world.  I am probably not
doing it any justice here, but you two should connect on many levels even
if you just start with the topic at hand.

Josh,

Richard is a dear friend of about 10 years, brilliant writer, philosopher
and terrible chess player (inside joke).

Have fun, you two.

Best,

Jeffrey
