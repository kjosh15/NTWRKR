meone suggested stepping power down to 5 volts and THEN running power acros=
s a lawn/terrain to the box, but we don&#39;t know offhand of a good cable =
(that is, a nice long cable) that can carry 5VDC a long distance and not al=
so involve loss of precious voltage. Mainly because we never explored it so=
 we don&#39;t have a good idea of cost, and we don&#39;t have data on volta=
ge loss (to wire resistance) across that distance. In the current plans, we=
 very strongly suggest (demand, really) that users employ a GFCI outlet and=
/or an in-line GFCI with their A/C extension cord to promote safety. If the=
re&#39;s anyone out there who has time/interest/capability to research this=
 we&#39;d love to publish their results!<br><br>2) Portable power. The dema=
nd for this seems huge and we did limited preliminary testing quite some ti=
me ago, but with some discouraging results. We tested five banks and only t=
he VOLTAIC brand properly worked on low-current devices without shutting it=
self off. The nominal use-case these devices are designed for means that 95=
% of them have auto-shutoff functions which are largely unlabeled. That sai=
d, while Voltaic power banks are a little expensive they&#39;re less expens=
ive than most in-line GFCI switches for extension cords and so could be a g=
ood tradeoff for many people. Is anyone out there able to do an updated stu=
dy on currently available Voltaic banks to see which ones DON&#39;T have th=
e auto-shut-off feature so we can point people at good alternatives?<br><br=
>Much obliged,<br>Josh<br><br>P.S. In case you&#39;re skimming the above DO=
N&#39;T JUST BUY a cheap 30,000mAh power bank from Amazon and expect it to =
work! The only vendor we found that produced a workable power bank that did=
n&#39;t auto-shutoff was Voltaic, and that was some time ago. Updated resea=
rch is needed.<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-mark" style=3D"max-height:=
