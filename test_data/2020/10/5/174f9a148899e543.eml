Thanks for this, Josh. Now back in the US, Vermont specifically.

Yes, I hear you on not attempting to convert the other side, as it would =
offend. I think you nailed it further down in your email when you said =
that it=E2=80=99s going to be key to find Americans who perceive their =
views in a lighter way. We want them to be willing to see the other =
side, otherwise it=E2=80=99ll never work. Casting is going to be so =
crucial to this series. We=E2=80=99ll actually need a news producer. =
This is what their job involves often times, finding individuals that =
fit certain political and emotional profiles.

Reading further into your email, this is great: =E2=80=9C=E2=80=A6that =
at a certain level there is a desire for unity. If we can give voice to =
that - if we can have each episode close with two people who were =
diametrically opposed demonstrating how they connected over something =
which previously made them act hatefully towards each other - then we're =
giving people hope.=E2=80=9D

Formatting notes below.

Reconciliation: I=E2=80=99ve thought about the reconciliation quite a =
bit, as an element of the program. The issue for me is dependency. We =
don=E2=80=99t want the show to be dependent on it because 1) it might =
not happen and 2) it might get too cheesy too quickly. I think this =
should attempt to remain emotionally non-partisan, as well as =
politically. Let=E2=80=99s all be adults about this and perceive of our =
intensity around these issues in a way that makes them less important, =
rather than more important. Meaning, reconciliation is dependent on the =
idea that what was being discussed is important, that views and opinions =
on divisive issues are important. But really, we=E2=80=99re trying to =
send the opposite idea.

Expert: Fair point regarding the partisanship of the =E2=80=9Cexpert." =
But if there was a historian, someone who can give us the backstory to =
the issue at hand, that might be helpful. We=E2=80=99ll need some sort =
of unbiased raw information, something that can=E2=80=99t be perceived =
of as questionable truths. Academics typically are great sources of =
nonpartisanship. But not always=E2=80=A6 Another option could be a =
=E2=80=9Ccorrespondent=E2=80=9D type role, someone who fills in the =
audience on the history of the program. I=E2=80=99ve seen a Chinese =
propaganda program <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Got_It_Right> =
about Marxism that somewhat reminds me of what we=E2=80=99re talking =
about. I mean that strictly in terms of format, correspondents, etc. =
(That=E2=80=99s a dangerous sentence otherwise!)

Voting: Yes, the voting might be over the top. I agree, especially as it =
once again reinforces divisions.

Celebrities: This is a brilliant suggestion. But they=E2=80=99d have to =
be celebrities with no publicly facing opinions on the topics we choose. =
But I love this.

Highlighting funny interactions: There is a challenge here. On one hand, =
humor is a draw. But on the other hand, it=E2=80=99s divisive=E2=80=94at =
least, often times. There=E2=80=99s a deeper idea and challenge here =
regarding how to craft a nighttime program that doesn=E2=80=99t rely on =
negativity bias. I watch Trevor Noah because he is so ludicrously funny =
as it pertains to putting down those who don=E2=80=99t share my opinion. =
But how to craft an entertaining program that doesn=E2=80=99t rely on =
such things, one someone would want to watch after they get home from =
work, this is the challenge. As you said, we=E2=80=99re giving Americans =
a =E2=80=9Croadmap for healing=E2=80=9D (brilliantly put).

AI emails: Okay. This is it=E2=80=94this is how we can get content for =
the program itself. Yes, 100% onboard with this=E2=80=94if we can get it =
to work. Having the ability to ask and chat with the =E2=80=9CAI opinion =
swayer,=E2=80=9D will be a fascinating thing to generate hype about the =
program as well. It reminds me of John Oliver=E2=80=99s push to get =
folks to visit domains he=E2=80=99s purchased for each episode. But =
there is one centralized second screen experience, one site or one =
second functionality that people can focus around before, during and =
after the program. In some ways, this is like having an unlimited =
opportunity to speak intimately with the host of a program=E2=80=94but =
on a mass scale, anytime, anywhere.

Trevor Noah: Yes, 100%. This is an incredible opportunity to get this in =
his ear=E2=80=94and he is possible the person to speak to about such a =
show. I suspect we should get this all in order rather quickly then. =
When is the event?=20

Are you available to chat around these ideas sometime this week?=20

Thanks,
Matt

I don't suggest we try to convert the other, as I expect that would =
offend both, but if we position it as using AI to help each side engage =
with and understand the other - especially if it's about highly =
contentious topics - there's a very real power there. After all, this is =

Usually experts have a strong opinion. Or am I missing the gist here?

an ok option. What needs to be non-optional is welcoming the engagement =

and is where using the AI as "other" could be really powerful. No?
>=20
> - Highlighting funny interactions sounds ideal, *especially where it =

Again, if we make the focus of the program be about lauding Americans =
who are willing to engage and reconsider the "other side", and providing =
a narrative for average folks to do so themselves, then I think we have =
something that could run for multiple seasons.
>=20

Betty White read the text from a male black southern construction =

to start the conversation that would filter even more strongly towards =
older and legitimate users. That's also asynchronous, which would be =
easier for GPT-3 to work with.=20

great comedic content. Conversely, if a bot gave you a link and asked =

less confrontational than a human being saying "read the Wikipedia =

class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Reconciliation: I=E2=80=99ve thought =
about the reconciliation quite a bit, as an element of the program. The =
issue for me is dependency. We don=E2=80=99t want the show to be =
dependent on it because 1) it might not happen and 2) it might get too =
cheesy too quickly. I think this should attempt to remain emotionally =
non-partisan, as well as politically. Let=E2=80=99s all be adults about =
this and perceive of our intensity around these issues in a way that =
makes them less important, rather than more important. Meaning, =
reconciliation is dependent on the idea that what was being discussed is =
important, that views and opinions on divisive issues are important. But =
really, we=E2=80=99re trying to send the opposite idea.</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Expert: Fair point =
regarding the partisanship of the =E2=80=9Cexpert." But if there was a =
historian, someone who can give us the backstory to the issue at hand, =
that might be helpful. We=E2=80=99ll need some sort of unbiased raw =
information, something that can=E2=80=99t be perceived of as =
questionable truths. Academics typically are great sources of =
nonpartisanship. But not always=E2=80=A6 Another option could be a =
=E2=80=9Ccorrespondent=E2=80=9D type role, someone who fills in the =
audience on the history of the program. I=E2=80=99ve seen a =
Chinese&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Got_It_Right" =
class=3D"">propaganda program</a>&nbsp;about Marxism that somewhat =
reminds me of what we=E2=80=99re talking about. I mean that strictly in =
terms of format, correspondents, etc. (That=E2=80=99s a dangerous =
sentence otherwise!)</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =

interactions: There is a challenge here. On one hand, humor is a draw. =
But on the other hand, it=E2=80=99s divisive=E2=80=94at least, often =
times. There=E2=80=99s a deeper idea and challenge here regarding how to =
craft a nighttime program that doesn=E2=80=99t rely on negativity bias. =
I watch Trevor Noah because he is so ludicrously funny as it pertains to =
putting down those who don=E2=80=99t share my opinion. But how to craft =
an entertaining program that doesn=E2=80=99t rely on such things, one =
someone would want to watch after they get home from work, this is the =
challenge. As you said, we=E2=80=99re giving Americans a =E2=80=9Croadmap =
for healing=E2=80=9D (brilliantly put).</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">AI emails: Okay. This is it=E2=80=94this =
is how we can get content for the program itself. Yes, 100% onboard with =
this=E2=80=94if we can get it to work. Having the ability to ask and =
chat with the =E2=80=9CAI opinion swayer,=E2=80=9D will be a fascinating =
thing to generate hype about the program as well. It reminds me of John =
Oliver=E2=80=99s push to get folks to visit domains he=E2=80=99s =
purchased for each episode. But there is one centralized second screen =
experience, one site or one second functionality that people can focus =
around before, during and after the program. In some ways, this is like =
having an unlimited opportunity to speak intimately with the host of a =
program=E2=80=94but on a mass scale, anytime, anywhere.</div><div =

Again, my apologies.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">"A late-night program =
without the scorn and using repetitive, data-driven elements to ease =
tension between Americans" sounds AMAZING. I'm really curious to push =
this idea further, but you had me with this line alone. <br class=3D""><br=
 class=3D"">I love the idea of using AI to help both sides engage with =
each other. I don't suggest we try to convert the other, as I expect =
that would offend both, but if we position it as using AI to help each =
side engage with and understand the other - especially if it's about =
highly contentious topics - there's a very real power there. After all, =
this is the extremist element Facebook, Twitter, etc. have all exploited =
to our planet's detriment. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">One of the =
ideas here that I keep coming back to is that Americans particularly are =
seeing just how divided their country is, and that at a certain level =
there is a desire for unity. If we can give voice to that - if we can =
have each episode close with two people who were diametrically opposed =
demonstrating how they connected over something which previously made =
them act hatefully towards each other - then we're giving people hope. =
<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">More than that, we're giving Americans a =
roadmap for healing. The US has always been strong *because* of its core =
values, and those values include diversity. We just need to be shown how =
we are strong in embracing that. Having an AI spell out and guide us to =
finding that conversation - that "OK, I disagree but can still respect =
you" baseline value - could be enormously powerful. <br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">A few notes on format:<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- If we =
could have two of those our AI had the conversations with here to the =
studio to reread their exchanges on air always featuring a =
reconciliation or emotionally powerful reckoning that would be even =
better, no?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- Not sure if having an expert =
wouldn't cause more divisiveness. Usually experts have a strong opinion. =
Or am I missing the gist here?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">- I love the =
idea of halting the show for people to vote about whether someone =
changes their mind, BUT this essentially pits everyone who participates =
against the AI. If the goal is to create unity, then we need to leave =
the door open to NOT changing your mind. That needs to be an ok option. =
What needs to be non-optional is welcoming the engagement with the other =
side. That's the part that I think has been most missing, and is where =
using the AI as "other" could be really powerful. No?<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">- Highlighting funny interactions sounds ideal, *especially =
where it makes people who are unwilling to engage or reconsider look =
foolish.* Again, if we make the focus of the program be about lauding =
Americans who are willing to engage and reconsider the "other side", and =
providing a narrative for average folks to do so themselves, then I =
think we have something that could run for multiple seasons.<br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">- One other idea: have A-listers who do NOT =
fit the voice of the person who wrote one side of the engagement read =
their text. I.e., have Betty White read the text from a male black =
southern construction worker, or Brad Pitt read the text from an older =
woman from the upper east side in NYC. Having a-list talent provides all =
the usual draws, and would feed the pool of people who are willing to =
engage with the bot. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">Technically, it =
occurs to me that we could just make a website where anyone could log on =
and engage with the bot, but that this would be really easy to spam and =
would favor younger folks. My suspicion is that email is our best bet, =
and that if we require people to submit a photo to start the =
conversation that would filter even more strongly towards older and =
legitimate users. That's also asynchronous, which would be easier for =
GPT-3 to work with. <br class=3D""><br class=3D"">Finally, it may also =
be possible for the AI to source content to feed the conversation. No =
idea if this would work well or not, but if we could train an AI to =
review content sent to it (i.e., a "fake news filter") this could train =
people to spot fake news AND give us some great comedic content. =
Conversely, if a bot gave you a link and asked you if you thought it =
mattered to the conversation at hand that might be less confrontational =
than a human being saying "read the Wikipedia entry, asshole." =
Thoughts?<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">There's really something here, =
now, and I think that as a proposal it's getting pretty undeniable. One =
last note; I'm going to be a part of a summit in a month or so hosted by =
Trevor Noah. Might be a chance for me to get his ear (virtually) to =
pitch the idea. Do you think that's a fit?<br class=3D""><br =
