Just spoke to Laurel, the CEO, who recently gave a talk to W50 on
distributed work. They're working on getting their methodologies in place
but could really use some data and are really excited about the platform.
She suggested they'd be in a better place to dig in after a month or so so
I'll keep after them, but wanted to give you a heads up in the meantime.
Could be an interesting new 3rd party user.

best,
Josh
