I'm a fan of paranoia. :) I'll send you the last thread we shared - I
haven't spoken to Jeff in years, and my reason for reconnecting is that I'm
trying to figure out how to build a useful network in an era of rampant
virtualization, rather than just spamming the hell out of everyone (which
seems to be the prevailing trend). When I went back through all my older
connections I tried to pull out the ones that had question marks attached -
people I thought were interesting and worth following up with, but who I'd
lost touch or hadn't connected with. As for what to accomplish, I'd hope we
could find some way to help each other further our respective projects. And
finally, Jeff only introduced you as Richard... although I'll admit that
last question made me curious.

Let me know if all that's enough to pique your interest in turn!

All best,
Josh
