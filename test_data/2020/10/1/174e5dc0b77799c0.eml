Just following up: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, and to =
see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the =
view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's worth =
scheduling a brief call(https://josh.is/scheduling)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest Click =

929/aylin%40google.com/f37a0d74-107e-4645-9d82-f3aff74b2c1b) and I'll make =
sure not to pester you in the future!

Current Projects:

IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.=
com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an AI platform for autonomously managing =
behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful if you've got staff that =
are now remote!=20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Professional Services(http://www.josh.is): as ever, I continue to work with=
 senior leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / =
product development.

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this =
outreach, there is a whitepaper here(https://docs.google.=
com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0-BG_0/edit?=
