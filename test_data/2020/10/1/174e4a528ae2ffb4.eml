Carl,

Heard back from Rob that Chris Clark was working with Bob Pernice (of Avery
Dennison) as part of their extended Track & Trace team. Chris invited me to
jump into the conversation if I felt he needed me.

My impression is that there's a lot more potential. How did you see my
involvement from here? Let me know if a quick call would be helpful.
