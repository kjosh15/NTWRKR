Chris,

We have neither SPF nor DKIM for IndigoMetrics that I can see in our DNZ
Zone record. I can add both, but wanted to make sure it won't interfere
with anything AWS related. Here's the guides I'd be using:

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204404314/how-can-i-create-an=
-spf-record-for-my-domain

https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/115003098072/how-do-i-add-a-d=
kim-txt-record-to-my-domain

Do you have any feeling on either? If not I'll charge bravely forward in
the hopes it'll help us keep from being blacklisted!

- J

P.S. AFAIK MediaTemple doesn't offer support for DMARC.
