Gustavo,

It looks like we're in good shape; the landlord hasn't said anything,
they've got our check for this month, and nobody in NYC can be evicted
until the end of the year. Unless we hear otherwise I think we can treat
this as a month-to-month situation.

You'd asked in our last call (or the one before that?) about payment for
rent, utilities, etc. Here's the rundown:

ConEd (electricity): $100
National Grid (gas): $20
Allstate (renter's insurance): $16
Time Warner Cable (internet): $65
-----
Total: $201/month

Rent as we're paying it now is $1,125 but we'd only asked you to pay $500
of that. So that's $701/month total. Please transfer it to our bank account
at:

BANK: Capital One
PRIMARY ACCOUNT HOLDER: Joshua W Klein
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 80532857
ROUTING NUMBER: 031176110

Finally, let me know when you're around to talk about a schedule for
getting things packed, when you'd want us to get a storage facility, etc.
We're sending you both all best wishes; let us know if you have any
questions, and thanks again for being such good partners as we've been
navigating these crazy times!

All best,
Josh
