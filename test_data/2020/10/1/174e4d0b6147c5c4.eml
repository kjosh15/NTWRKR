Can I sheepishly add one more record?

_dmarc.josh.is IN TXT v=3DDMARC1; p=3Dnone; rua=3Dmailto:dmarc-reports@josh=
.is

Realized I'd left it off as you're not to supply it until both DKIM and SPF
have been running for 48 hours. :/

Many many thanks!
Josh

P.S. Are you following ML graphics at all these days? I've got a tv show
developer who's very interested in combining deepfakes, GPT-3, and climate
change deniers.
