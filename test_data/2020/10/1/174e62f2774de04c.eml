Hi Betsy,

That works for me. I also received some additional photos from Valerie.

If you could forward Cassandra the pdf I sent to you, she can work on =
the edits and review them with you. Once you are happy with all the =
changes, send the pdf back to me with the markups and I=E2=80=99ll edit =
the original layout.

Let me know if that will work for you and if you have any questions.

My best,
:Michelle
