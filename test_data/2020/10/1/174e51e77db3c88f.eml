>=C2=A0</p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Hi Jay- happy to help. I wish I coul=
d have gotten to you sooner, but let&#39;s see if we can get you fixed up.<=
/p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
First- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap the servo and the Arduino.=
 This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of buil=
ds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very high q=
uality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones.=
 Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can=
 stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p><=
/div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second- Did you make any changes at all to=
 the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div=
><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power supply=
 issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule that in,=
 or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which had =
power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior t=
hat couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;=
t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order you =
described.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">First, a fact about servo operation: When the servo first =
starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the system is un=
derpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, this cur=
rent surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it=
 to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will d=
o is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could explain w=
hy your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Here are three problems I&#39;d=
 like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">1) If you are running your elec=
tronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via USB, yo=
u still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull a=
bout 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enough to run=
 the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div><d=
iv><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">2) Ma=
ke sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Ardui=
no only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around=
 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1=
 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000m=
A which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure ther=
e&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If you are already using a p=
ower supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping p=
ower supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related pr=
oblems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and =
the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and did=
n&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<=
/p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you&#39;re not sure about the power=
 supply rating, you can take a picture of the wall-socket plug- The side wi=
th all of the specifications printed on it, and send that to me to look at.=
