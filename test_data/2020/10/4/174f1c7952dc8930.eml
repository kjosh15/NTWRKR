I'm not familiar enough with GPT-3 to say whether that part would work, 
but the other sounds like what I've heard called "human computation" 
(especially using implicit user feedback to optimize web site layout and 
style parameters).  It will definitely work eventually, but you might 
need a very large number of objective-function evaluations, which in 
this case translates into a large number of study participants.  Of 
course, if you have access to (say) a popular Twitter feed and can 
measure feedback effectively, yeah, I could see that working.

Huh, I had never thought of paying a 7-year-old to give feedback, but if 
you're okay with it, it works for me.  The main things I'd want from him 
are: whenever there is something he doesn't understand, make a note 
where (and ideally what).  This could really be anything, from "why are 
there sleepers on the railway line" to "why doesn't character X do this 
instead?". Most importantly, if there are boring parts I'd like to know 
where they are.

 From an adult reading, I'd also want to know (1) are there any parts 
that you don't think are age-appropriate for an ~8-year-old? (2) do you 
sense any moral message, and if so, what is it? (3) if you didn't 
already know, when would you think it was written?(4) do you get a good 
sense of the characters' personalities, or do some (or all) of them feel 
wooden?  (5) if anything feels awkward or out of place, I'd want to know 
where that is too.

Oh, and of course you'll need the URL: 
https://www.hhhh.org/perseant/prose/susan/susan.epub .

Right?
