Hi Jay- thanks for doing those diagnostics. Another batch of stuff
eliminated. This still leaves a bunch of ideas for troubleshooting. The
most recent video you sent was very helpful, and demonstrates behavior from
the Crowbox that was worse than I thought.

Is it correct that to make this most recent video, you just turned on the
camera, then turned on the Crowbox and did nothing else? All on its own,
the Crowbox just keeps blinking that light and moving the servo?

The LED that is blinking should only blink when you change the training
phase by pressing the little button that is installed on the breadboard.
I'd like for you to disable this button and try running your Crowbox again.
Just unplug the Crowbox from power and pull that button out of the
breadboard. Or, perhaps better, just pull one of this button's jumper wires
out of the breadboard. In your build these wires are blue and green, it
doesn't matter which you unplug, just be sure the conductive end of the
jumper you remove doesn't touch any of the other wires or conductive
components. Then power up your Crowbox again.

As you've seen on YouTube, the correct Crowbox Lid starting sequence should
look like this if you watch/listen to the servo:

-Lid moves from whatever position it may be in to the half-open position
-There's a pause, then lid pulls to fully-open position
-There's a pause, then lid closes in 15 tiny steps (try to count the servo
pulses if your lid is not installed- there should be 15 pulses if this
operation completes)
-Servo becomes still
-NOTE: Depending on which training phase the box is actually in, the lid
may at this point pull to the fully-open position and THEN the servo will
become still.

But the important thing we're looking for is that we get those 15 servo
steps/pulses. This would mean the lid was able to properly close without
being interrupted by whatever is currently tripping your Crowbox over and
over. If we see this normal behavior we can suspect a bad/shorted switch or
perhaps that the switch is improperly installed, or that somehow the switch
in use is pinned-out differently than the switches from the batch all
Crowbox prototypes were built with. All of these are simple to fix.

If you still have problems after this, power down your Crowbox again and
also disconnect one of the breadboard wires belonging to the Perch
Switches. Then power up again to see how it behaves with the Perch Switches
and the Training Phase switch disabled.

After this we're going to have to look at power problems. Either issues
with low-current, or noise in the power supply. Just to get ahead on this
issue, can you send me any specs you have on the servo you installed? A
link to the page where you bought it, or a datasheet would be perfect. I
don't see how the servo could be drawing more than 2 amps and browning out
the system, but I do want to double check that.

I have dealt with two other Crowboxes that behaved erratically and both had
bad power supplies- one person was using a 500mA rated power supply which
isn't enough current, and the other just had a power supply that was rated
at 2A but did not function properly and deliver clean power. I know we've
already tried your friend's adapter (that was 2A as well, right?) so it's
difficult to continue suspecting the actual power adapter in your case, so
I'm a  bit puzzled.

Also, do you have any spare electronics components lying around? A variety
of resistors and capacitors? We may have to try building a very simple
filter for the incoming power if we get desperate.

-Steve

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Jay- thanks for doing those diagnostics. Another batch =
of stuff eliminated. This still leaves a bunch of ideas for troubleshooting=
. The most recent video you sent was very helpful, and demonstrates behavio=
r from the Crowbox that was worse than I thought.<div><br></div><div>Is it =
correct that to make this most recent video, you just turned on the camera,=
 then turned on the Crowbox and did nothing else? All on its own, the Crowb=
ox just keeps blinking that light and moving the servo?</div><div><br></div=
><div>The LED that is blinking should only blink when you change the traini=
ng phase by pressing the little button that is installed on the breadboard.=
 I&#39;d like for you to disable this button and try running your Crowbox a=
gain. Just unplug the Crowbox from power and pull that button out of the br=
eadboard. Or, perhaps better, just pull one of this button&#39;s jumper wir=
es out of the breadboard. In your build these wires are blue and green, it =
doesn&#39;t matter which you unplug, just be sure the conductive end of the=
 jumper you remove doesn&#39;t touch any of the other wires or conductive c=
omponents. Then power up your Crowbox again.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div=
>As you&#39;ve seen on YouTube, the correct Crowbox Lid starting sequence s=
hould look like this if you watch/listen to the servo:</div><div><br></div>=
<div>-Lid moves from whatever position it may be in to the half-open positi=
on</div><div>-There&#39;s a pause, then lid pulls to fully-open position</d=
iv><div>-There&#39;s a pause, then lid closes in 15 tiny steps (try to coun=
t the servo pulses if your lid is not installed- there should be 15 pulses =
if this operation completes)</div><div>-Servo becomes still</div><div>-NOTE=
: Depending on which training phase the box is actually in, the lid may at =
this point pull to the fully-open position and THEN the servo will become s=
till.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But the important thing we&#39;re look=
ing for is that we get those 15 servo steps/pulses. This would mean the lid=
 was able to properly close without being interrupted by whatever is curren=
tly tripping your Crowbox over and over. If we see this normal behavior we =
can suspect a bad/shorted switch or perhaps that the switch is improperly i=
nstalled, or that somehow the switch in use is pinned-out differently than =
the switches from the batch all Crowbox prototypes were built with. All of =
these are simple to fix.</div><div><br></div><div>If you still have problem=
s after this, power down your Crowbox again and also disconnect one of the =
breadboard wires belonging to the Perch Switches. Then power up again to se=
e how it behaves with the Perch Switches and the Training Phase switch disa=
bled.</div><div><br></div><div>After this we&#39;re going to have to look a=
t power problems. Either issues with low-current, or noise in the power sup=
ply. Just to get ahead on this issue, can you send me any specs you have on=
 the servo you installed? A link to the page where you bought it, or a data=
sheet would be perfect. I don&#39;t see how the servo could be drawing more=
 than 2 amps and browning out the system, but I do want to double check tha=
t.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I have dealt with two other Crowboxes that =
behaved erratically and both had bad power supplies- one person was using a=
 500mA rated power supply which isn&#39;t enough current, and the other jus=
t had a power supply that was rated at 2A but did not function properly and=
 deliver clean power. I know we&#39;ve already tried your friend&#39;s adap=
ter (that was 2A as well, right?) so it&#39;s difficult to continue suspect=
ing the actual power adapter in your case, so I&#39;m a=C2=A0 bit puzzled.<=
/div><div><br></div><div>Also, do you have any spare electronics components=
 lying around? A variety of resistors and capacitors? We may have to try bu=
ilding a very simple filter for the incoming power if we get desperate.</di=

y to help. I wish I could have gotten to you sooner, but let&#39;s see if w=
e can get you fixed up.</p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div=
><p class=3D"MsoNormal">First- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap th=
e servo and the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have a=
ffected a couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino b=
oards are of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems =
with some of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to s=
wap the board, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=
=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second- Did you =
make any changes at all to the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"=
MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Right now I suspect =
there&#39;s a power supply issue so we should check a couple of things to s=
ee if we can rule that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I kno=
w of two builds which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhi=
bited odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the =
CrOS software shouldn&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At le=
ast, not in the order you described.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">First, a fact about servo opera=
tion: When the servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of c=
urrent. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the po=
wer supply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino b=
oard and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboot=
s the first thing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-clo=
se it. This could explain why your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><d=
iv><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Here =
are three problems I&#39;d like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><di=
v><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">1) If =
you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connected to =
your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. Th=
e Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection and =
this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts can hap=
pen this way.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p =
class=3D"MsoNormal">2) Make sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Am=
p power supply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo =
can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply=
 that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the =
servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power=
 supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div=
><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If y=
ou are already using a power supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Am=
ps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two=
 power supply-related problems I know of, one person was using a very weak =
500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply=
 that was faulty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you&#39;re =
not sure about the power supply rating, you can take a picture of the wall-=
socket plug- The side with all of the specifications printed on it, and sen=
d that to me to look at.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></d=
