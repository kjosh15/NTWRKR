Thanks, Vitor! I'd heard of GreenBackTaxService, but got a pretty hard sell
from them when I asked up front about what I was likely to experience in
terms of liability. I'll revisit them based on your recommendation.

Separately, I'm in Iceland currently but Amsterdam is one of three places
we're looking at moving in 2021. Do you mind if I ask how you like it
there, what the innovation / tech community is like, and if you think it's
child/family friendly?

Very much obliged!
- J
