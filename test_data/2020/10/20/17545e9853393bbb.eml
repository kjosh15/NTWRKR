Yep, on WhatsApp. Used to be via +1.347-268-0376 but if the app is smart
enough to notice since moved to +354-655-3925.

Situation in Iceland is already stamping down the second wave of Covid,
nobody wears masks and schools are all f2f and in full session, and we're
settled into a lovely farmhouse up in the north. It's not a bad place to
wait out the pandemic, but holy smokes I miss events like SXSW!!

How are you, and what are you working on??
