Heard back from Annalisa that international school are actually much more
flexible than they advertise - she thinks their business model is
collapsing as more flexible / int'l schooling models grow, so we shouldn't
have any trouble. Only one opinion, but a reassuring one! FWIW I would
expect more flexibility as we come out of the pandemic in any case!

xoxo,
