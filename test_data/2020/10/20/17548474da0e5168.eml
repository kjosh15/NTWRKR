No masks and face to face - sounds like Utopia!! here we are on one week in
school and one week at home with plenty of scares along the way=F0=9F=98=A9=
 I'm
guessing numbers are super low in Iceland?

Are you planning to return to the US once the pandemic is under control, or
after the election?=F0=9F=98=8B ... loads of people here genuinely believe =
it will
magically disappear after Nov 3rd=F0=9F=A4=A6=F0=9F=8F=BB=E2=80=8D=E2=99=80=
=EF=B8=8F

Although idyllic, it cannot be easy moving to a new country in the midst of
a pandemic...I keep thinking how crazy I would have gotten if we'd just
moved here, but maybe it was easier to get away from NY right now?

I see your US number on Whatsapp but not your Icelandic number - are you
using both/US number still functional? Guess it doesn't update, unless you
install it with your new number or something like that..can't remember what
I did when I moved to Austin, but remember wanting ALL my old message
threads as a connection to London =F0=9F=98=82
