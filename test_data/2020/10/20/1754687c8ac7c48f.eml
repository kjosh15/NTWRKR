Loved this!!! I'd definitely write it differently (just for style and
brevity), but think you're hitting the nail on the head with a lot of this
content.

One problem I've been chewing over a bunch is how to summarize the platform
in a useful way at a very high level - that "intro video" you were talking
about. I took a shot at it below, and noticed that it totally glosses over
almost all the details that we provide in all our other pitches (how it
works, etc.) That tells me that either a) I'm totally missing the boat on
what people need to understand the platform, or b) we're spending too much
time in the "how to" in our deck and I'm on the right track. Either way has
implications for the content you already developed. Thougths?

All best,
Josh

How's this for a brief video voiceover text?

Every company is different - and every employee within each company is
different.

We all work together, and supposedly towards the same goals.

But all those differences add up, increasing costs, reducing engagement,
and producing inefficiencies and misalignments that drag your company down
over time.

And since WFH became the norm, this problem has only gotten worse!

Fortunately, there's IndigoMetrics.

IndigoMetrics gives your employees a chance to evaluate the peers they work
with most closely, giving valuable feedback in aggregate to help everyone
know where they're doing their best work, and where they need to improve.

At the same time, the platform uses an advanced AI to help frame questions
in a common, emergent language - so employees are all speaking about the
same values in the same way.

Employees end up more aligned with each other, more engaged with their
work, and more confident in where they stand and what they - and their
company are trying to achieve together.

Employers get the chance to support each employee where and how they need
it most, allocating resources only where it really matters and pre-empting
culture problems before they even appear.

IndigoMetrics - the language of your company, by your company.

OR

IndigoMetrics - your companies' values, as your company lives them.
