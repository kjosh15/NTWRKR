Hi Josh,

Glad you enjoyed them! For Talking Green, we asked the host for stories
about money that could open the ep or could add to their banter =E2=80=94 i=
t wasn't
scripted. Let us know if you want any add'l details.

Also, one question for you, the potential co-host we're exploring is in LA
so you guys will be eight hours apart if we choose to move in this
direction. Can you confirm your working hours or if you're comfortable with
having calls a bit later in the evening? Of course we'll be mindful of
scheduling but wanted to know if there's occasional flexibility.

Thanks!
Uyen
