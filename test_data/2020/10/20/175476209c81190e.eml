HI! I had sent you some messages through WhatsAPP. I trust you are all
doing well. I look forward to connecting soon. I am better with speaking
rather than writing long e-mails. so I will respond briefly here as I am
very aligned with what you had shared above. we are on the same page. Yes
we can get things stored that you want to have shipped to you soon.  we can
move on to the "the store now" list and the kids toys and belongings. I
heard you want them soon . so I can make that a priority for the next 10
days. let's have a call.  I can do tomorrow or friday. blessings!
