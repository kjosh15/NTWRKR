Is this the Innovid you mentioned the other day?

https://www.innovid.com/

You'd also said your friend Margr=C3=A9t would be a good connection to the
startup community here in Iceland. Do you mind introducing us?

Finally, I wanted to loop back around on connecting to Bjork about the
latest treatment. What's the best approach here?

Hope you're doing well with quarantine...!!

All best,
Josh
