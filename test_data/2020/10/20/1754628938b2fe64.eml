Thanks for this; I listened to one of each to get a sense for the style. I
particularly liked how you had a strong narrative for every episode but
also enough latitude for the hosts to come across as relaxed and casually
exploring the topic.

One question I had was about how much input they had in terms of content.
For example, in the Talking Green EP I heard each host gave an example of
how they'd managed (or mismanaged) their allowance as a kid. Was this a
stylistic choice in advance, or did this from your collaboration with them?

Looking forward to it,
Josh
