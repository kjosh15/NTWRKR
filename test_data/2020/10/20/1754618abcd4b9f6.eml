All thanks =C3=93lafur! Would def. be good to catch up, time / COVID allowi=
ng.
Such strange times... FWIW, we're out on a farm (Vi=C3=B0ifell) if your tea=
m is
looking for new territory to walk through.

Really really appreciate the insight and recommendations - at some point I
hope to return the favor!! Stay in touch and let us know if we can ever be
of help.

All best wishes to the whole family,
Josh

I can only imagine - it sounds like such a strange transition!!<br>
<br>
Things here are going well; the boys are doing well at their new school and=
 I&#39;m busy negotiating some new contracts. Which leads me to two questio=
ns:<br>
<br>
1. As part of your legal work do you ever broker the sale of Icelandic LLCs=
 as operating instruments? I&#39;ve been working with PWC to figure out how=
 to manage my taxes, and they suggested creating an LLC to accept contract =
income here in Iceland. I was told there
 is a &quot;word of mouth&quot; market for these instruments (as buying one=
 which is no longer being used may be cheaper than creating a new one) and =
was curious if you have any insight.
<br>
<br>
2. Are you and your wife available for a walk sometime? Would be great to c=
atch up and compare notes on the fall in Iceland!<br>
