Josh!

How are you??? From the looks of it you've been staying relatively busy; I
hope you and the family are well and staying safe.

I was just asking Higgins about you the other day and whether he's been in
contact lately. He's been busy fixing up his house he just bought in San
Jose, but we fantasize about hosting a big soiree with all of you close
friends once we're able. Are you still in New York? Let us know if you're
coming out anytime soon; Josh's new place has a guest house!

Let us know how you're doing--I'd love to stay in touch.

All my best,

Chelsea
