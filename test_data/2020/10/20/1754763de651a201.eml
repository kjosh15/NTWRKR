Hey Josh,

Not sure if I was intended to be on the list or not but after apparently
much rumination hello!

I heard you guys have moved to Iceland - I hope that's working out. It does
kind of sound like an amazing out to the whole American/Global thing right
now. I hope Othinn and Hakon are getting on at school, I bet leaving New
York was hard when they must just kinda be building social circles?

How are you and Hulda getting on out there - big changes for all involved
I'm sure. Thinking back it must have been a couple years since we last
spoke. I know you've been in touch with Ani in relative recency but it'd be
good to catch up sometime. Maybe this time around I could actually talk
about stock options with my brief years in the industry!
