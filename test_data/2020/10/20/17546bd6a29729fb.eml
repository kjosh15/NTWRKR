Hello everyone. 

As many of you know, a few of us are building a video chat startup. We?re making an ecosystem for attending music events with friends.

As part of our testing initiative, I need ~10 participants to sing My Way along with Frank Sinatra on Zoom and Google Meet.

If you are available at 2pm EST today for a profoundly weird 15 minute experience and you have access to a browser, a zoom install, a tetherable phone, and wifi, please email me off list.

That is cool, I?m going to try it. 

I?m not a big githubber, the install directions don?t work - probably because I am doing something dumb.

	pip install instagram-scraper

Gives error -
 
	-bash: pip: command not found


Trying the alternate method 

	python setup.py install

Gives error -

Anyone who makes the argument that both sides are the same is simply not a
person to be taken seriously.  That things aren't as progressive as you
want them to be is entirely beside the point.

To extend Yasser's very apt fire metaphor - an arsonist and a firefighter
are not the same even though fire is the medium in which both of them
work.  To argue that Democrats and Republicans are the same is making the
argument that they are, in fact, the same.

Didn't want to get involved here but the posturing and ad hominem attacks
became too much to bear from the sidelines.

Michael and William are right. If you read what William wrote: 'this is
called criticism, not a refusal to vote.'

To improve our situation means to look honestly at it. The fact that one is
not allowed to point out that the DNC is corrupt and that nothing is likely
to ever change under their stewardship without being attacked as some
pompous and wacky armchair theorist is not only strangely oblivious to the
abundance of evidence we've lived through for decades in this country, but
it's mean-spirited gaslighting meant to silence and shame dissenting
opinions, and not at all in keeping with the spirit of critical thinking
and open discourse I would expect from this (or any other academic)
community. Don't worry, we're not letting any big secret out of the bag
here that's going to swing votes to Trump by saying that the DNC sucks. And
it's not just that they're 'not progressive enough' for my liking, it's a
matter of who the organization ultimately serves (hint: it's not you), the
candidates they put forth (and the ones they kneecap), and the policies
they (don't) enact.

We can say that we must remove Trump immediately by voting for a Democrat
(I do) while also acknowledging the sad reality that the Democratic party
(and the two party system) as it stands will never enact true change that
benefits people over its corporate benefactors. Why is that so hard? Why is
that statement so removed from the daily lives people live and have lived
for decades? Why is that not something to 'be taken seriously'? Is it too
upsetting to bear? Do we still not want to admit that it's true? I find the
notion that we can just timewarp back to 'the good old days' of 2000 - 2012
to be the upsetting one. The 'good old days' were disgustingly unjust when
looked at objectively, their horrors were just obscured by a more gentle,
soothing, and respectable veneer. The 'good old days' created the current
ones. We have changed. It's not crazy to want and to demand better.

These acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive! These 'revelations'
don't mean I won't vote, volunteer and donate all day and all night to
Democrats (I have), whether they be moderate swing state challengers or
progressive primary challengers, or that I don't think there's a meaningful
difference between the DNC's bland form of earthkilling corporate status
quo and the madman currently behind the wheel (again, I do). I will do what
I can, tactically, in the short term, to stave off total destruction, but
spare me the righteous indignation when it's audibly postulated (correctly,
in my opinion) that this could just be kicking the can down the road a bit
until we're up against President Tom Cotton, Don Jr., or Tucker Carlson. I
fear we are doomed to repeat this scenario until we get rid of, or
drastically overhaul, the DNC and transform/replace it with an organization
that truly serves the will of its constituents. When is a convenient time
to do that? I don't know. There'll never be one. Scapegoating and
belittling your supposedly like minded peers won't accomplish anything,
though.

Didn't want to get involved here but the posturing and ad hominem attacks became too much to bear from the sidelines.

Michael and William are right. If you read what William wrote: 'this is called criticism, not a refusal to vote.'

To improve our situation means to look honestly at it. The fact that one is not allowed to point out that the DNC is corrupt and that nothing is likely to ever change under their stewardship without being attacked as some pompous and wacky armchair theorist is not only strangely oblivious to the abundance of evidence we've lived through for decades in this country, but it's mean-spirited gaslighting meant to silence and shame dissenting opinions, and not at all in keeping with the spirit of critical thinking and open discourse I would expect from this (or any other academic) community. Don't worry, we're not letting any big secret out of the bag here that's going to swing votes to Trump by saying that the DNC sucks. And it's not just that they're 'not progressive enough' for my liking, it's a matter of who the organization ultimately serves (hint: it's not you), the candidates they put forth (and the ones they kneecap), and the policies they (don't) enact.

We can say that we must remove Trump immediately by voting for a Democrat (I do) while also acknowledging the sad reality that the Democratic party (and the two party system) as it stands will never enact true change that benefits people over its corporate benefactors. Why is that so hard? Why is that statement so removed from the daily lives people live and have lived for decades? Why is that not something to 'be taken seriously'? Is it too upsetting to bear? Do we still not want to admit that it's true? I find the notion that we can just timewarp back to 'the good old days' of 2000 - 2012 to be the upsetting one. The 'good old days' were disgustingly unjust when looked at objectively, their horrors were just obscured by a more gentle, soothing, and respectable veneer. The 'good old days' created the current ones. We have changed. It's not crazy to want and to demand better.

These acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive! These 'revelations' don't mean I won't vote, volunteer and donate all day and all night to Democrats (I have), whether they be moderate swing state challengers or progressive primary challengers, or that I don't think there's a meaningful difference between the DNC's bland form of earthkilling corporate status quo and the madman currently behind the wheel (again, I do). I will do what I can, tactically, in the short term, to stave off total destruction, but spare me the righteous indignation when it's audibly postulated (correctly, in my opinion) that this could just be kicking the can down the road a bit until we're up against President Tom Cotton, Don Jr., or Tucker Carlson. I fear we are doomed to repeat this scenario until we get rid of, or drastically overhaul, the DNC and transform/replace it with an organization that truly serves the will of its constituents. When is a convenient time to do that? I don't know. There'll never be one. Scapegoating and belittling your supposedly like minded peers won't accomplish anything, though.

To extend Yasser's very apt fire metaphor - an arsonist and a firefighter are not the same even though fire is the medium in which both of them work.  To argue that Democrats and Republicans are the same is making the argument that they are, in fact, the same.

Imagine arguing that both sides are the same on an alumni email list of one of the most expensive private universities in the world. Thanks for the TED talk. Now, tell us what we should do about climate change as you fly private to Davos.

Lives are on the line. That?s not an exaggeration. People are risking their lives (and not just due to Covid) to cast a vote, in America, in 2020.

I?m all for a major renovation. We should remove the asbestos and the lead paint (e.g. old white men and dark money), update our plumbing and electrical wiring (e.g. automatic voter registration and secure voting systems), and throw in a new HVAC system while we?re at it (e.g. abolish ICE and secure universal healthcare).

But there is a 5-alarm fire in our building that needs to be addressed first.

This is called criticism, not a refusal to vote.





Criticism is a form of political activity, much like voting, mutual aid, protest, striking, rebellion, and critically, party-building.





Here are some quotes from Seth Ackerman in a 2016 Jacobin article titled ?A Blueprint for a New Party<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.jacobinmag.com_2016_11_bernie-2Dsanders-2Ddemocratic-2Dlabor-2Dparty-2Dackerman&d=DwMFaQ&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=GHjt9cnutYy6wUje-H-DSA&m=G9WufR21r4cQmPfCn26pW2R4DSZOpEQBWTyvLRip_Wc&s=Ey6lJcCUuaspM1p958ZvcMtgOBROXE5iw90l_h1FNLs&e=>?:

One lesson from history is clear: We have to stop approaching our task as if the problems we face were akin to those faced by the organizers of, say, the British Labour Party in 1900 or Canada?s New Democratic Party<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.jacobinmag.com_2016_04_mulcair-2Dndp-2Dleap-2Dmanifesto-2Dnaomi-2Dklein-2Dpipeline_&d=DwMFaQ&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=GHjt9cnutYy6wUje-H-DSA&m=G9WufR21r4cQmPfCn26pW2R4DSZOpEQBWTyvLRip_Wc&s=-y3zd6JTuQlBD9z8gqkb6_OwFXcvJPreTuMC-KASwrg&e=> in 1961. Instead, we need to realize that our situation is more like that facing opposition parties in soft-authoritarian systems, like those of Russia or Singapore. Rather than yet another suicidal frontal assault, we need to mount the electoral equivalent of guerrilla insurgency. In short, we need to think about electoral strategy more creatively.

[?]

Does that mean opting for the strategy championed by most progressive critics of the third-party route ? namely, ?working within the Democratic Party??
No. Or at least, not in the way that phrase is usually meant.

[?]

?Working within the Democratic Party? has been the prevailing model of progressive political action for decades now, and it suffers from a fundamental limitation: it cedes all real agency to professional politicians. The liberal office-seeker becomes the indispensable actor to whom all others, including progressives, must respond.

[?]

In a genuinely democratic party, the organization?s membership, program, and leadership are bound together tightly by a powerful, mutually reinforcing connection. The party?s members are its sovereign power; they come together through a sense of shared interest or principle. Through deliberation, the members establish a program to advance those interests. The party educates the public around the program, and it serves, in effect, as the lodestar by which the party is guided. Finally, the members choose a party leadership ? including electoral candidates ? who are accountable to the membership and bound by the program.

[?]

The ballot line would thus be regarded as a secondary issue. The organization would base its legal right to exist not on the repressive ballot laws, but on the fundamental rights of freedom of association.

[After Citizen?s United, a national political organization could adopt the ?Carey? model<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__bolderadvocacy.org_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_2012_10_The-5FConnection-5FCh5-5Fpaywall.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=GHjt9cnutYy6wUje-H-DSA&m=G9WufR21r4cQmPfCn26pW2R4DSZOpEQBWTyvLRip_Wc&s=wCOS0RNb61tqJ53N0AIslwjHfpq1GhUv_svkr_2ipYY&e=> of campaign finance, validated in 2011 by the Carey v. FEC<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.fec.gov_law_litigation_carey.shtml&d=DwMFaQ&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=GHjt9cnutYy6wUje-H-DSA&m=G9WufR21r4cQmPfCn26pW2R4DSZOpEQBWTyvLRip_Wc&s=lMQWmrH0MIumgViD4ve2Xaf0Y-N3Gv1HKARbjmtu5cI&e=> federal court decision. In this model, the national organization would incorporate as a 501(c)4 social welfare organization, permitting it to endorse candidates and engage in explicit campaigning, while accepting unlimited donations and spending unlimited amounts on political education. (It would also, of course, be free to adopt rigorous self-imposed disclosure rules, as it should.)

People still believe this? After all that?s happened in the past few decades?





Anyway.





And let me repeat myself: Don?t like the two-party system? Too bad! We?re stuck with it as long as long as we have first-past-the-post voting. The major parties will continue to hew towards the center and third parties will continue to sabotage the major party they most agree with (and will continue to be a vector for election tampering, cf. Jill Stein).





Don?t like first-past-the-post voting? Neither do I. Might I suggest learning about and supporting instant-runoff voting? Some regions and states are already experimenting with it.





As far as capitalism vs. socialism. Not sure what to tell you, there. No politician is capable of snapping their fingers and changing our entire economic system. But there is one party that supports getting money out of politics, expanding civil rights, promoting unions, progressive taxation, expanding access to healthcare and education, and making sure we have a strong government capable of standing up to large corporations. As long as we?re stuck with just two viable parties, might I humbly suggest supporting that one.

We legitimize this by acknowledging only the two parties as legitimate via their primaries, conventions, and debates. All it does is lock us into this broken system.





The good guys and the bad guys in WWE all work for the same company (and it?s also not real). Every binary decision we make every election has the same end result (someone from one of the two parties gets to stay or move into office).





Say what you will, but it states not in our constitution that you must be nominated or hold a primary or a convention in order to put forth a candidate for any office.





Stop giving them your money and your eyeballs and maybe things will change. Don?t believe you are on the right side because it?s us vs them not red vs blue.





It will continue to be 100% purple unless we demand change with our choices. Please don?t tell me that I am wasting my vote or helping the other side. FOMO helps keep us locked into binary choices.

In Portland the federal agents just straight up murdered a (white, male) suspect outside his own home, execution-style for being anti-fascist and the President just bragged about it in today?s rally speech.





The Supreme Court just ok?d stopping the most chaotic Census in living memory that will help determine Congressional districts across the country.





Didn?t you see Lindsey Graham today saying that it?s great that Judge Amy is so pro-life as he stood in the Senate and illegality asked for campaign donations?





I think we might be past the point of normality and equalisation. Now it?s a question of how much more broken things become, and what it will look like when the pieces are put back together in some kind of order.

Hi,





I'm an optimist, and sometimes self-described realist. I've found myself happily surprised that kids going to school hasn't yet brought a gigantic wave of corona virus cases... But that's not why i am writing...





Jonathan Swerdloff, with a surprisingly difficult name to spell, brought up the Supreme Court, and I want to float an optimistic theory that you guys can all crush down.





I think the Supreme Court self equalizes. They play roles in their 9 seats and sometimes those roles have to change. With the loss of RGB, and the eventual appointment of Amy, someone on the conservative side will start leaning more liberal. Or judges will do the surprise swing vote or they strike down the cases before they get to court.





Why do I think that? Because Roe VS Wade is supported by a lot more than 50% of the country and I don't think the court wants to move us to move starkly against the wishes of the populace.





Ok, how naive is that?

Nick,

It is admirable of you to come in as the savior of academic discourse. I am not aware of anyone being restricted or prevented from pointing out anything on this list or in this thread. It undermines your message to make that claim and then throw out accusations of gaslighting, shaming, and scapegoating.

Also, thanks for the hint about who the DNC truly serves. Now that I know that, I'll sleep better at night and won't need to worry about children being stolen from their parents at the border any longer. As soon as I convey this to my brown-skinned and muslim friends and family, I'm sure they will all feel a lot safer.

You ask a lot of questions in your next paragraph. I'm not sure why you are so confused. Many, many people (including me) are actively doing all they can to remove Trump while simultaneously recognizing the inconsistencies and failures of the DNC. I think what you (and others) are not realizing or perhaps are unable to see is that there has never been a system that truly serves the people, and that is especially true for people of color, immigrants, and other marginalized groups. And yet, every election, these groups overwhelmingly throw their votes behind Democrats. Is that because they think the DNC is their savior or some perfect political operation? Is it because they don't want to make changes to our government or political structure? Fuck no. It's because the other side has historically wanted to eliminate them. This feeling of life or death is more palpable in this election than ever before in my lifetime.

So, when someone comes at me with "both sides" or "the DNC fucked over Bernie" or "Democrats are beholden to their corporate overlords", while advocating for voting 3rd party or casting a protest vote, and, at the same time, doesn't know if they want to build a new system from scratch or improve the existing one, doesn't know if now is a convenient time or not, and doesn't have any other actionable (or even debatable) plan or proposal or roadmap to put forth for evaluation or discussion, I find that selfish, reckless, and dangerous (now more than ever) and I can't help but look at that person in the same light as anyone else who has sought to further their own cause at the expense of those who are most vulnerable.

Some people have the luxury and privilege of using their vote to rage against the machine. Other people are just trying not to die. If my impassioned expression of this injustice comes off as righteous indignation, I'm cool with that.

Yasser,

I'm sorry that you believe that I am as "selfish, reckless, and dangerous"
as those who "seek to further their own cause at the expense of those who
are most vulnerable". Honestly, that's a pretty extreme and hurtful thing
to say. I don't think it's fair and I know it's not accurate. I humbly ask
you to take that back.

Do you truly believe that I seek to exploit the suffering of others for my
own gain? Because, I, as you fairly point out: a) Don't have an actionable
plan to fix our problems and b) cannot reconcile how to continue to make
short term tactical decisions for our collective continued life-of-death
survival with how to build a more tenable, stable, and positive society in
the future?

If you are "actively doing all [you] can to remove Trump while
simultaneously recognizing the inconsistencies and failures of the DNC"
then I would hope you have more in common with me than not. Speaking of
which, I appreciate your highlighting that some have much more privilege
than others. With that said, this is not a matter of armchair philosophy
for me, and I highly doubt it is for anyone else on this list. This
election has serious consequences for pretty much everyone. My mom is an
elderly cancer survivor who recently lost her partner and lives alone.
Trump's direct repudiation of science and public safety, to say nothing of
his total incompetence have put her life directly at risk. For this reason
and many others, we are angry and scared.

I was not advocating for a protest or a third party vote. As I wrote
before, I donate, volunteer, and will vote for Biden and other Democratic
candidates for Senate. What I was trying to highlight is that a Democratic
presidency is not a panacea, and the historical effect of policies
maintained by the Democrats as well as the Republicans have caused great
pain and suffering and helped create the conditions that helped Trump come
to power. We have to make the opposition party better. To do so we need to
be honest about their failings. It sounds like this is not news to you.
Good! In that case, I apologize for stating the obvious.

Nick

Nick,

This might be a little long, but please read through to the end.

When you charged into the thread claiming that certain posters were "right", that people were " not allowed to point out that the DNC is corrupt" , and that impassioned responses were " mean-spirited gaslighting meant to silence and shame dissenting opinions," those were inflammatory words.

Accusing someone who is attempting to point out the potential danger of looking at this election as anything other than a 5-alarm fire of the same tactics the current administration (and fascist regimes around the world) use to put peoples' lives in danger was wildly inappropriate and just really shitty.

I am not saying you are exploiting the suffering of others because you don't have a plan to reinvent US Politics or because it's hard for you to balance short term decisions with long term sociopolitical goals. What I was trying to get across was that when really good, well-intentioned people advocate for things (directly or indirectly) that end up helping really bad people gain or maintain power, what's the difference between the two groups? They might as well be on the same team.

No one is claiming that a Democratic presidency is a panacea. The failings and shortcomings of the Democratic party are well documented and discussed. We know the history of this country is one of great pain and suffering for many people. No one is being more honest about this and no one knows this pain more intimately than the BIPOC communities who, in addition to bravely bringing attention to the imperfections and the unfairness, are courageously going out to cast votes and influence a system that has historically crushed them. I am currently living in Arlee, Montana on part of the Flathead Indian Reservation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes and I am witnessing firsthand the enormous efforts being put forth just to be able to cast a vote. Only a month ago, after enormous effort, a state law was permanently struck down that restricted ballot collection efforts which are critical to Native American voters living on rural reservations. (More here ( https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-permanently-strikes-down-montana-law-restricts-voting-rights-native-americans ) ).

I believe 1) we should do everything we can right now to make sure we elect people who will significantly reduce the danger these communities face, even if those elected officials are part of a shitty political party and system. 2) We can do this while also continuing to critique our society. My issue is when 2 gets in the way of us accomplishing 1.

I also believe we do have much more in common than not. I do not believe you are a selfish, reckless, or dangerous person. I mean, Barcode Bots could have been reckless if you had gone all-in with QR codes, but thankfully you didn't. In all honesty, I know you are a brilliant and good human and I didn't enter this conversation with the intention of hurting you or anyone. My messages were harsher than they needed to be. I could have made my points in a friendlier fashion and I apologize for any hurt they have caused you (or others).

Ultimately, we are all on the same team here and although this thread was a bit of a bumpy ride, I am thankful that we have this community and outlet. I also appreciate you sharing some intimate details of your family. As someone who lost a parent to cancer after lots of chemo and radiation, I often think about how extra scared and paranoid I would be today during this pandemic and this political situation.

In the immortal words of Dan S not Dan O ?

" Ok everyone please simmer down. Nobody is wrong (except those who claim the ?both sides argument??especially right now). Do your part. Then let?s talk. Please."

I'm sure this has gone around before, but wanted to get any updated
recommendations.

The US (and Eritrea) are the only governments that tax citizens wherever
they make their funds - does anyone have any advice on accountants who can
help figure out what your tax burden is likely to be??

Many thanks!
Josh

I have been using https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/ for the last few
years, since moving to Germany. Their site looks kind of cheesy (IMO,
anyway - i felt deterred at first) and they assign me a new accountant
every year, *but* they have been so nice and fast and flawless, i've
been really happy with them. Can def recommend.

I mostly use my aunt and cousin who are small accountants in the US. If you
aren't making more money than the tax equalisation treaty states (I think
up to about $100K?) then it's easy. I've never used an online service, they
wanted to charge quite a lot for some simple forms. If you make more than
that limit you're going to need a proper accountant and probably take "tax
holidays". And beware of joining a foreign company or starting one
yourself, even a simple freelancing org! The penalties are now outrageous,
thanks to the Orange Clown. It was getting bad under Obama but now you are
screwed unless you are rich.

Before, you could go to the American Embassy (in the UK) and they would
help you directly, they were so nice. At the end of the Obama era they
closed it and under Trump they don't even pretend to care, there are no
services to support American citizens abroad for taxes or with any tax
issues that I or my colleagues can find,

Best
Evan

I just wanted to say that I have a few of the below, er, complications
mentioned below to my name, and i have so far had no problems or owed
the US any money. Greenback charges me about $600 every year to do my
taxes and file a few different forms, which feels like a bargain to me
compared to how much German accounts charge, heh.

( and no, I am not a paid rep of Greenback, just offering my personal
experience :D )

So far, we?ve seen unconventional opinions expressed in this thread labeled "blind, ignorant, or deluded?, those who have expressed criticism of the DNC have been told to "sit down and shut the fuck up? and their views have been belittled as "self-entitled and self- indulgent complaints?.  One must point out injustice when one sees it, right?

We know the history of this country is one of great pain and suffering for many people. No one is being more honest about this and no one knows this pain more intimately than the BIPOC communities who, in addition to bravely bringing attention to the imperfections and the unfairness, are courageously going out to cast votes and influence a system that has historically crushed them. I am currently living in Arlee, Montana on part of the Flathead Indian Reservation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes and I am witnessing firsthand the enormous efforts being put forth just to be able to cast a vote. Only a month ago, after enormous effort, a state law was permanently struck down that restricted ballot collection efforts which are critical to Native American voters living on rural reservations.

Speaking of which, I appreciate your highlighting that some have much more privilege than others. With that said, this is not a matter of armchair philosophy for me, and I highly doubt it is for anyone else on this list. This election has serious consequences for pretty much everyone. My mom is an elderly cancer survivor who recently lost her partner and lives alone. Trump's direct repudiation of science and public safety, to say nothing of his total incompetence have put her life directly at risk. For this reason and many others, we are angry and scared.

What I was trying to highlight is that a Democratic presidency is not a panacea, and the historical effect of policies maintained by the Democrats as well as the Republicans have caused great pain and suffering and helped create the conditions that helped Trump come to power. We have to make the opposition party better. To do so we need to be honest about their failings. It sounds like this is not news to you. Good! In that case, I apologize for stating the obvious.

The fact that one is not allowed to point out that the DNC is corrupt and that nothing is likely to ever change under their stewardship without being attacked as some pompous and wacky armchair theorist is not only strangely oblivious to the abundance of evidence we've lived through for decades in this country, but it's mean-spirited gaslighting meant to silence and shame dissenting opinions, and not at all in keeping with the spirit of critical thinking and open discourse I would expect from this (or any other academic) community. Don't worry, we're not letting any big secret out of the bag here that's going to swing votes to Trump by saying that the DNC sucks. And it's not just that they're 'not progressive enough' for my liking, it's a matter of who the organization ultimately serves (hint: it's not you), the candidates they put forth (and the ones they kneecap), and the policies they (don't) enact.
> 
> We can say that we must remove Trump immediately by voting for a Democrat (I do) while also acknowledging the sad reality that the Democratic party (and the two party system) as it stands will never enact true change that benefits people over its corporate benefactors. Why is that so hard? Why is that statement so removed from the daily lives people live and have lived for decades? Why is that not something to 'be taken seriously'? Is it too upsetting to bear? Do we still not want to admit that it's true? I find the notion that we can just timewarp back to 'the good old days' of 2000 - 2012 to be the upsetting one. The 'good old days' were disgustingly unjust when looked at objectively, their horrors were just obscured by a more gentle, soothing, and respectable veneer. The 'good old days' created the current ones. We have changed. It's not crazy to want and to demand better.
> 
> These acknowledgements are not mutually exclusive! These 'revelations' don't mean I won't vote, volunteer and donate all day and all night to Democrats (I have), whether they be moderate swing state challengers or progressive primary challengers, or that I don't think there's a meaningful difference between the DNC's bland form of earthkilling corporate status quo and the madman currently behind the wheel (again, I do). I will do what I can, tactically, in the short term, to stave off total destruction, but spare me the righteous indignation when it's audibly postulated (correctly, in my opinion) that this could just be kicking the can down the road a bit until we're up against President Tom Cotton, Don Jr., or Tucker Carlson. I fear we are doomed to repeat this scenario until we get rid of, or drastically overhaul, the DNC and transform/replace it with an organization that truly serves the will of its constituents. When is a convenient time to do that? I don't know. There'll never be one. Scapegoating and belittling your supposedly like minded peers won't accomplish anything, though.

Instead, we need to realize that our situation is more like that facing opposition parties in soft-authoritarian systems, like those of Russia or Singapore.

The party educates the public around the program, and it serves, in effect, as the lodestar by which the party is guided. Finally, the members choose a party leadership ? including electoral candidates ? who are accountable to the membership and bound by the program.

Really! I had a long chat with a US accountant about filing for corporate
taxes (a minimal sole proprietorship that collects dividend, a common
freelancer arrangement) outside the US and he advised me just not to do it
because the potential penalties were $50k to start with and the forms were
quite complex and specific. I?ve also been quoted over $3k per year to file
that form from a similar website that my friend uses (expats taxes or
something?). It?s a 40-plus page form and I?ve looked through it, it?s no
picnic. $600 seems amazingly cheap if that?s the form they?re filing, plus
other taxes? If they?re doing a good job (maybe it?s all about bulk and
automation?) then that?s amazing! But if they get it wrong, it?s considered
your fault and the penalties are steep.

Sorry should have looked at their website first... they do indeed do all
these forms, looks like it might add $600-1000 to the cost of your return
depending on which you need. Definitely not bad at all!

Yeah - admittedly, i am completely incapable of doing my own taxes. It
gives me a panic attack to even look at those forms, so i hope they are
doing a correct job, haha! But yeah, so far seems good. I have an LLC in
the US, operate as a sole proprietorship in Germany, work for a German
uni here. Anyways - not to bore everyone with my details, just in case
its helpful for anyone to know my profile && what i pay for an
accountant to do my US taxes, given that.
