I'm sure this has gone around before, but wanted to get any updated
recommendations.

The US (and Eritrea) are the only governments that tax citizens wherever
they make their funds - does anyone have any advice on accountants who can
help figure out what your tax burden is likely to be??

Many thanks!
Josh
