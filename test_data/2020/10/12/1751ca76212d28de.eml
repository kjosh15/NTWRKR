Looks like they jumped the queue straight to productization - very much a
silicon valley approach. Wondering what your thoughts are on how this
changes the pitch to big companies like J&J.

Otherwise how the heck are you? We're moving to a farmhouse down the way,
so facing a bit more isolation (and control over our environment) just as
Iceland sees a spike in cases. Interesting times...

All best wishes,
Josh
