Andrew,

Apologies for the delay in response; this was critical feedback that I'm
still incorporating into the deck. After some consideration this prompted
some direct questions for you:

- Can you think of anyone who could help provide Scientific backing for our
result assertions?
- You asked what you thought this would cost. I have *NO* idea. What would
you ballpark?
- Would you be interested in advising the project? I'm starting to ask some
potential board members to help add some weight to the pitch.

Again, thank you so, so much for your help with this. Please do let me know
if I can do anything to return the favor!

All best,
Josh

I believe they will need to see a proof of concept or demo of the data
visualization to really understand what you're proposing, if it will make a
difference, and how it will translate into improved outcomes and return on
investment. They'll also want to understand who will ultimately pay for the
device and sensors and how that will be accomplished - the business model.
