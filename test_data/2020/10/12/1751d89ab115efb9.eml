Hi Josh,

Hope it's going well in Iceland despite the resurgence there? Bloody French
tourists.
It should lead to a more decisive action for the rest of the winter. A
beautiful time to travel around Iceland, really!

Tax matters in hand?

I made it there for a week with my partner before everything was closed
down - was nice, were even able to see the Northern Lights last eve.

Personally, I've ended up spending loads of time investing in small/medium
cap listed biotech/pharma. Been doing a considerable amount of studying
biology and will expand that. Hopefully, I will also have complete my
accountancy exams for the UK, get to know Oct 22nd.
Jobwise I work at a startup in London focused on
providing coaching/mental health support services within other companies.
Sanctus.io. Pretty cool and timely concept. Hoping to find a job in
biotech/pharma in London though. Difficult in this market but keep looking.

Cheers,
Birgir
