Josh,

Man, I'm really gratified you would think of working with me. Thank you!

It seems to me that this idea (though potentially powerful) needs deeper
research, development, clarity, and specifics before recruiting a team.
Maybe join some groups in Big Data, Gamification of behavioral data, and
Data Visualization to find out what they're learning and how it might make
a case for what you're doing. Also don't know if you've done a deep dive
into the scholarly publications around behavior change and data
representation/gamification. Talk with researchers. It is so important to
have some proof of concept. I'm working on funding a proof-of-concept
myself www.uprightrx.com in the form of mice studies to demonstrate that we
have a functional molecule in real life.

Here is a company using CGM data to help athletes. Phil Southerland is CEO.

www.supersapiens.com

Hope that helps. Let me know when you have more substance and I can provide
more perspective.

Hope you're well over there, too!

Andrew
