Social Dilemma, a new Netflix documentary came out, making many of the argu=
ments that people like me, Sherry Turkle, Cliff Nass, Howard Rheingold, And=
rew Keen, Evgeny Morozov, Astra Taylor, Richard Barbrook, Nick Carr, Mark B=
auerlain, and even Raffi have been making about the impact of social media =
manipulation on our psyche and society for many years. Only in the movie, i=
t&#39;s the tech guys who actually made these platforms who are blowing the=
 whistle on their own previous misdeeds.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#=
39;m getting lots of very supportive email from people who recognize our wo=
rds and metaphors coming out of the mouths of the contrite tech developers =
- but I think it&#39;s important we don&#39;t get possessive about our work=
. This is not about getting credit, but saving our very society.=C2=A0</div=
><div><br></div><div>Our bigger goal should be to try to get some of these =
new tech reformers to divest from their holdings in Facebook, Google, and t=
he other companies aiming at our brainstems. If, like they&#39;re saying, t=
hese companies are as big an existential threat to humanity as climate chan=
ge, then it doesn&#39;t make sense to have tens or hundreds of millions of =
dollars invested in them. It&#39;s like holding stock in cigarette or oil c=
ompanies. We can&#39;t profit off the harm.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>=
I&#39;ve got a monologue about this that opens <a href=3D"https://teamhuman=

</a>, or I have pasted it below.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll wr=
ite again in the next week or so with some upcoming stuff and thoughts abou=
t where we are right now as a society. I don&#39;t think this whole thing h=
as to fall apart, but it could. Accepting that possibility doesn&#39;t have=
 to trigger fear; it can also inspire new resolve.=C2=A0</div><div><br></di=
v><div><br></div><div><b>THIS IS NOT A DRESS</b></div><div><b>How the Right=
 Stole Operation Mindfuck from the Left</b></div><div><br></div><div><div>I=
 still remember when it was the Left who had more fun. It wasn=E2=80=99t ju=
st that they were younger and had better hair, music, and drugs (though all=
 of that certainly helped); it was that the Left was fabulously irreverent.=
 Whether nominating a pig for president, or raining dollar bills on the New=
 York Stock Exchange, these were pranksters and media activists who tweaked=
 their noses at authority and undermined the foundations of consensus socie=
ty.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump and QAnon who =
have taken on that countercultural mantle, using the media available at the=
ir disposal to destabilize fact-based reality and promote conspiracy theori=
es=E2=80=94and to do it all so cheekily that we can=E2=80=99t even tell if =
they actually believe what they=E2=80=99re saying.=C2=A0</div><div><br></di=
v><div>Trump=E2=80=99s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s counterculture a=
t its most effective, when satirists and pranksters began applying some of =
the principles of postmodern art to protest. At its core, postmodernism was=
 about rejecting big, overarching ideologies. If we could deconstruct these=
 top-down narratives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the formerly pas=
sive spectators=E2=80=94could have as much power over the perception of rea=
lity as the authorities broadcasting it. The trick was simply to sow doubt =
by enacting stunts that make people question their own belief systems, reve=
aling accepted truths as arbitrary illusions.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><di=
v>Although Europeans have understood the power of postmodernism since the D=
adaists, in America it was probably counterculture writer Paul Krassner who=
 first weaponized the idea, publishing the first intentionally =E2=80=9Cfak=
e news=E2=80=9D story in his satirical magazine The Realist. Meant as an an=
tidote to the anodyne treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s assassination =
by mainstream books and articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece claimed that whi=
le the president=E2=80=99s body was being transported on Air Force One, Jac=
kie Kennedy walked in Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the exit wound in=
 her husband=E2=80=99s skull. Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known crudity and lu=
st for power, the myth gained traction as both news and metaphor.=C2=A0</di=
v><div><br></div><div>Likewise, we saw Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the =
Yippies declaring in 1967 that they were =E2=80=9Cnow in the business of wh=
olesale disruption and widespread resistance and dislocation of the America=
n society,=E2=80=9D and embark on a project to encircle the Pentagon in ord=
er to levitate it and exorcise it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg explained, =
=E2=80=9CThe Pentagon was symbolically levitated in people=E2=80=99s minds =
in the sense that=E2=80=A6the authority of the Pentagon psychologically was=
 dissolved.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Robert Anton Wilson eve=
ntually claimed all of this activity as part of =E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=
=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the collective countercultural effort to destabilize myth=
 surrounding the American Dream. What made these performative, po-mo protes=
ts work so well was that they were cheeky. While their ultimate intentions =
were of existential importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War, race murder,=
 and economic oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take themselves seriou=
sly at all. This is part of what made them so powerful. How do you fight a =
clown?=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s the orange man pl=
aying the part of the clown, with QAnon as his Yippie minions, pranking the=
 public with fake news and metaphorical stunts that work whether or not the=
y=E2=80=99re taken seriously. In fact, the less serious they seem, the more=
 wiggle room they create=E2=80=94for confusion in the audience, and denial =
by the prankster.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The Republican National Co=
nvention may have been the most blatant celebration of authoritarianism in =
American history, but it was also postmodern theater. An appearance by a co=
uple whose sole qualification for speaking was having waved guns at BLM pro=
testors marching by their home; Melania Trump dressed in a military-themed =
outfit almost identical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania following up the next =
night in a chroma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9Cproject onto me wh=
atever you want=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself responding to accusations that =
it was illegal to use the Rose Garden for a campaign by acknowledging his W=
hite House backdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re here, they=E2=80=99r=
e not.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The progressive Twitterverse=
 responded to each taunt with greater outrage, posting side-by-side compari=
sons of Melania=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=E2=80=99s, scoffing at Trump=
=E2=80=99s use of the White House as a set piece, and dutifully superimposi=
ng anti-Trump imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dress. Triggered, pro=
voked, and destabilized, the Left loses touch with whatever issues it may h=
old dear, drawn instead into a frenzy of speculation about Trump=E2=80=99s =
rhetorical pyrotechnics. =C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Did the Trumps rea=
lly mean to accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn=E2=80=99t matte=
r, as long as we obsess over trying to figure it out. This is the desired e=
ffect=E2=80=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda pranksterism. As Walter L=
ippmann, the founder of the field of public relations, explained back in th=
e 1920s: the object of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpseudo environment=
=E2=80=9D between people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputting pictures in=
to their heads.=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imaginations take care of the res=
t.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Trump has been able to seize the power of=
 all this semiotic play because the left has relinquished it. In part, it=
=E2=80=99s because the Left is now in the position of the top-down broadcas=
ters, and Trump has assumed the mantle of the countercultural rebel. Indeed=
, the Left =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream society accep=
ted=E2=80=94at least the principle=E2=80=94that women, people of color, LGB=
TQ, and every intersectional group deserves equal rights. But this put the =
Left on defense, always on alert for language and imagery that violated its=
 hard-won cultural victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, the=
 artsy cheekiness of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from the streets =
of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia. There, it became the dea=
d serious discipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis o=
f the way language and culture are controlled by those in power. In deconst=
ructing the way the perceptions, labels, and language of a powerful group c=
an be used to limit what seems possible for a less powerful one, they concl=
uded that words can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the heart of tod=
ay=E2=80=99s identity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99s high sensit=
ivity to labels, language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an a=
dversary willing to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=
=E2=80=99s Achilles=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br></div><div>Trump certainly=
 sees it that way, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to deliver a daily do=
se of language and imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN, MSNBC, and my=
 Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad enough, but he=
=E2=80=99s also playing the spoilsport at the very same time, winking and n=
udging at the preposterousness of the game itself, as if to say, You saw a =
military dress on Melania at the RNC? What do you project tonight onto her =
chromakey gown? It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously realizes a=
ny of this at all. Whether the result of strategy or intuition, it works.=
=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Critical theory and the linguistic sensitiv=
ity it engendered doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very well as we att=
empt to fight back against the post-modern antics of Trump and QAnon. Becau=
se now it=E2=80=99s the alt-right using pranksterism to promote fascism, an=
d the formerly cheeky Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it once crea=
ted to destabilize the Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are great tools=
 for revolution, but terrible ones for building consensus or sustainable ci=
vics. They can distract us from the real conditions on the ground, and the =
facts on which our best arguments rest.</div><div><br></div><div>I don=E2=
=80=99t even think this was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. There=E2=80=
=99s more at play here than an academic theory run aground on the shoals of=
 the real world. It=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only really worked i=
n the prior media era, when all we could really do is shout back at the TV =
screen. Interpretation and deconstruction are great for broadcast audiences=
. But we=E2=80=99re not in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=99re pa=
rticipants in a digital media environment. We=E2=80=99re not just hearing a=
nd watching things; our responses become part of the story.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>As computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99v=
e gone from command and control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power i=
s more like a feedback loop, where everything is both the cause and effect =
of everything else. It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the public is =
responding to the President, or if the President is responding to a Tweet, =
because it=E2=80=99s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response to white abuse=
, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black protests, leading to=
 more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer a point of o=
rigin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is responsible. The feedback =
loop spins out into a cycle of plausible deniability. The crazy 17-year-old=
 is on the streets with a rifle, and people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he&=
#39;s a victim, a terrorist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>These feedba=
ck loops are what spun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the current cultur=
e war, only now, fully divorced from conditions on the ground or class cons=
ciousness. It=E2=80=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twitter and cabl=
e TV, in symbolism, framing, and word choice. But there&#39;s an actual way=
 things are, which gets thrown out in the process. These culture wars conce=
de reality itself. No one has any ground for discussion or engagement. And =
this is largely social media&#39;s fault, in that we accept our algorithmic=
ally derived profiles as some measure of who we are.=C2=A0</div><div><br></=
div><div>But when we pull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going on here, we=
 see a whole bunch of poor, disempowered people of every color being progra=
mmed by social media to fight against one another instead of against their =
mutual oppressors. And sure, they can each see how the other side is being =
manipulated=E2=80=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, are being r=
adicalized the same way.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As this all spins o=
ut of control, we find ourselves on the brink of what a full third of Ameri=
cans believe may even become a civil war. People actually shooting each oth=
er in the streets based on crazy ass fake bullshit=E2=80=94and giving more =
ammunition to a President and media that both thrive off this artificial an=
d unnecessary conflict. Chaos and violence work in their favor=E2=80=94that=
=E2=80=99s what the administration says out loud=E2=80=94because then cops =
get more nervous, shoot more Black people, who then protest, who then bring=
 out the Trumpers, who then create more chaos and violence.=C2=A0</div><div=
><br></div><div>But as with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a way to st=
op them.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Just like when a musician hears tha=
t awful screech of feedback on stage, we must pull the microphone away from=
 the speaker, or the speaker away from the microphone. It=E2=80=99s that si=
mple. Break the cycle. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean ignoring the news or our p=
resident=E2=80=99s online antics (though we could all ease up on the doom s=
crolling right now) but maybe engaging with them in a different way. Not po=
ised to reflexively tweet and retweet, but to slow down, pull back and unde=
rstand.=C2=A0</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div></div><b=
