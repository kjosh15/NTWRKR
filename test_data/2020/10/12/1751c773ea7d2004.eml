Yep, still in Iceland - and have met quite a few production companies and
local talent here as a result of helping a friend from LA attempt to get a
movie off the ground (funding issues on their end seem to have stalled it,
though.) Short story is this is a GREAT place to shoot, and I'd be more
than happy to help as I speak the language, have citizenship, and now know
about all the loopholes to jump through for maximum tax breaks, etc. ;)

Do you have any projects in mind that might benefit from a snowy, glorious
arctic backdrop OR high quality soundstage work?
