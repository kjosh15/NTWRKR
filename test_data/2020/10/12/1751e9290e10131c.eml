Update me on Kingdom when you get a chance; the New Zealand Company that
contacted me has a meeting with Netflix next week on a separate topic but
are going to be pitching several ideas. As ever, no idea where you stand on
this but if it=E2=80=99s not moving yet might be worth connecting with them=
. Let me
know!

Also and to that end, would Netflix be a good target for Smart World right
now? I.e., with the idea of aiming at next summer for shooting assuming a
post-pandemic world?
