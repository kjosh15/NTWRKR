Konrad,

Thanks so much! DMARC seems to be working now. Really appreciate your help
with this.

One note; when checking with Google's MX tool it flagged a non-critical
problem in that "there should not be a mail exchanger set up on naked
domain name."

Apparently "the presence of mail server on A record of your domain can lead
to subtle and hard-to-debug problems with mails 'accidentally' missing in
case of DNS problems." They suggest checking this problem with:

telnet your.doma.in 25

To which the response SHOULD be 'Connection refused' vs the "Operation
timed out" which is produced now. I'm assuming this is a negligible issue
but wanted to flag it in case it impacted any of your other domains or
records. The original message is here:

https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/check?domain=3Djosh.is&dkim_sel=
ector=3D

I'll let you know when we start getting feedback on your book - Othinn just
started a new sports program and we're moving to a farm down the road, so
it'll likely be a couple weeks until things settle down. All best to you
and yours in the meanwhile!!

All best,
Josh
