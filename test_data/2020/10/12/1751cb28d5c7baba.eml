This is bonkers!! It's such a fantastic deep dive into the topic, and I
*love* how it stitches together all kinds of different scientific
implications and history for each element. Super, super fun. I know it's
not the right demographic, but the Storybots series for kids keeps coming
to mind - just the energy, excitement, and light touch on many
different aspects of scientific topics. Very cool.

I'd be very curious how you'd rewrite this for Netflix; you mentioned they
were tough to integrate with at first, but thereafter were very supportive.
I'd be curious if they'd be game to dig into this as an opener for a
larger-scoped set of series around fundamental scientific topics. Elements
is ideal as it's so... elemental. But You could expand this to cover core
concepts of any field; physics, or law, or disease... it's essentially
taking a categorical approach that underwrites human history and using it
as a lens to explore how humans have shaped their world.

A bit cart before the horse, I know, but the idea is so catchy, and has so
much scope it's hard to ignore. I'm imagining that the style is going to
set the tone in a big way here.

Let me know if a followup call makes sense - I'm excited to dig into this!

All best,
Josh
