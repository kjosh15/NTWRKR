Wanted to followup to see if there was reason to reconnect. I'm curious to =
hear what you're up to and to see if we can't innovate on something world =
changing together!!

All best,
Josh

Below are a few of my current projects, or just hit me with an =
update on what you're working on. I=E2=80=99m curious to hear how I can =
help!

All best wishes,
Josh

###

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for measuring behavior and beliefs in employees. Super =
useful for newly remote staff, this gives employees clear measures of where=
 and how to improve.

; a project to understand how to use physically =
embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, =
and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

: as ever, I continue to work with senior =
leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / product =
development.

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this =
outreach, there is a whitepaper .
