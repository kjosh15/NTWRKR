Hey!

Good to hear from you and hope you=E2=80=99re surviving the apocalypse =
well=E2=80=A6.So we ended up partnering with Ellen Degeneres=E2=80=99s =
company on The Kingdom. They saw the original tape I did (through an old =
agency contact at ICM), liked the idea, and asked if they could partner =
up on it. We have since became pretty passive partners, with Ellen and =
Co taking the lead, to shop it in the marketplace. There have been some =
conversations apparently with Discovery. I have a check-in call with =
them at the end of the month for a status report.

My hope is that Ellen can work her Ellen magic and do what we =
couldn=E2=80=99t=E2=80=A6.sell this idea. While it likely means we =
won=E2=80=99t have a ton to do with actually producing it - our role =
would just be as Executive Producers -  it would be great to see it =
somehow find its way to the screen. We=E2=80=99ll see=E2=80=A6.

Again hope all is well on your end!

best

DK
