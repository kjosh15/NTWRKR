=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Our bigger goal should be to try to get som=

ogle, and the other companies aiming at our brainstems. If, like they&#39;r=

I&#39;ll write again in the next week or so with some upcoming stuff and th=

w the Right Stole Operation Mindfuck from the Left</b></div><div><br></div>=
<div><div>I still remember when it was the Left who had more fun. It wasn=
=E2=80=99t just that they were younger and had better hair, music, and drug=
s (though all of that certainly helped); it was that the Left was fabulousl=
y irreverent. Whether nominating a pig for president, or raining dollar bil=
ls on the New York Stock Exchange, these were pranksters and media activist=
s who tweaked their noses at authority and undermined the foundations of co=
nsensus society.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump a=
nd QAnon who have taken on that countercultural mantle, using the media ava=
ilable at their disposal to destabilize fact-based reality and promote cons=
piracy theories=E2=80=94and to do it all so cheekily that we can=E2=80=99t =
even tell if they actually believe what they=E2=80=99re saying.=C2=A0</div>=
<div><br></div><div>Trump=E2=80=99s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s cou=
nterculture at its most effective, when satirists and pranksters began appl=
ying some of the principles of postmodern art to protest. At its core, post=
modernism was about rejecting big, overarching ideologies. If we could deco=
nstruct these top-down narratives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the=
 formerly passive spectators=E2=80=94could have as much power over the perc=
eption of reality as the authorities broadcasting it. The trick was simply =
to sow doubt by enacting stunts that make people question their own belief =
systems, revealing accepted truths as arbitrary illusions.=C2=A0</div><div>=
<br></div><div>Although Europeans have understood the power of postmodernis=
m since the Dadaists, in America it was probably counterculture writer Paul=
 Krassner who first weaponized the idea, publishing the first intentionally=
 =E2=80=9Cfake news=E2=80=9D story in his satirical magazine The Realist. M=
eant as an antidote to the anodyne treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s a=
ssassination by mainstream books and articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece cla=
imed that while the president=E2=80=99s body was being transported on Air F=
orce One, Jackie Kennedy walked in Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the =
exit wound in her husband=E2=80=99s skull. Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known c=
rudity and lust for power, the myth gained traction as both news and metaph=
or.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Likewise, we saw Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Ru=
bin, and the Yippies declaring in 1967 that they were =E2=80=9Cnow in the b=
usiness of wholesale disruption and widespread resistance and dislocation o=
f the American society,=E2=80=9D and embark on a project to encircle the Pe=
ntagon in order to levitate it and exorcise it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg=
 explained, =E2=80=9CThe Pentagon was symbolically levitated in people=E2=
=80=99s minds in the sense that=E2=80=A6the authority of the Pentagon psych=
ologically was dissolved.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Robert An=
ton Wilson eventually claimed all of this activity as part of =E2=80=9COper=
ation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the collective countercultural effort to de=
stabilize myth surrounding the American Dream. What made these performative=

te intentions were of existential importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War=
, race murder, and economic oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take the=
mselves seriously at all. This is part of what made them so powerful. How d=
o you fight a clown?=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s the=
 orange man playing the part of the clown, with QAnon as his Yippie minions=
, pranking the public with fake news and metaphorical stunts that work whet=
her or not they=E2=80=99re taken seriously. In fact, the less serious they =
seem, the more wiggle room they create=E2=80=94for confusion in the audienc=
e, and denial by the prankster.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The Republic=
an National Convention may have been the most blatant celebration of author=
itarianism in American history, but it was also postmodern theater. An appe=
arance by a couple whose sole qualification for speaking was having waved g=
uns at BLM protestors marching by their home; Melania Trump dressed in a mi=
litary-themed outfit almost identical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania followin=
g up the next night in a chroma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9Cproj=
ect onto me whatever you want=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself responding to acc=
usations that it was illegal to use the Rose Garden for a campaign by ackno=
wledging his White House backdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re here, =
they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The progressiv=

ffing at Trump=E2=80=99s use of the White House as a set piece, and dutiful=

Triggered, provoked, and destabilized, the Left loses touch with whatever i=
ssues it may hold dear, drawn instead into a frenzy of speculation about Tr=
ump=E2=80=99s rhetorical pyrotechnics. =C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Did =
the Trumps really mean to accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn=
=E2=80=99t matter, as long as we obsess over trying to figure it out. This =
is the desired effect=E2=80=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda prankster=
ism. As Walter Lippmann, the founder of the field of public relations, expl=
ained back in the 1920s: the object of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpse=
udo environment=E2=80=9D between people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputt=
ing pictures into their heads.=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imaginations take =
care of the rest.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Trump has been able to sei=
ze the power of all this semiotic play because the left has relinquished it=
. In part, it=E2=80=99s because the Left is now in the position of the top-=
down broadcasters, and Trump has assumed the mantle of the countercultural =
rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream =
society accepted=E2=80=94at least the principle=E2=80=94that women, people =
of color, LGBTQ, and every intersectional group deserves equal rights. But =
this put the Left on defense, always on alert for language and imagery that=
 violated its hard-won cultural victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>M=
eanwhile, the artsy cheekiness of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from=
 the streets of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia. There, it b=
ecame the dead serious discipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earne=
st analysis of the way language and culture are controlled by those in powe=
r. In deconstructing the way the perceptions, labels, and language of a pow=
erful group can be used to limit what seems possible for a less powerful on=
e, they concluded that words can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the=
 heart of today=E2=80=99s identity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99=
s high sensitivity to labels, language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94whe=
n facing an adversary willing to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have beco=
me the Left=E2=80=99s Achilles=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br></div><div>Trum=
p certainly sees it that way, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to deliver=
 a daily dose of language and imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN, MS=
NBC, and my Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad eno=
ugh, but he=E2=80=99s also playing the spoilsport at the very same time, wi=
nking and nudging at the preposterousness of the game itself, as if to say,=
 You saw a military dress on Melania at the RNC? What do you project tonigh=
t onto her chromakey gown? It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously=
 realizes any of this at all. Whether the result of strategy or intuition, =
it works.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Critical theory and the linguistic=
 sensitivity it engendered doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very well =
as we attempt to fight back against the post-modern antics of Trump and QAn=
on. Because now it=E2=80=99s the alt-right using pranksterism to promote fa=
scism, and the formerly cheeky Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it =
once created to destabilize the Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are gr=
eat tools for revolution, but terrible ones for building consensus or susta=
inable civics. They can distract us from the real conditions on the ground,=
 and the facts on which our best arguments rest.</div><div><br></div><div>I=
 don=E2=80=99t even think this was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. There=
=E2=80=99s more at play here than an academic theory run aground on the sho=
als of the real world. It=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only really wo=
rked in the prior media era, when all we could really do is shout back at t=
he TV screen. Interpretation and deconstruction are great for broadcast aud=
iences. But we=E2=80=99re not in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=
=99re participants in a digital media environment. We=E2=80=99re not just h=
earing and watching things; our responses become part of the story.=C2=A0</=
div><div><br></div><div>As computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=
=E2=80=99ve gone from command and control to cybernetics. Our relationship =
to power is more like a feedback loop, where everything is both the cause a=
nd effect of everything else. It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the =
public is responding to the President, or if the President is responding to=
 a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response to w=
hite abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black protests, =
leading to more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer a =
point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is responsible. The=
 feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible deniability. The crazy 1=
7-year-old is on the streets with a rifle, and people can=E2=80=99t agree w=
hether he&#39;s a victim, a terrorist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>Th=
ese feedback loops are what spun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the curr=
ent culture war, only now, fully divorced from conditions on the ground or =
class consciousness. It=E2=80=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twitte=
r and cable TV, in symbolism, framing, and word choice. But there&#39;s an =
actual way things are, which gets thrown out in the process. These culture =
wars concede reality itself. No one has any ground for discussion or engage=
ment. And this is largely social media&#39;s fault, in that we accept our a=
lgorithmically derived profiles as some measure of who we are.=C2=A0</div><=
div><br></div><div>But when we pull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going o=
n here, we see a whole bunch of poor, disempowered people of every color be=
ing programmed by social media to fight against one another instead of agai=
nst their mutual oppressors. And sure, they can each see how the other side=
 is being manipulated=E2=80=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, a=
re being radicalized the same way.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As this a=
ll spins out of control, we find ourselves on the brink of what a full thir=
d of Americans believe may even become a civil war. People actually shootin=
g each other in the streets based on crazy ass fake bullshit=E2=80=94and gi=
ving more ammunition to a President and media that both thrive off this art=
ificial and unnecessary conflict. Chaos and violence work in their favor=E2=
=80=94that=E2=80=99s what the administration says out loud=E2=80=94because =
then cops get more nervous, shoot more Black people, who then protest, who =
then bring out the Trumpers, who then create more chaos and violence.=C2=A0=
</div><div><br></div><div>But as with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a=
 way to stop them.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Just like when a musician=
 hears that awful screech of feedback on stage, we must pull the microphone=
 away from the speaker, or the speaker away from the microphone. It=E2=80=
=99s that simple. Break the cycle. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean ignoring the n=
ews or our president=E2=80=99s online antics (though we could all ease up o=
n the doom scrolling right now) but maybe engaging with them in a different=
 way. Not poised to reflexively tweet and retweet, but to slow down, pull b=
ack and understand.=C2=A0</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></=
