Cassandra is still editing, but once that's in place I think you and Josh
can give it a thumbs up. I'd really like to run a multivariate testing
campaign for marketing it to parents, if either Valerie or Mary Shay is
interested - that's where you send a different version of the outreach to
two (or more) sets of people and measure the response, and then iterate to
improve your numbers. In this case measured numbers would be open rates,
clickthrough, and how/where/when the associated documents were passed on.
Does that make sense, or is it overkill?

Just keen to learn as much as possible from this campaign so we can launch
new, more effective ones ongoing!

All best,
Josh
