It's been a strange few weeks! We've thought of you all often and are
sending best wishes. How are you all doing, esp. reg. school?? We're moving
to a farm further down the road (V=C3=AD=C3=B0ifell) - do let us know if yo=
u'd like
to go for a walk or a run sometime. Distanced conversation is the coolest
way to hang out in 2020. :)

Separately, given that we're here for the long haul, I'm getting
increasingly interested in working with an Icelandic company so we can
integrate better with the community (og b=C3=A6ta =C3=ADslensku m=C3=ADna!)=
 Who do you
think the coolest companies in Akureyri are right now? Just curious to hear
your inside view; I'm going to build a pitch to Decode, Icelandair, and CCP
but wanted to start even more locally.

All best wishes to the whole family,
Josh

Things here are going well; the boys are doing well at their new school and=
 I&#39;m busy negotiating some new contracts. Which leads me to two questio=
ns:<br>
<br>
1. As part of your legal work do you ever broker the sale of Icelandic LLCs=
 as operating instruments? I&#39;ve been working with PWC to figure out how=
 to manage my taxes, and they suggested creating an LLC to accept contract =
income here in Iceland. I was told there
 is a &quot;word of mouth&quot; market for these instruments (as buying one=
 which is no longer being used may be cheaper than creating a new one) and =
was curious if you have any insight.
<br>
<br>
2. Are you and your wife available for a walk sometime? Would be great to c=
atch up and compare notes on the fall in Iceland!<br>
