Just checking in to see how you feel about the brochure and next steps. I
was going to work with Mary Shay to make sure the PTA was comfortable, but
I believe you'd suggested we conduct parent outreach through Valerie. Where
do you stand now, and are you still ok with the original plan of arming
parents with an introductory document, the brochure, and a short summary of
who/how they should approach at their companies?

Let me know if a brief zoom would be easier. :)

Many thanks for everything you're doing there!!
