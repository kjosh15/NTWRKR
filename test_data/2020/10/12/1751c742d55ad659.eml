Hey Anne,

I'd be curious to hear what happened with your efforts to build a
production company for brands: as I understand it podcasting it only
heating up, and while the project I initially heard from you about didn't
pan out I'm still working with Accenture and seeing ton of unexecuted
potential. Would you be open to a brief call <http://josh.is/scheduling> in
the next few weeks just to compare notes?

All best,
Josh
