Hello again Josh,=C2=A0
Sorry for the delay.=C2=A0 Hectic week.=C2=A0 By coincidence, Jeffrey was i=
n my town for a business meeting in Orange county (he lives in Ojai, I'm in=
 Newport Beach) and we had breakfast together this past week.=C2=A0 I had a=
sked him about you and we reconnected.=C2=A0 That was the first time we had=
 seen each other in several years.=C2=A0 He only remembered that you were "=
techy" and ambitious.=C2=A0
Should I assume from your calendar that 8:00am GMT (1:00am PT) on Thursday =
is the only time available this week?=C2=A0 Thursday appeared to be the onl=
y day open and when clicked, only 8:00 came up.=C2=A0 Based on your previou=
s note, I assumed that was GMT, which is 7 hours later than Pacific time.=
=C2=A0 If so, I'll take a look at next week, just let me know.=C2=A0

If that works, I've got a calendar here - or feel free to suggest a time th=

Really, really wanted to say something clever after that Grandmaster Flash =
comment, but everything sounded like I was either trying to be hip hop, or =
pornography.=C2=A0
So instead, how about you ping me when you get back from CA and we set up a=
 time? As I understand it you've got an interest in the emerging panopticon=
 that is our modern technolopolitical first world society. I've done a lot =
of work setting up and breaking down parts of it and would be curious what =
you think!

Pleasure to meet you! I once got a draw from a grand master, but he was alm=
ost too drunk to walk. Same principle, presumably. Would love to get togeth=
er for some chess or otherwise; we've got a new baby so will probably miss =
the 4th, but am happy to connect after. What times are good for you?
Jeff, thanks for the intro!! Moving you to bcc to spare you the logistics.

Richard,
I was sharing a beer with Josh this week and mentioned to him your new play=
.=C2=A0 As I mentioned to you in the past, Josh has just turned in his manu=
script for a book on Reputation in a digital world.=C2=A0 I am probably not=
 doing it any justice here, but you two should connect on many levels even =
if you just start with the topic at hand.
Josh,
Richard is a dear friend of about 10 years, brilliant writer, philosopher a=
nd terrible chess player (inside joke). =C2=A0
Have fun, you two.
Best,
Jeffrey

Don't know anything about you other than it seems you are a writer as well,=
 but Jeffrey's a fairly reliable source for recommendations.&nbsp; If you'd=
 like to have a conversation in person, let me know.&nbsp; Also, my wife an=
d I will be at the Fourth of July festivities at the Chelsea Piers 'Wichcra=
ft Thursday night - just in case you were planning to be there.&nbsp; As fo=
r chess, I'll bring you up to date on our record when I see you.&nbsp; I'll=
 give you a hint in the meantime.
 &nbsp;Over the course of ten years, one of us has won only one game, and t=
he other guy, the older guy, was drunk when that happened.&nbsp; If you pla=
y, I'm always up for a game. &nbsp;</div><div>
