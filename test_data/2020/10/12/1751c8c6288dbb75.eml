Totally agree about the benefits of a turnkey product. When we looked into
it, however, the only price-effective solutions we found involved
storing inventory and hiring assembly. If anyone has any ideas that could
make this drop-shippable at a reasonable price we're def. all ears, but our
big concern is that doing so would drive pricing into hundreds if not
thousands of dollars.
