A desirable future
At 94, the legendary naturalist David Attenborough has produced a full
length documentary about his life. Just released on Netflix, =E2=80=9CA Lif=
e on Our
Planet=E2=80=9D doubles as his =E2=80=9Cwitness statement=E2=80=9D to our d=
rastic loss of
wilderness. But he combines his harsh, honest critique with an unexpectedly
hopeful vision of =E2=80=9Cre-wilding=E2=80=9D the planet. This is a high t=
ech, highly
urban, but green civilization with vast areas of sea and land protected as
wild zones. I find his =E2=80=9Cre-wilding=E2=80=9D framework more appealin=
g than the
technically similar =E2=80=9Csustainability=E2=80=9D framework, because re-=
wilding suggests
exuberant, open-ended thriving (in nature and tech) rather than just
responsible, constrained sustaining. Attenborough=E2=80=99s last 11 minutes=
 in this
doc is the closest visualization of the future I hope for that I=E2=80=99ve=
 seen. =E2=80=94

Free documentaries
Documentary Mania is a website with hundreds of documentaries you can watch
for free. So far I=E2=80=99ve enjoyed Free Solo, about the first person to =
free
climb Yosemite=E2=80=99s El Capitan Wall, and The Bit Player, a movie about
information theorist Claude Shannon. =E2=80=94 MF
Write on your iPad like paper
Now that iPadOS 14 turns my handwriting into typed text, my Paperlike iPad
Screen Protector ($40, 2-pk) has really paid off. It feels like I am
writing on a smooth pad of paper instead of glass. I bought it back in
June, a couple months into the pandemic, so there were shipping delays, but
well worth the wait. It goes perfectly with the Apple Pencil and I=E2=80=99=
m
finding any excuse to jot down notes or draw. =E2=80=94 CD
Duct tape for skin
When I was growing up we used adhesive tape on bandages. Several
generations of tech later, I now use 3M Transpore Tape ($3.80). Transpore
Tape is like duct tape for skin. It sticks great but does not leave any
sticky residue when removed. Skin pores can breathe, while still being
waterproof. And the tape rips by hand easily, even easier than duct tape.
It=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99ll find in the bag of any doctor, nurse, or E=
MT today. =E2=80=94 KK
Six right livelihood guidelines
No matter your background or beliefs, these wise and compassionate Buddhist
guidelines for living are simply vital. Here are the ones I am trying to
adopt: Consume mindfully =E2=80=94 Eat with awareness and gratitude. Pause =
before
buying and see if breathing is enough. Pay attention to the effects of
media you consume. =E2=80=94 CD
Sheets with pockets
I bought this King size set of bamboo bedsheets for $40 because they have
side pockets to stow a book, Kindle, or phone. I wasn=E2=80=99t expecting t=
hem to
feel so nice! They are much more comfortable than the $200 bamboo sheets we
bought at Bed Bath and Beyond (which didn=E2=80=99t come with pockets). =E2=
=80=94 MF
