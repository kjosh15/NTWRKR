Thanks, Alan! Let me know what comes of your conversation with Alan.

In terms of the CGM project, I'd like to be able to list you as a potential
partner for the next stages of the project. I.e., once we've done the first
round of tests on the different data types we'll need to dive deep into our
findings and create thesis around the most effective areas of design for
behavior change. As per our conversation, that's going to require some deep
expertise around the UX/UI elements as well as the behavior change aspect.
You'd mentioned the latter especially as being of interest.

All of this is hypothetical, of course - my expectation is that the first
round of the study would take at least a year from soup to nuts. Most big
companies (and especially medical ones) just don't move very fast. But I
think it also tells a very good story to have a strong next step suggested,
and E-Line and/or you could certainly fill that role.

Again, this wouldn't be locking you in to anything, but I'd like to be able
to use your name to clarify that we have a strong suggestion to consider
when the time comes. Let me know!

All best,
Josh
