nger and had better hair, music, and drugs (though all of that certainly he=
lped); it was that the Left was fabulously irreverent. Whether nominating a=
 pig for president, or raining dollar bills on the New York Stock Exchange,=
 these were pranksters and media activists who tweaked their noses at autho=
rity and undermined the foundations of consensus society.=C2=A0</div><div><=
br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump and QAnon who have taken on that co=
untercultural mantle, using the media available at their disposal to destab=
ilize fact-based reality and promote conspiracy theories=E2=80=94and to do =
it all so cheekily that we can=E2=80=99t even tell if they actually believe=
 what they=E2=80=99re saying.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Trump=E2=80=99=
s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s counterculture at its most effective,=
 when satirists and pranksters began applying some of the principles of pos=
tmodern art to protest. At its core, postmodernism was about rejecting big,=
 overarching ideologies. If we could deconstruct these top-down narratives,=
 the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the formerly passive spectators=E2=80=
=94could have as much power over the perception of reality as the authoriti=
es broadcasting it. The trick was simply to sow doubt by enacting stunts th=
at make people question their own belief systems, revealing accepted truths=
 as arbitrary illusions.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Although Europeans =
have understood the power of postmodernism since the Dadaists, in America i=
t was probably counterculture writer Paul Krassner who first weaponized the=
 idea, publishing the first intentionally =E2=80=9Cfake news=E2=80=9D story=
 in his satirical magazine The Realist. Meant as an antidote to the anodyne=
 treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s assassination by mainstream books a=
nd articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece claimed that while the president=E2=
=80=99s body was being transported on Air Force One, Jackie Kennedy walked =
in Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the exit wound in her husband=E2=80=
=99s skull. Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known crudity and lust for power, the =
myth gained traction as both news and metaphor.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><=
div>Likewise, we saw Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the Yippies declaring =
in 1967 that they were =E2=80=9Cnow in the business of wholesale disruption=
 and widespread resistance and dislocation of the American society,=E2=80=
=9D and embark on a project to encircle the Pentagon in order to levitate i=
t and exorcise it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg explained, =E2=80=9CThe Pent=
agon was symbolically levitated in people=E2=80=99s minds in the sense that=
=E2=80=A6the authority of the Pentagon psychologically was dissolved.=E2=80=
=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Robert Anton Wilson eventually claimed a=
ll of this activity as part of =E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94the collective countercultural effort to destabilize myth surrounding th=
e American Dream. What made these performative, po-mo protests work so well=
 was that they were cheeky. While their ultimate intentions were of existen=
tial importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War, race murder, and economic o=
ppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take themselves seriously at all. Thi=
s is part of what made them so powerful. How do you fight a clown?=C2=A0</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s the orange man playing the part =
of the clown, with QAnon as his Yippie minions, pranking the public with fa=
ke news and metaphorical stunts that work whether or not they=E2=80=99re ta=
ken seriously. In fact, the less serious they seem, the more wiggle room th=
ey create=E2=80=94for confusion in the audience, and denial by the prankste=
r.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The Republican National Convention may ha=
ve been the most blatant celebration of authoritarianism in American histor=
y, but it was also postmodern theater. An appearance by a couple whose sole=
 qualification for speaking was having waved guns at BLM protestors marchin=
g by their home; Melania Trump dressed in a military-themed outfit almost i=
dentical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania following up the next night in a chro=
ma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9Cproject onto me whatever you want=
=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself responding to accusations that it was illegal =
to use the Rose Garden for a campaign by acknowledging his White House back=
drop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re here, they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D=
=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The progressive Twitterverse responded to e=
ach taunt with greater outrage, posting side-by-side comparisons of Melania=
=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=E2=80=99s, scoffing at Trump=E2=80=99s use =
of the White House as a set piece, and dutifully superimposing anti-Trump i=
magery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dress. Triggered, provoked, and dest=
abilized, the Left loses touch with whatever issues it may hold dear, drawn=
 instead into a frenzy of speculation about Trump=E2=80=99s rhetorical pyro=
technics. =C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Did the Trumps really mean to acc=
omplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter, as long as w=
e obsess over trying to figure it out. This is the desired effect=E2=80=94t=
he mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda pranksterism. As Walter Lippmann, the fo=
under of the field of public relations, explained back in the 1920s: the ob=
ject of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpseudo environment=E2=80=9D betwee=
n people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputting pictures into their heads.=
=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imaginations take care of the rest.=C2=A0</div><=
div><br></div><div>Trump has been able to seize the power of all this semio=
tic play because the left has relinquished it. In part, it=E2=80=99s becaus=
e the Left is now in the position of the top-down broadcasters, and Trump h=
as assumed the mantle of the countercultural rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=80=
=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94at le=
ast the principle=E2=80=94that women, people of color, LGBTQ, and every int=
ersectional group deserves equal rights. But this put the Left on defense, =
always on alert for language and imagery that violated its hard-won cultura=
l victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, the artsy cheekiness=
 of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from the streets of Haight Ashbury=
 to the ivory towers of academia. There, it became the dead serious discipl=
ine known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis of the way languag=
e and culture are controlled by those in power. In deconstructing the way t=
he perceptions, labels, and language of a powerful group can be used to lim=
it what seems possible for a less powerful one, they concluded that words c=
an be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s iden=
tity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99s high sensitivity to labels, =
language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an adversary willing =
to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achilles=
=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br></div><div>Trump certainly sees it that way, =
which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to deliver a daily dose of language and =
imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN, MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in a =
tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad enough, but he=E2=80=99s also pla=
ying the spoilsport at the very same time, winking and nudging at the prepo=
sterousness of the game itself, as if to say, You saw a military dress on M=
elania at the RNC? What do you project tonight onto her chromakey gown? It =
doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously realizes any of this at all. =
Whether the result of strategy or intuition, it works.=C2=A0</div><div><br>=
</div><div>Critical theory and the linguistic sensitivity it engendered doe=
sn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very well as we attempt to fight back ag=
ainst the post-modern antics of Trump and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99s t=
he alt-right using pranksterism to promote fascism, and the formerly cheeky=
 Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it once created to destabilize th=
e Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are great tools for revolution, but =
terrible ones for building consensus or sustainable civics. They can distra=
ct us from the real conditions on the ground, and the facts on which our be=
st arguments rest.</div><div><br></div><div>I don=E2=80=99t even think this=
 was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. There=E2=80=99s more at play here t=
han an academic theory run aground on the shoals of the real world. It=E2=
=80=99s that the approach itself only really worked in the prior media era,=
 when all we could really do is shout back at the TV screen. Interpretation=
 and deconstruction are great for broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re no=
t in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=99re participants in a digita=
l media environment. We=E2=80=99re not just hearing and watching things; ou=
r responses become part of the story.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As com=
puter scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99ve gone from command an=
d control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power is more like a feedback=
 loop, where everything is both the cause and effect of everything else. It=
=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the public is responding to the Pres=
ident, or if the President is responding to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s b=
oth.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response to white abuse, yet white fear is al=
so a triggered response to Black protests, leading to more abuse, and then =
more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as=
 if no one and everyone is responsible. The feedback loop spins out into a =
cycle of plausible deniability. The crazy 17-year-old is on the streets wit=
h a rifle, and people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he&#39;s a victim, a terr=
orist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>These feedback loops are what spun=
 out the Tea Party and Occupy into the current culture war, only now, fully=
 divorced from conditions on the ground or class consciousness. It=E2=80=99=
s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twitter and cable TV, in symbolism, fr=
aming, and word choice. But there&#39;s an actual way things are, which get=
s thrown out in the process. These culture wars concede reality itself. No =
one has any ground for discussion or engagement. And this is largely social=
 media&#39;s fault, in that we accept our algorithmically derived profiles =
as some measure of who we are.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But when we p=
ull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going on here, we see a whole bunch of =
poor, disempowered people of every color being programmed by social media t=
o fight against one another instead of against their mutual oppressors. And=
 sure, they can each see how the other side is being manipulated=E2=80=94bu=
t can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, are being radicalized the same wa=
y.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As this all spins out of control, we find=
 ourselves on the brink of what a full third of Americans believe may even =
become a civil war. People actually shooting each other in the streets base=
d on crazy ass fake bullshit=E2=80=94and giving more ammunition to a Presid=
ent and media that both thrive off this artificial and unnecessary conflict=
. Chaos and violence work in their favor=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what the ad=
ministration says out loud=E2=80=94because then cops get more nervous, shoo=
t more Black people, who then protest, who then bring out the Trumpers, who=
 then create more chaos and violence.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But as=
 with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a way to stop them.=C2=A0</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>Just like when a musician hears that awful screech of fee=
dback on stage, we must pull the microphone away from the speaker, or the s=
peaker away from the microphone. It=E2=80=99s that simple. Break the cycle.=
 That doesn=E2=80=99t mean ignoring the news or our president=E2=80=99s onl=
ine antics (though we could all ease up on the doom scrolling right now) bu=
t maybe engaging with them in a different way. Not poised to reflexively tw=
eet and retweet, but to slow down, pull back and understand.=C2=A0</div></d=
