Hannes,

Birgitta recommended I get in touch with you; I've recently moved to
Iceland, but more saliently hav built a SaaS platform which is generating a
significant amount of data on peer-to-peer reviewed behavior statements
around core corporate values. Since COVID it's become a unique data set of
interaction shifts since going virtual.

Do you have time for a brief call regarding this and/or what it's like to
work in the tech community in Iceland?

All best wishes,
Josh
