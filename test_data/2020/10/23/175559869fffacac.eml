Hey! Just saw the email before this, honestly I thought it was a mass email
so I skipped it. How are you? What took you to Iceland?

As a five second update, I had a baby and am now just realizing teething
baby means no sleep!!! Her name is Ivy and she is quite clever. And yes!
Started a new position. Really weird to be the new girl while in isolation.
Trying to learn all my new people. While socializing the cool affects of
empathy =F0=9F=98=8A

What interesting techy stuff are you solving now?!?

Stay safe this second surge looks annoying! I'm a mom now so I say things
like this. Hehe

Good things,
Adrienne
