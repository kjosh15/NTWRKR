Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/bill%40nostarch.com/25486c0f-ae39-4f54-b331-0e3460c96e33) and I'll make=
 sure not to email you in the future!

A big part of that seems to =

Looking forward to =
