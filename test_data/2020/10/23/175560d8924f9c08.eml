Congratulations!! OMG, this is such huge news; huge huge congrats on having
Ivy. What a wonderful new adventure! And you can sleep later. ;)

My wife's from Iceland and I got citizenship last fall (good timing), so
when we came for a summer break we just decided to stay. NYC in spring of
2020 was freaky enough ... For the time being my kids are enrolled in a
local school and then come home and remote school to NYC; COVID is super
low here so they get to play with friends and socialize and stuff, which is
great.

IRIS looks super interesting, although I can only imagine how it must be
starting with a new role in a solely remote context! Curious how the
socializing of empathy is going; a lot of my time right now is spent on a
platform for measuring engagement and alignment among employees around core
corporate values and we've got all kinds of interesting data on the value
and impact of soft skills (i.e. empathy).

For tech stuff it's mostly the above platform, although I'm also advising a
TV series using AI to engage climate deniers, anti-vaxxers, etc., getting
Cardi B onto a social software platform to drive the vote, and building a
platform for Continuous Glucose Monitoring to defeat diabetes, obesity, and
heart disease. So keeping busy, yeah!

If this annoying second surge gets to you let me know - between a new baby
and a new job I hesitate to suggest you *should*, but I think at least it
would be interesting to catch up and compare notes!

All best wishes, and congrats again!!!
- J

Started a new position. Really weird to be the new girl while in isolation.
Trying to learn all my new people. While socializing the cool affects of
empathy
