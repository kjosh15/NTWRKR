Final Biden-Trump debate was on tonight! I think Trump had been
tranquilized, or at the very least been given a B-blocker...he was
surprisingly calm and not his usual bullying defensive self. Do you miss
your bizarre strange country =F0=9F=98=82

Work situation is all upside down for so many people, no one knows what's
going to happen next, so everyone just seems to have tightened the reigns.
Hopeful, that with a calmer President things can start flowing again, even
if the virus situation is not fully resolved. Your speeches could be
rebooked on Zoom? Would you ever work in an established start up/ company
instead of consulting? What does your start up involve?

Law (shiver) no, it's the medical exams to get my US medical license. I'd
still need to do a residency so tbh, I just don't know if I have the
stamina, but I'm plodding on as don't have any better ideas right now and
will probably end up as one of those cases where mum & son get a residency
at the same hospital =F0=9F=98=B3=F0=9F=98=9D

So I'm going to send you a WhatsApp invite ... I can write on the go,
somehow with email I've got sit down and open my laptop =F0=9F=98=86
