Pinging you one last time: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, =
and to see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and =
the view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call(https://calendly.com/joshua_klein/connect-cal=
l)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest =
Click here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b=
-688c5929/charlotte%40boldstart.vc/d27ddb12-16d0-4d9b-a1a6-5fd69263da7b) =
and I'll make sure not to pester you in the future!

Below are a few of my current projects, or just hit me with an update on =
what you're working on. I=E2=80=99m curious to hear how I can help!

All best wishes,

###

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for =
measuring behavior and beliefs in employees. Super useful for newly remote =
staff, this gives employees clear measures of where and how to improve.

; a project to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce =
the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid=
!)

: as ever, I continue to work with senior leaders and teams on =
technology strategy and new innovation / product development.

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this outreach, there is a =
whitepaper .
