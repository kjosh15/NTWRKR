Mollie,

Here's a customized deck - we kept it short and sweet. Let me know if you
need a business-y looking document full of text instead/also, but with 12
days left on the election we figured quicker is better.

And yep, over here with family. I got Icelandic citizenship last Fall,
finally, which turns out to have been really, really good timing. Now we're
on a farm with its own water supply, power supply (hydro), wood burning
stove and a barn full of wood, and most importantly fiber optic internet
(so super, super fast). It's a regular armageddon retreat over here! Where
are you at and how are you doing?!?

All best wishes,
Josh
