*TL;DR:* We moved homes this last week, so no big updates - just three
requests:


   1. The world of "consulting" is in contraction. Given my experience
   <https://josh.is> with tech innovation/strategy transformation what do
   you recommend for finding cool projects to work 1/2 time on?

   2. IndigoMetrics is looking for strategic partners (and potential
   acquirers). Who do you know in the Big Data / Human Capital / HR Services
   space that might be a candidate?

   3. The CGM Project still needs introductions to big healthcare firms
   with an interest in Diabetes/Heart Disease/Obesity or Medical Devices. Do
   you know anyone?


As ever, please let me know if I can help you with any of your own ventures!

All best wishes from sunny Iceland,
Josh


P.S. Bonus question; depending on the US presidential election we're
considering a 2021 move to Berlin, Amsterdam, or Portugal (bc taxes!) Which
would you choose if you had a young family?
