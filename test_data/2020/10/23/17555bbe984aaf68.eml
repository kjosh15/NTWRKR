Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/bking%40royalfp.com/334050ec-171b-4dd2-bae4-3f5e7f77bf20) and I'll make=
 sure not to email you in the future!

get around that by connecting with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my=

Looking forward to reconnecting,
