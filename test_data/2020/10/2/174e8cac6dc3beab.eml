Lucas and Polina, can you coordinate with Sonali (cc'd) directly about
coming in before your flight to spend a little time with the cats? She's
taking them to the vet on Monday and should have all the paperwork, etc.
ready when you arrive. As ever, let us know what else we can do to help.

Once again, thanks everyone for helping make this possible. Coordinating
the move of our pets from 2733 miles away is a feat we just couldn't have
done without you!!

Thankfully,
Josh
