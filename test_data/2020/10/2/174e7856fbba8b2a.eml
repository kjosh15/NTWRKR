Sure, no problem.

Unfortunately I haven't been following ML graphics closely, though from 
what I hear we're in for interesting times---not so much from 
breakthroughs in the CS part of things as that we just have *so much 
processing power* now.  One of these days someone is going to build 
Skynet out of a botnet.

By the way, how old are your sons now?  I have a children's novel that 
could use some feedback from an ~8-year-old.  I expect you'd want to 
read it first, of course, and your feedback would also be invaluable, 
though my questions for you would be pretty different from my questions 
for them.

Thanks,

-Konrad

            </div>
            <div>FWIW I've been running a weekly online D&amp;D session
              for some kids from our Covid-pod back in NYC, which has
              been a way to give back to the parents who are highly
              appreciative of the time. At some point, in a far off
              distant future, I can totally see us adults resuming such
              ventures in that fantastical commodity of "free time." My
              7 year old is already showing signs of wanting me to have
              more of it, or at least less of me, so I know it's in the
              offing.</div>
            <div><br>
            </div>
            <div>Glad you're well, and thanks for the help - if the mood
              strikes I'm very curious to hear more about what you're
              seeing over there! And of course if I can do anything to
              help please let me know.</div>

                <p><tt>Hey Josh,</tt></p>
                <p><tt>Sorry, I did get this email and I even already
                    made the DNS changes, it just takes longer to
                    compose a meaningful email (the curse of being an
                    introvert).  AXFR shouldn't be a problem for small
                    domains, though there might be an issue with a slave
                    relying on AXFR.  I'll take a look at it.</tt></p>
                <p><tt>I would like to catch up some time, but I don't
                    know when :/ with a ~1-year-old and remote
                    kindergarten it's nearly impossible to do anything
                    synchronous (some time exists, it's just very
                    fragmented).</tt></p>
                <p><tt>The US is crazy these days.  I live across the
                    river from a federal courthouse where a small number
                    of people gather every night to pound on the walls
                    with crow bars, as if they can take down the
                    government one brick at a time; and depending on
                    what news channel you watch, this is either glossed
                    over as "continuing protests" in an article about
                    something else, or reported as "the city of Portland
                    has been roiled by violent rioting for six months". 
                    If you read a Facebook feed that contains both fans
                    of the far left and the far right, you'll have a
                    pretty good idea, not of what's really happening,
                    but of what everyone is seeing.  I had better stop
                    writing about this, it is super frustrating.</tt></p>
                <p><tt>I wouldn't normally think to write about the
                    weather, but a week or two ago wildfires in central
                    Oregon and central Washington brought us smoky air
                    and an AQI of 500 (100 is considered the healthy
                    limit).  You could see only about two blocks, and
                    every once in a while a thicker cloud would blow
                    past.  Then we got rain and favorable wind, and the
                    AQI dropped to single digits.</tt></p>
                <p><tt>I have to imagine that Iceland is spared most of
                    this sort of thing :) how is it living there?  How
                    are the kids adapting to living in Iceland after
                    NYC?  (When did you move, anyway?)</tt></p>
                <p><tt>Take care,</tt></p>

                    Also note that AXFR is enabled, which some say is a
                    security risk. Is there a way I can edit the DNS
                    zone file directly? If not, can you add these
