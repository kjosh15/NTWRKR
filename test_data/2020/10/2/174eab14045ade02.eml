Hulda,

Had a good conversation with Gustavo. They're settling in nicely and should
know if they want to stay past Dec. within the next month. One option we
have is to send notice Nov 31st and let them know Gustavo is interested and
let them negotiate from there. A few issues came up we need to give him
feedback on:

- Kids toys

Gustavo thought it would be fabulous to take a picture of the kids stuff
Etukai was interested in. If our boys are ok with it he can continue
playing with it and Gustavo can pack up and send everything else. That ok
with you?

- Harvard books

Gustavo is fine with packing up the books for Devon. We can send them
whenever - I'd suggest in time for XMas!

- General packing

Gustavo is happy to pack things whenever we need, but pointed out that we
don't need to pay for storage until December. I'd rather have things packed
up earlier rather than later; what do you think about asking to have our
"stuff to be stored" list done by end of October so we can choose to have
anything sent if we need it in Vidifell? Then he can pack everything else
and put it all together in storage in Dec. What do you think?

- Oils and suppliments

Gustavo pointed out that he'd be buying these anyway and offered to pay us
for them as he uses them. What are your thoughts? There's a fair bit of
sunk cost we could recover, TBH.

- Kids art supplies

Gustavo's son found a glow mask and some art stuff that's not been opened
yet that he'd like to play with. If he takes a picture can we quote prices
for them?

- The kids allowance jars

Gustavo is going to tell us the amount in each and just include it in the
rent transfer

- Box of stuff to ship to us

It's 52lbs. Do we want to ship it now or wait until the kids' stuff is
packed and ship it with? Also, anything else from the kitchen we might
want/need?

xoxo!
Josh
