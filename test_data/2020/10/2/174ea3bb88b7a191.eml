Just spoke to a Veteran who worked with Best Buy - he came up with a format
for following up with leaders inside an org and prompting them to check in
with their direct reports.

In talking with him I realized that one thing we could do to create another
feedback loop - or a "service" - would be two things:

a) Give weekly prompts to leaders about things to *compliment* their direct
reports about. This could alternate between things they're doing badly and
things they're doing better.

b) Share the scores for GROUPS and how they're changing week to week.

The idea is to do two things: 1. make leaders accountable for their direct
reports, and therefore to take responsibility for them, and 2. to enable
them to create *positive change *in them.

This is, apparently, the secret sauce to how the army works. They're
largely abusive, but have strong ownership/responsibility up the chain of
command in a way that causes massive loyalty and individual desire to
improve.

Is there a there there?
