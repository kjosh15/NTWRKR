Thanks!

And +1 on the processing power. The project I'm proposing uses GPT-3 to
produce variants of text to give to climate change deniers using a
multivariate feedback loop to isolate the best responses to ultimately
change their mind. I'd like to pair that with the same strategy for voice
pitch, speed, accent, etc. as well as deepfaking avatars to deliver the
arguments in order to produce the most effective person, voice, and message
to engage them.

Of course, this is essentially "bot-ifying" a variety of technologies to
leverage human being's vulnerability in responding most emotionally and
non-rationally to other human beings. By doing this as part of a TV show
I'm hopeful that we can use the uncanny valley to render the bot into the
"other" against which currently oppositional groups (climate change
believers vs deniers, left vs right, blue vs red, etc.) see themselves as
unified. Highlighting the arguments which bring both sides closer together
provides a narrative anyone can use to engage.

That's the high-minded ideal behind it, anyway. How realistic / unrealistic
do you think it is operationally?

As for your book, my oldest is now 7 but (humble brag) he's reading several
grades ahead. He's also completely fixated on learning how to "earn."
(Probably a side effect of all the online learning platforms his school has
subjected him to which gamify the learning process.) If you're ok with it
I'd love to hire him to read your book and provide feedback. Do you have a
set of questions / feedback you'd like answered after reading it?

Also, Trump apparently has Covid. I still can't get over the irony.

Glad you're doing well,
Josh

                    I need to make some additions to <a href=3D"http://josh=

                    Also note that AXFR is enabled, which some say is a
                    security risk. Is there a way I can edit the DNS
                    zone file directly? If not, can you add these
