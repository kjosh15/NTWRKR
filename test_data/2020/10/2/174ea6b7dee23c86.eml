Apologies, Jeffrey Zurofsky introduced us and we exchanged a handful of
emails about chess and panopticons, but did NOT actually work on anything
together. I'd filtered all my past correspondence based on a number of
exchanges and this confounded me.

That said, we never did get together in NYC; want to do a virtualized
equivalent?

best wishes,
Josh
