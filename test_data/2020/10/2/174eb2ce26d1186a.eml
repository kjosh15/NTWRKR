Hello again, one other thing to verify, please:

On the following page, where the CrOS software for Arduino can be
downloaded:

http://thecrowbox.com/wiki/doku.php?id=3Dkit:cros_software

Are you certain that you downloaded v0.99c (October 2018) release? Labeled
"Current CrOS Software Release"? Because there's an older version available
there which has undergone far less testing and could have bugs. This is the
last of the somewhat obvious sources of trouble and is definitely worth
double-checking.

-Steve

p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">F=
irst- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap the servo and the Arduino. =
This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of build=
s that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very high qu=
ality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones. =
Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can =
stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></=
div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second- Did you make any changes at all to =
the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div>=
<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power supply =
issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, =
or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which had p=
ower supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior th=
at couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t=
 really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order you d=
escribed.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p clas=
s=3D"MsoNormal">First, a fact about servo operation: When the servo first s=
tarts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the system is und=
erpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, this curr=
ent surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it =
to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do=
 is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could explain wh=
y your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Here are three problems I&#39;d=
 like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">1) If you are running your elec=
tronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via USB, yo=
u still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull a=
bout 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enough to run=
 the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div><d=
iv><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">2) Ma=
ke sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Ardui=
no only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around=
 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1=
 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000m=
A which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure ther=
e&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If you are already using a p=
ower supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping p=
ower supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related pr=
oblems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and =
the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and did=
n&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<=
/p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you&#39;re not sure about the power=
 supply rating, you can take a picture of the wall-socket plug- The side wi=
th all of the specifications printed on it, and send that to me to look at.=
