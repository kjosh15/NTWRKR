Yes, all well with us. Robin is doing his yoga every day ( he has a zoom
class above me as I write ) and is doing lots of drawings now, as a break
from painting He has been working in the garden too, and listening to a lot
of the Great Courses from the States. They are truly excellent Do you know
them? I am in touch with a lot of people on zoom, and able to get out to
the shops when I need to , as they are well organised here and people are
sensible. There is a special time for oldies from 8-9 in the morning. We
have had great weather this summer, though it is very wet at presnet, and
an intended walk with a friend and her dogs has not happened as it is
pouring. We continue happy and content, though aware that a lot of people
are having a very hard time, especially financially. Still all things pass,
and by this time next year we should have a vaccine or two, and some test
and trace. I expect it is all under control in Iceland. Such a sensible
people!
