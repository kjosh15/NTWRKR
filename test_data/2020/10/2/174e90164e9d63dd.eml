We have $12k in cash now (assuming we close the business account)
We're about to get $20k from the estate (after taxes)
We'll make $3k total in the next three quarters from W50
----
: $35k between now and end of June with no other income.

We're spending ~$6k/month including NYC costs.
Fidifell would be an additional $1k/month
Nov-May is 7 months
----
: $49k in costs from now to May

That's a $14k shortfall between now and May with no other income if we move
to Vidifell. We may be able to recover some money from the tax fund
depending on how we file (i.e., if we don't make any further income we may
not owe the $$ in the tax fund now), which could help in April.

Let's talk this through further f2f, but wanted to at least run the numbers=
!

xoxo,
Josh
