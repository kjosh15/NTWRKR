Hi Josh,

No worries. I=E2=80=99ve also been just snowed under here with little =
sleep. In fact, thanks for your AI email.=20

I=E2=80=99m flying to the US tomorrow and will have a read over it, with =
ample time for a thoughtful reply.

Looking forward to catching up on the ideas you sent!

Matt
