Hi Jay. I've looked over the images and nothing jumps out at me. Doesn't
mean we're done troubleshooting, only that the problem is not immediately
obvious.

By the way, congratulations on an extremely clean build- your Crowbox looks
great.

So, here's where I'd like to start. In your video, around the four second
mark, the LED on the left side of the Arduino (left side in this particular
video) flashes three times. This looks to me like the indication that
Crowbox provides when it powers up- three flashes to let you know the box
is in Phase Three. I'm pretty sure this means something is resetting your
Arduino and the whole system starts over, which is why the lid enters the
startup pattern of pulling to half-way, then full-open, then steps to close
and you never see the 20 second feeding period where the lid is supposed to
remain open. To verify this, can you tell me whether or not this blinking
LED pattern is the exact pattern you see when you power up for the very
first time?

Also, do you have strange behavior in Phase Two as well? I recall that
someone had strange behavior when their lid switches were engaged and I
don't recall if this was your box or someone else's.

If I were to modify the CrOS source code and send it to you, are you
comfortable loading that onto your Arduino? I would build in some
diagnostics and you could always flash back to the official CrOS software
once we're done with our troubleshooting.

-Steve

could have gotten to you sooner, but let&#39;s see if we can get you fixed =
up.</p><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorm=
al">First- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap the servo and the Ardu=
ino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of =
builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very hi=
gh quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clo=
nes. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we=
 can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<=
/p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second- Did you make any changes at al=
l to the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p><=
/div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power su=
pply issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule that=
 in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which =
had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavi=
or that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&=
#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order =
you described.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p=
 class=3D"MsoNormal">First, a fact about servo operation: When the servo fi=
rst starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the system i=
s underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, this=
 current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes caus=
e it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it wi=
ll do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could expla=
in why your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorma=
l">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Here are three problems I&#3=
9;d like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal=
">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">1) If you are running your el=
ectronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your computer via USB, =
you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino can only pull=
 about 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is not enough to r=
un the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this way.</p></div>=
<div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">2) =
Make sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Ard=
uino only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up arou=
nd 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under=
 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 100=
0mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure th=
ere&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"=
>=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If you are already using a =
power supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping =
power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related p=
roblems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and=
 the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and di=
dn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0=
</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you&#39;re not sure about the powe=
r supply rating, you can take a picture of the wall-socket plug- The side w=
