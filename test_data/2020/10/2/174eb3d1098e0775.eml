Hi Jay. I'm bombing you one more time but I just noticed something watching
your video.

The coin that is manually deposited in your video goes through the chute,
into the machine, hits the coin sensor, then stops. It looks to me like it
came to rest parked on the coin sensor when the intended behavior is for
the coin to roll right on through and end up on the floor of the Crowbox.
Did this coin stop because there are some wires in the way due to the sled
being pulled out, or does the coin always stop on your coin sensor?

It's possible for this to be completely unrelated to your problems but I'd
like to know for sure. So, do all of your deposited coins stop on the
sensor?

If they DO, could you please perform a test for me? Fire up your Crowbox in
Phase Three (as you have it in the video). Hold a coin in your fingers and
reach in through the side and quickly brush the coin against the two copper
surfaces of the coin sensor to trigger the lid. Try to make this contact as
brief as possible. Let me know if the Crowbox lid behaves any differently
if triggered in this way.

My apologies for splitting up my questions over three emails. But the
questions I ask in each one are important so please be sure to go through
them.

Thanks!

-Steve

ass=3D"MsoNormal">First- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap the serv=
o and the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affecte=
d a couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards =
are of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems with s=
ome of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap th=
e board, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoN=
ormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second- Did you make any=
 changes at all to the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNorma=
l">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Right now I suspect there&#3=
9;s a power supply issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we=
 can rule that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two=
 builds which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited od=
d servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS sof=
tware shouldn&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not=
 in the order you described.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p=
></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">First, a fact about servo operation: Whe=
n the servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. I=
f the system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power suppl=
y itself, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and =
sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the fir=
st thing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. Th=
is could explain why your lid behaves the way it does.</p></div><div><p cla=
ss=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">Here are three=
 problems I&#39;d like you to help me rule in or out:</p></div><div><p clas=
s=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">1) If you are r=
unning your electronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your comp=
uter via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduino=
 can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is n=
ot enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this =
way.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"=
MsoNormal">2) Make sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power s=
upply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull =
spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39=
;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can=
 pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply t=
o make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=
=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If you are al=
ready using a power supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe=
 try swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power su=
pply-related problems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA pow=
er supply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was=
 faulty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"Mso=
Normal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">If you&#39;re not sure =
about the power supply rating, you can take a picture of the wall-socket pl=

ner on the Crowbox project. I did much of the hardware design and I designe=

I moved my family across the country late last year and then again this yea=
r, so I&#39;ve been sort of unplugged from the project for a while. Josh ha=
s been asking me to help troubleshoot your problem and I&#39;m now finally =
in a position to spend some time working with you to get these problems iro=
ned out.=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:4.=

">Here&#39;s the one part that will be annoying for you, because I know you=
&#39;ve already done this- Josh sends me a lot of support requests and I de=
al with as many as I can. But this means I don&#39;t know exactly what your=
 situation is. So if you could explain your problem and/or point me to some=
 existing posts in the Crowbox group so that I can catch up and devise a tr=
oubleshooting strategy, that would be very helpful. If I recall correctly, =
you have a problem we haven&#39;t seen before so our off-the-shelf solution=
s won&#39;t help you.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-=
