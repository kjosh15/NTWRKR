I also really enjoyed the time - thank you - I'm glad to hear that
companies are focused on how to transform leaders into caring relationships=
.
it seems that it's something they foundationally understand, but the
experience and awareness seems to fail to make the transition to the 'rank
and file' folks.

I sent the email introduction to Bill Hoffman, he usually responds best to
email - but let me know if you don't hear anything within the next few days=
.

Also, I sent you a linkedin Invite so I can share my network with you.
Thanks!
Alan
