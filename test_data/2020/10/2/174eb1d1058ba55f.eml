Hello
You both know a fellow friend, Marilyn Williams, so you already have a lot
in common in that you are both cool people who live with heart and soul.  :)

But I'm delighted to make this connection for another reason, you both
share some similar passions for metrics/data and helping people improve.

Bill
Josh and I talked today, he's working on some very cool initiatives that
corporations are dealing with regarding Covid and distance relationships,
in that it's shaking loose relationship gaps between managers/leaders and
their employees.  He's working on effective methods to help correct the
behavior and experiences of highly supportive teams. I told him about your
military background and your vast experience with metrics and measures
including your corporate experience, working at Gallup, and your current
initiative for helping companies get better metrics and measures. I know
you'll find the conversation engaging and I'm sure you'll have insights to
share that will help.

Josh
Bill is a fantastic leader, and that's not just what his friends and
employees say about him, I've never worked for him and I can tell he's a
great leader. (Marilyn also says he's great! :) ) I was introduced to him
for networking at USBank regarding job search and he graciously gave of his
precious time and he also fully listened and completely engaged with the
conversation.  Bill is currently working on an initiative to help companies
form the right metrics in order to get the right, deep insights into the
right actions to take.

I can't wait to hear what comes out of your conversation..
