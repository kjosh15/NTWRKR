Thanks all!! Apologies for going quiet; I'd make excuses but it's a
freaking pandemic, we all know what's going on. :)

In any case the brochure looks awesome! Please keep me in the loop on the
edits; once we've got things finalized I'm happy to work with Mary Shay to
set up a distribution to parents asking for their help.

All best,
- J
