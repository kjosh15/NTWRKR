Sounds like a plan! It's been pretty amazing suddenly moving to the
countryside in Iceland. The kids are adapting extremely well and we're
treating it all like a big unexpected sabbatical - we'd always wanted to
spend a year over here, and now we've gotten our wish!

I trust you and Robin are doing well? How are things with you as you've
settled into our new pandemic lives?

xoxo,
Josh
