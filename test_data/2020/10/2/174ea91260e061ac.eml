Portable power. The demand for this seems huge and we did limited prelimina=

ed five banks and only the VOLTAIC brand properly worked on low-current dev=
ices without shutting itself off. The nominal use-case these devices are de=
signed for means that 95% of them have auto-shutoff functions which are lar=
gely unlabeled. That said, while Voltaic power banks are a little expensive=
 they&#39;re less expensive than most in-line GFCI switches for extension c=
ords and so could be a good tradeoff for many people. Is anyone out there a=

re skimming the above DON&#39;T JUST BUY a cheap 30,000mAh power bank from =
Amazon and expect it to work! The only vendor we found that produced a work=
able power bank that didn&#39;t auto-shutoff was Voltaic, and that was some=
 time ago. Updated research is needed.<br></div><div hspace=3D"streak-pt-ma=
