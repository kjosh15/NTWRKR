Matt,

Apologies for going dark; our apartment in NYC suddenly fell under threat
of eviction and I had a big shake-up with a pharmaceutical firm that I was
about to sign a contract with. Everything is ok now, but it cost a lot of
cycles. Again, my apologies.

"A late-night program without the scorn and using repetitive, data-driven
elements to ease tension between Americans" sounds AMAZING. I'm really
curious to push this idea further, but you had me with this line alone.

I love the idea of using AI to help both sides engage with each other. I
don't suggest we try to convert the other, as I expect that would offend
both, but if we position it as using AI to help each side engage with and
understand the other - especially if it's about highly contentious topics -
there's a very real power there. After all, this is the extremist element
Facebook, Twitter, etc. have all exploited to our planet's detriment.

One of the ideas here that I keep coming back to is that Americans
particularly are seeing just how divided their country is, and that at a
certain level there is a desire for unity. If we can give voice to that -
if we can have each episode close with two people who were diametrically
opposed demonstrating how they connected over something which previously
made them act hatefully towards each other - then we're giving people hope.

More than that, we're giving Americans a roadmap for healing. The US has
always been strong *because* of its core values, and those values include
diversity. We just need to be shown how we are strong in embracing that.
Having an AI spell out and guide us to finding that conversation - that
"OK, I disagree but can still respect you" baseline value - could be
enormously powerful.

A few notes on format:

- If we could have two of those our AI had the conversations with here to
the studio to reread their exchanges on air always featuring a
reconciliation or emotionally powerful reckoning that would be even better,
no?

- Not sure if having an expert wouldn't cause more divisiveness. Usually
experts have a strong opinion. Or am I missing the gist here?

- I love the idea of halting the show for people to vote about whether
someone changes their mind, BUT this essentially pits everyone who
participates against the AI. If the goal is to create unity, then we need
to leave the door open to NOT changing your mind. That needs to be an ok
option. What needs to be non-optional is welcoming the engagement with the
other side. That's the part that I think has been most missing, and is
where using the AI as "other" could be really powerful. No?

- Highlighting funny interactions sounds ideal, *especially where it makes
people who are unwilling to engage or reconsider look foolish.* Again, if
we make the focus of the program be about lauding Americans who are willing
to engage and reconsider the "other side", and providing a narrative for
average folks to do so themselves, then I think we have something that
could run for multiple seasons.

- One other idea: have A-listers who do NOT fit the voice of the person who
wrote one side of the engagement read their text. I.e., have Betty White
read the text from a male black southern construction worker, or Brad Pitt
read the text from an older woman from the upper east side in NYC. Having
a-list talent provides all the usual draws, and would feed the pool of
people who are willing to engage with the bot.

Technically, it occurs to me that we could just make a website where anyone
could log on and engage with the bot, but that this would be really easy to
spam and would favor younger folks. My suspicion is that email is our best
bet, and that if we require people to submit a photo to start the
conversation that would filter even more strongly towards older and
legitimate users. That's also asynchronous, which would be easier for GPT-3
to work with.

Finally, it may also be possible for the AI to source content to feed the
conversation. No idea if this would work well or not, but if we could train
an AI to review content sent to it (i.e., a "fake news filter") this could
train people to spot fake news AND give us some great comedic content.
Conversely, if a bot gave you a link and asked you if you thought it
mattered to the conversation at hand that might be less confrontational
than a human being saying "read the Wikipedia entry, asshole." Thoughts?

There's really something here, now, and I think that as a proposal it's
getting pretty undeniable. One last note; I'm going to be a part of a
summit in a month or so hosted by Trevor Noah. Might be a chance for me to
get his ear (virtually) to pitch the idea. Do you think that's a fit?

All best,
Josh
