Since the pandemic we=E2=80=99ve all lost a lot of networking =
opportunities; it=E2=80=99s been a while, so I thought I=E2=80=99d =
reconnect directly to see if we could help each other.

Hit me with an update on what you=E2=80=99re working on, check out a few of=
 my current projects (below), and/or suggest a time to chat. I=E2=80=99m =
curious to hear how I can help!

All best wishes,
Josh
