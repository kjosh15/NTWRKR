Josh,

If you are interested in corporate values and culture, I'm wondering if
you'd be interested in reading a document I'd created for my business which
I built and ran for 18 years.

The document was simply called an F. A. Q. and it was a very detailed
description of our mission, our stakeholders and our values, and just as
importantly, what we didn't value and who wasn't a stakeholder. it
described the things our business was predicated on and included the
criterion by which we could know when it was time to shut down. It informed
everything we did. It was a statement of philosophy as much as anything
else.

About 9 years in another firm expressed an interest in buying a majority
stake in my business. They asked me to bring a business plan, create a
pitch book and give a half hour presentation to their chief investment
officer.

I did none of that.

Instead I bought our F. A. Q. and began going through it.

The CIO turned beet red. He said, "What's this shit? I want to see
pro-formas, I want to see technology, I want to see plans. I need R. O. I."

I said, "If we don't agree on first principles then the only thing you will
ever be is a competitor, and there is no way I'm sharing any of that with
you. Your time is valuable, but so is mine. You said you'd give me 30
minutes and I'm taking it. Now, shut up and pay attention."

I walked him through the document. About 15 minutes in his demeanor
softened and as I approached the end he began laughing.

He said, "I've been doing this for 22 years and in no instance did a
business plan survive the first year. And, in every instance where a
business fell apart it was because they and we didn't see eye-to-eye on one
of the things you've addressed. I like what you've done and I want to
invest in your business."

I said, "What business? I haven't even told you what we do yet."

He said, "I don't care. Any business you can run on these terms I want to
be a part of."

I told him that the biggest risk to our business was not to the market or
to our ideas but to the *character *of our investors. For that reason, the
next step was that I needed to interview him, his staff and his major
investors so that I might judge *their *character and determine what
principles *they *live by.

He agreed to that and I spent a half day with them. I even composed a
written test and collected impromptu essays from them. Even if they had not
heretofore lived according to the words they gave me I made it clear I
would hold them to their rhetoric henceforth.

They did pretty well, so I gave them a final test. I had a competing offer
from another firm that was not structured as an equity stake but an
investment management and IP deal where I retained 100% ownership.

Because if the investor bought into my company then we'd be partners
working for the benefit of both of us, I told them to evaluate both the
competing deal and their own and give me a recommendation and I'd do what
they suggest. But, they had to understand that if they recommended I go
with them and later I found out they did it because it was in their best
interest but not mine then they would have one hell of a pissed-off partner.

They did as I asked and spent a day with the competition getting the
details of their deal and auditing their character.

Then they gave me a report recommending I go with the competition and not
them.

This is the power of well-articulated and well-lived mission and values.
Often when  an investor comes along people start seeing an exit strategy
and dollar signs and start jumping through absurd hoops that can often
destroy their focus and even their business.

I didn't have to do that. I had a long-standing document that guided our
behavior and that gave me the courage to dictate terms and interact with
others as I did.

After auditing the investor's character I didn't have to do anything. They
are the ones, for example, who created a business plan for a business as
they could imagine it after we were partners and they submitted it to me
for my approval. And they are the ones who compared that to the competition
and they determined their offer was inferior.

We really didn't have to do anything except be who we are and hold them to
who they said they were.

That is what character is; it is who we are. The first step is to say who
that is so you can know who to be when things get confusing. There were
plenty of well-run endeavors before the mobile device, the personal
computer and even before the discovery of electricity.

There is power in the written word, and IMHO the word and the will are both
necessary and sufficient. That document was everything and I don't think
our performance could have been improved by an app.

If you'd like to discuss values and culture then I'd like to send you that
document if you think you'll have time to read it by next week.

Brooke

P. S. That investor wanted to buy into us in 2005. Every deal they did with
others fell apart by 2009 whereas we went strong through the entire
financial collapse and didn't shut down until 2014 only a few basis points
off an all-time high. We shut down because the conditions on which our
business was predicated had faded and there was no longer a point. Shutting
down isn't what most people do at the top of the business cycle S-curve.
Instead they either drive themselves off a cliff or try to sell to a
greater fool. We could have done that but it would have violated our stated
principles.
