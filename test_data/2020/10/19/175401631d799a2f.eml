Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=

I'll make sure not to email you in the future!

A big part of that seems to be figuring out who you can =

with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; reply with =
an update on your own stuff, or schedule a time(https://josh.is/scheduling)=
 and let's chat!

Looking forward to reconnecting,
