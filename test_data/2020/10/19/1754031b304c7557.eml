Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/ben%40benparr.com/0d270f86-a7c4-46c9-b008-1957ce913733) and I'll make =
sure not to email you in the future!

A big part of that seems to =

get around that by connecting with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my=
 current projects; reply with an update on your own stuff, or schedule a =

Looking forward to =
reconnecting,
