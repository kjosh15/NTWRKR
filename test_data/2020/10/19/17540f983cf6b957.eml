1. "v=3Dspf1 a mx ip4:216.70.64.104 -all" gives GoDaddy the right to send
email as us and authenticate to us for SPF, yes. I can set that in if we
want it, but aren't we sending only via AWS now?

2. I can add the CNAME records you sent as being what AWS is after, but
this would be entirely new to our setup. I'm also not clear how / if that
would affect our SPF records. CNAME records specify redirects from your
domain's subdomains to other domains/subdomains. TXT is used to store
text-based information related to your domain, usually for storing SPF
data. Any insight from your AWS experience?

3. We have several other DNS records that may be relevant:

.indigometrics.com TXT
amazonses:Gl3kan6JyjA+RzwZsj8kSLBjup9fcQFriMLE7urXd/c=3D
.indigometrics.com TXT lagdmliue5cnctca89vjvvsjs7
.indigometrics.com TXT notokenfound
.indigometrics.com TXT udgbe2vo4tsrpi99c1smc5sdbs
_amazonses.indigometrics.com TXT
Gl3kan6JyjA+RzwZsj8kSLBjup9fcQFriMLE7urXd/c=3D

Any of these seem familiar?
