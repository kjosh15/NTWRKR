Yes, if we are targeting him, we should learn about his preference in =
projects. A good call. Let=E2=80=99s bend our deck to fit that style and =
preference.

I think we can safely say that the tactics employed by the AI will =
expose the corruption behind the systems that these people believe =
in=E2=80=94which I=E2=80=99d assume is completely true.

I really enjoyed reading what you had written. I hope I didn=E2=80=99t =
take too many liberties with it. But I do feel that, together, we have =
the beginnings of a powerful proposal.

I=E2=80=99m running nearly a week behind finishing up this other =
proposal=E2=80=94one you may even be interested in as well. More on that =
later. But I=E2=80=99ll turn to focus a few days=E2=80=99 full attention =
on this very soon.

Any news from Bjork?

Thanks and from Vermont,
Matt
