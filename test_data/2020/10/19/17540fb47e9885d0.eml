Been chewing on the video question and keep coming back to wanting to test
it / clarify the messaging before we pay to have something professional
done. What do you think about using a simple animated platform to try to
put something simple together and use that as a straw man to get feedback?
Agreed that a video may be the way to do - right now we def. have all the
buzzwords but no clear "this is what it is." We need to get to that.
