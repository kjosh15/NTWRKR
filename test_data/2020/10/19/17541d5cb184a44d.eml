Alright Jay I just dropped your package at the FedEx store. The FedEx
tracking number is: 397979731523

Inside the box is a servo and a power supply. The servo is from one of my
Crowbox prototypes. After removing it I ran a consistency check on it with
a servo testing device and it checks out fine. The power supply is a bit
over-spec: It's a 5V/4A supply that's larger (physically) than the type I
use in most of my prototypes but I was unable to find any spare 5V/2A
supplies so I sent this one instead. It is known to be good.

Based on the crazy behavior we see from your Arduino board (LEDs blinking,
servo chattering) I suspect your servo is likely the source of our trouble
but the easiest thing to check is the power supply so I'd suggest doing
that first. Just replace your power supply with the one I've sent you- it
will have the same plug. You'll probably see the same behavior but since
swapping the power supply is so easy, I'd try that first. It IS possible
that a power quality problem is to blame but, again, a servo problem is
more likely.

If swapping power supplies doesn't help, then we do the servo: I'd suggest
you leave your existing servo in your Crowbox for now and just disconnect
its wires. Wire up the new servo in its place then fire up your Crowbox.
You can go to the trouble of actually removing your servo and installing
the new one if the new one resolves your issues. Here's the behavior we
hope to see from the replacement servo when you fire up your Crowbox:

-Servo makes one big move (this is the move to the halfway position)
-Pause
-Servo makes another big move (this is the move to 'full open' position)
-Pause
-Servo issues 15 individual, small movement pulses with a tiny delay
between each pulse
-Servo goes quiet and stays quiet

All this time, the only LED that you should see on the Arduino is the power
LED. The other onboard LED should remain off.

If all goes well with the replacement servo, power down your Crowbox and go
back to your own power supply and see if things continue to work properly.
I suggest this simply as a way of determining whether both of these
components were somehow bad, mostly out of curiosity.

Please let me know when you get the package, and how things go with the
hardware replacements.

-Steve

<div dir=3D"ltr">Alright Jay I just dropped your package at the FedEx store=
. The FedEx tracking number is: 397979731523<div><br></div><div>Inside the =
box is a servo and a power supply. The servo is from one of my Crowbox prot=
otypes. After removing it=C2=A0I ran a consistency check on it with a servo=
 testing device and it checks out fine. The power supply is a bit over-spec=
: It&#39;s a 5V/4A supply that&#39;s larger (physically) than the type I us=
e in most of my prototypes but I was unable to find any spare 5V/2A supplie=
s so I sent this one instead. It is known to be good.</div><div><br></div><=
div>Based on the crazy behavior we see from your Arduino board (LEDs blinki=
ng, servo chattering) I suspect your servo is likely the source of our trou=
ble but the easiest thing to check is the power supply so I&#39;d suggest d=
oing that first. Just replace your power supply with the one I&#39;ve sent =
you- it will have the same plug. You&#39;ll probably see the same behavior =
but since swapping the power supply is so easy, I&#39;d try that first. It =
IS possible that a power quality problem is to blame but, again, a servo pr=
oblem is more likely.</div><div><br></div><div>If swapping power supplies d=
oesn&#39;t help, then we do the servo: I&#39;d suggest you leave your exist=
ing servo in your Crowbox for now and just disconnect its wires. Wire up th=
e new servo in its place then fire up your Crowbox. You can go to the troub=
le of actually removing your servo and installing the new one if the new on=
e=C2=A0resolves your issues. Here&#39;s the behavior we hope to see from th=
e replacement servo when you fire up your Crowbox:</div><div><br></div><div=
>-Servo makes one big move (this is the move to the halfway position)</div>=
<div>-Pause</div><div>-Servo makes another big move (this is the move to &#=
39;full open&#39; position)</div><div>-Pause</div><div>-Servo issues 15 ind=
ividual, small movement pulses with a tiny delay between each pulse</div><d=
iv>-Servo goes quiet and stays quiet</div><div><br></div><div>All this time=
, the only LED that you should see on the Arduino is the power LED. The oth=
er onboard LED should remain off.</div><div><br></div><div>If all goes well=
 with the replacement servo, power down your Crowbox and go back to your ow=
n power supply and see if things continue to work properly. I suggest this =
simply as a way of determining whether both of these components were someho=
w bad, mostly out of curiosity.</div><div><br></div><div>Please let me know=
 when you get the package, and how things go with the hardware replacements=
.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>=

ty but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones. Not only do you hav=

 that.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-l=

issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, =
or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which had p=
ower supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior th=
at couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t=

o first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If the syst=
em is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply itself, =
this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes =
cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing i=
t will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This could e=
xplain why your lid behaves the way it does.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p=

u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:1.2in">1) If y=
ou are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connected to y=
our computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The=
 Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection and t=
his is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happ=
en this way.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"ma=

style=3D"margin-left:1.2in">2) Make sure the power supply you are using is =
a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but th=
e servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a powe=
r supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional fricti=
on, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000m=
A) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.<u></u=

 is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your friend, a=
s well. Of the two power supply-related problems I know of, one person was =
using a very weak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand new =

y, my name is Steve and I&#39;m Josh&#39;s partner on the Crowbox project. =
I did much of the hardware design and I designed and wrote all of the Crowb=

I moved my family across the country late last year and then again this yea=
r, so I&#39;ve been sort of unplugged from the project for a while. Josh ha=
s been asking me to help troubleshoot your problem and I&#39;m now finally =
in a position to spend some time working with you to get these problems iro=
ned out.=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"=

 for you, because I know you&#39;ve already done this- Josh sends me a lot =
of support requests and I deal with as many as I can. But this means I don&=
#39;t know exactly what your situation is. So if you could explain your pro=
blem and/or point me to some existing posts in the Crowbox group so that I =
can catch up and devise a troubleshooting strategy, that would be very help=
ful. If I recall correctly, you have a problem we haven&#39;t seen before s=
o our off-the-shelf solutions won&#39;t help you.<u></u><u></u></p></div><d=
