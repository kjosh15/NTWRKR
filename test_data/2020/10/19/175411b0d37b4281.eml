Hi Josh

good to hear from you - it=E2=80=99s been an age. I=E2=80=99ve had a =
pretty tough few months - like everyone -  since February. I managed to =
paint the back wall in my garden, had lots of fun cooking sessions with =
my daughter, half alphabetised my record collection (and then gave up) =
and made a short - on the very cheap - =
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DULJu8P1LTl4 =
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DULJu8P1LTl4> (it=E2=80=99s won an =
award and is getting screened next week, I think,  at the Portland =
Comedy festival) and lots of writing to fill the gaps. Was starting to =
despair a little - not least about paying the mortgage  -  but lucky to =
have picked up contract with a TV production company  - =
http://www.onetribetv.co.uk  - which is a relief, at least until the =
start of December when all that unknowing starts over. I did a spot of =
directing and now I=E2=80=99m writing treatments for short documentary =
film proposals to be screened on a UK magazine show on BBC1 called The =
ONE Show - it=E2=80=99s a bit of an early evening primetime institution =
and I=E2=80=99ve written a lot of films for them in the past. There=E2=80=99=
s a small team of us working - in a lovely office in Bath -  across =
genres. My preferred schtick is history/pop culture and pop science, all =
of which are a lot of fun to research: today I=E2=80=99ve written an =
outline about one of the last women to be tried as a witch in the UK (in =
1944), the first AIDS diagnoses in the UK and, currently, starting to =
research 50 years of Bangladeshi independence=E2=80=A6quite a random =
day!

Come November I=E2=80=99m not sure what I=E2=80=99ll be up to but will =
try not to panic or twiddle thumbs: I do have a few ideas for shows =
I=E2=80=99d like to write up and the people at One Tribe have promised =
me first refusal on anything I come up with, so...

Did someone at Icon forward my email to you  - that was good of them if =
they did, I haven=E2=80=99t been staff there for over a year now.=20

I like the sound of Indigo Metrics - (good name for a circa 1990 =
alt-rock band, too!)  - any more info on that?

All best
Cris
