Maria-Cristina,

Thank you for the information; this is invaluable!! I may be in an odd
position in that I have already co-created a platform which is generating
very interesting and valuable data around behavior change within an
organization, but which really does need a deep and rigorous analysis to
reveal its most important insights. Is there an avenue for pursuing a PhD
with such a platform in hand?

Any thoughts appreciated!

Sincerely,
Josh
