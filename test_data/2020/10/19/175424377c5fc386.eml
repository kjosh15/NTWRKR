A bunch of stuff on just catching up, but the salient bits were:

"Here's something really good to get in front of Cardi B. Details below,
but we're working on a simple asset to pass over if you think we can still
get it. This time around we've got influencers (Kerry Washington, Alexis
Ren, Flea, Rosanna Arquette etc.), we've got producers, we've got a
platform, and god knows we have a clear and present need for her voice. If
there was ever a time for an A-lister to step up on to a platform this is
the one."

Hope you don't mind my using "we" but I wanted to make sure my agent there
pushed this forward and she owes me some favors. Happy to clarify if you
want to make sure things are kept separate - if you'd like to get on the
phone briefly regarding happy to do that too. Otherwise let me know when
you have something we can pass on to be passed to Cardi!
