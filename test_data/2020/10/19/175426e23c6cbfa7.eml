 Glad to hear I'd left such an impression on Jeffrey. :)
Weird that it shows 1am as available - normally it shows 3-5pm GMT (8-10 PS=
T). That said, next week is probably better as this week we're moving to a =
farmhouse down the road (with fiber for internet!!), or suggest a time that=

Hello again Josh,=C2=A0
Sorry for the delay.=C2=A0 Hectic week.=C2=A0 By coincidence, Jeffrey was i=
n my town for a business meeting in Orange county (he lives in Ojai, I'm in=
 Newport Beach) and we had breakfast together this past week.=C2=A0 I had a=
sked him about you and we reconnected.=C2=A0 That was the first time we had=
 seen each other in several years.=C2=A0 He only remembered that you were "=
techy" and ambitious.=C2=A0
Should I assume from your calendar that 8:00am GMT (1:00am PT) on Thursday =
is the only time available this week?=C2=A0 Thursday appeared to be the onl=
y day open and when clicked, only 8:00 came up.=C2=A0 Based on your previou=
s note, I assumed that was GMT, which is 7 hours later than Pacific time.=
=C2=A0 If so, I'll take a look at next week, just let me know.=C2=A0

 Well now I'm really intrigued - normally there's not quite so many gating =
mechanisms! How about a zoom call just to compare notes and catch up? The w=
hole purpose of this outreach was to find folks I could help or collaborate=
 with, so why not see what we're both working on? If nothing else I'd like =
to find out what your name is. :)
If that works, I've got a calendar here - or feel free to suggest a time th=
at works GMT.

Really, really wanted to say something clever after that Grandmaster Flash =
comment, but everything sounded like I was either trying to be hip hop, or =
pornography.=C2=A0
So instead, how about you ping me when you get back from CA and we set up a=
 time? As I understand it you've got an interest in the emerging panopticon=
 that is our modern technolopolitical first world society. I've done a lot =
of work setting up and breaking down parts of it and would be curious what =
you think!

Pleasure to meet you! I once got a draw from a grand master, but he was alm=
ost too drunk to walk. Same principle, presumably. Would love to get togeth=
er for some chess or otherwise; we've got a new baby so will probably miss =
the 4th, but am happy to connect after. What times are good for you?
Jeff, thanks for the intro!! Moving you to bcc to spare you the logistics.

Josh,
Richard is a dear friend of about 10 years, brilliant writer, philosopher a=
