Hi Everyone,=20

We are closing in on October and I wanted to touch base with you all? I =
haven=E2=80=99t made any edits, are we close to creating some final =
pdfs? If you want to do a Zoom meeting and we can work with my doc, that =
would be fine, but I will need some notice.

Thanks,
Michelle
