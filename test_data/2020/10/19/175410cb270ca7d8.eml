s is a really great fundraising brochure. The pics are awesome, and I love =
the specificity of the funding asks. Also, we are such a &quot;do more with=
 less&quot; organization. Funders love that. Are we asking for millions, no=
 way! A few grand goes a long way for us.<div><br></div><div>Is there an ed=
itable version of this? Can we get started on one for prospective=C2=A0pare=
nts? I am happy to help out. I&#39;d love to see the BLM photo on the cover=
 of that one.</div><div><br></div><div>-Cassandra</div></div><br><div class=
