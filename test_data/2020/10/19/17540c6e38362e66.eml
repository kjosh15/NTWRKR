Pinging you one last time: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, =
and to see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and =
the view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call(https://calendly.com/joshua_klein/connect-cal=
l)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest =
Click here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b=
-688c5929/bgelin%40orrick.com/39ba8ac3-88dc-4ab4-b571-ff58796f3279) and =
I'll make sure not to pester you in the future!

Below are a few of my current projects, or just hit me with an =
update on what you're working on. I=E2=80=99m curious to hear how I can =
help!

All best wishes,
Josh

###

Current Projects:

; an AI platform for measuring behavior and beliefs in employees. Super =
useful for newly remote staff, this gives employees clear measures of where=
 and how to improve.

; a project to understand how to use physically =
embedded sensors to reduce the health impacts of obesity, heart disease, =
and diabetes (and hence Covid!)

: as ever, I continue to work with senior =
leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / product =
development.

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this =
outreach, there is a whitepaper .
