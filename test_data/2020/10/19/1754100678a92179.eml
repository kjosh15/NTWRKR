Spoke with a friend who was a big fan of Trevor Noah, and he pointed out
that Trevor's signature move was to expose the dirty tricks behind big
movements.

In this case the =E2=80=9Cdirty tricks=E2=80=9D the AI uses are big data/an=
alytics; what
about these - and the garbage in" signals are we not expecting? My friend
pointed out that it may be much easier to get people to believe in
vaccinations if we encourage them to see it as a race issue in which
primitive people are more infectious, for example. An AI wouldn't hesitate
to use that if it works to achieve its end goals, and lets us highlight
some pretty scary elements.

More grist for the mill - would hate to miss Mr. Noah's support because we
didn't play to his style, anyway!
