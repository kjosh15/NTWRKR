Hi Jay- this is awesome news! Please let us know how things go once you've
installed the new servo so that it can control the sliding lid. Then we'll
know that you're truly back on your feet.

Thank you for replacing components in the order we suggested. The handful
of Crowbox problems we've seen that involve crazy LED/Servo behavior have
been split between power supply and servo issues so I really wanted to know
which you had. Power supply issues are more common than bad servos so I
thought it was worth checking.

Don't worry about sending back that power supply, I don't want this process
to cost you any additional money- you've already invested your time in
troubleshooting with us. I want to thank you for that as well; Your case
was the most involved we've had and I learned some things that will help us
help other builders. At this point it probably makes sense for us to
publish a troubleshooting guide and point out just how likely it is that a
Crowbox problem is related to a servo or power supply.

I had my fingers crossed as I shipped those components out. I felt pretty
sure we were seeing a bad servo but you had already tried two servos so it
was baffling. It's a real bummer that you and your friend apparently
received bad servos, possibly from a bad production batch, I guess. Over
the past two years I've seen DOA rates going up on the low-cost servos that
we recommend for the Crowbox and I don't think there's much we can do about
that aside from recommending more expensive servos, which I'd hate to do.

We're a citizen science project, not a company, so we can't make guarantees
or replace third-party components for all of our builders, but I will look
in my shop and see if I have another spare, functioning servo that we can
send out for your friend's build since we already know her servo is also
bad. I know I have a couple servos left but I'll need to hook them to the
consistency checker to make sure they are good. I'll keep you posted.

Will you please show me where you bought the servos, and which brand? I
think we should start keeping data on DOA servos.

Also, if you choose to post on the Crowbox group to close the loop on your
thread about the problems you were having, it would be helpful if you
mention replacing your servo but not that I provided a servo for you. We'll
continue to help other builders, including mailing out parts, for as long
as I still have spare parts and only a very small group of builders require
that level of support. So I'd prefer not to advertise that we've shipped
out parts. We'll continue to do that privately as long as we're able to
spare the time and parts.

Thanks!

-Steve

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Jay- this is awesome news! Please let us know how thing=
s go once you&#39;ve installed the new servo so that it can control the sli=
ding lid. Then we&#39;ll know that you&#39;re truly back on your feet.<div>=
<br></div><div>Thank you for replacing components in the order we suggested=
. The handful of Crowbox problems we&#39;ve seen that involve crazy LED/Ser=
vo behavior have been split between power supply and servo issues so I real=
ly wanted to know which you had. Power supply issues are more common than b=
ad servos=C2=A0so I thought it was worth checking.</div><div><br></div><div=
>Don&#39;t worry about sending back that power supply, I don&#39;t want thi=
s process to cost you any additional money- you&#39;ve already invested you=
r time in troubleshooting with us. I want to thank you for that as well; Yo=
ur case was the most involved we&#39;ve had and I learned some things that =
will help us help other builders. At this point it probably makes sense for=
 us to publish a troubleshooting guide and point out just how likely it is =
that a Crowbox problem is related to a servo or power supply.</div><div><br=
></div><div>I had my fingers crossed as I shipped those components out. I f=
elt pretty sure we were seeing a bad servo but you had already tried two se=
rvos so it was baffling. It&#39;s a real bummer that you and your friend ap=
parently received bad servos, possibly from a bad production batch, I guess=
. Over the past two years I&#39;ve seen DOA rates going up on the low-cost =
servos that we recommend for the Crowbox and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s =
much we can do about that aside from recommending more expensive servos, wh=
ich I&#39;d hate to do.</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;re a citizen scienc=
e project, not a company, so we can&#39;t make guarantees or replace third-=
party components for all of our builders, but I will look in my shop and se=
e if I have another spare, functioning servo that we can send out for your =
friend&#39;s build since we already know her servo is also bad. I know I ha=
ve a couple servos left but I&#39;ll need to hook them to the consistency c=
hecker to make sure they are good. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</div><div><br>=
</div><div>Will you please show me where you bought the servos, and which b=
rand? I think we should start keeping data on DOA servos.</div><div><br></d=
iv><div>Also, if you choose to post on the Crowbox group to close the loop =
on your thread about the problems you were having, it would be helpful if y=
ou mention replacing your servo but not that I provided a servo for you. We=
&#39;ll continue to help other builders, including mailing out parts, for a=
s long as I still have spare parts and only a very small group of builders =
require that level of support. So I&#39;d prefer not to advertise that we&#=
39;ve shipped out parts. We&#39;ll continue to do that privately as long as=
 we&#39;re able to spare the time and parts.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div=

</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">First- I&#39;=
m really glad you were able to swap the servo and the Arduino. This is real=
ly helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of builds that I&#39=
;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very high quality and re=
liability but we&#39;ve seen problems with some of the clones. Not only do =
you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can stop worryin=
g about that.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"m=

upply issue so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule tha=
t in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which=
 had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behav=
ior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn=
&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order=
 you described.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D=

l" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">First, a fact about servo operation: When th=
e servo first starts to move, it can pull a decent amount of current. If th=
e system is underpowered, or there&#39;s a problem with the power supply it=
self, this current surge can &#39;brown out&#39; the Arduino board and some=
times cause it to reboot. As you know, when the Crowbox reboots the first t=
hing it will do is pull the lid all the way open then step-close it. This c=
ould explain why your lid behaves the way it does.<u></u><u></u></p></div><=

) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connecte=
d to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power suppl=
y. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection=
 and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts ca=
n happen this way.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=
=3D"margin-left:2.8in">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNo=
rmal" style=3D"margin-left:2.8in">2) Make sure the power supply you are usi=
ng is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, =
but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out =
a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional =
friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why we recommend a 2 Amp =
(2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty of available current.=

upply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your frie=
nd, as well. Of the two power supply-related problems I know of, one person=
 was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand=
