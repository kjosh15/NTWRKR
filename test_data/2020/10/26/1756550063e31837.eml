Okay.

Let's talk instead about the idea of a "reputation economy" and what it
means to build a reputation rather than just manage it.

Please understand however that for 30 years I operated in an environment
where my phones and emails were recorded with emails kept forever and
recordings kept for 30 days and everything was monitored by management and
a compliance department.

This was not a bad thing but a good thing because it always kept me on the
straight and narrow.

At this point, having a conversation of substance without a recording feels
like driving without a seat belt.

Therefore, in preparation for the meeting please read my disclosure
statement:

https://brookeallen.com/disclosure/

Pay close attention to the part about keeping secrets.

Talk to you soon.

Brooke
