I've been looking 
at https://www.robotshop.com/en/micro-load-cell-5-kg.html, as a potential 
option to the switches used during training phase 2.

Using weight instead of a simple trigger would potentially better handle 
squirrels and might even allow targeting specific species of corvid. A 
little more complex, probably, but maybe not too much?

I may test this out while I work on my more weather resistant shape file 
design changes.

 yourself around the crowbox area/neighborhood, the crows will lose interes=
t, and the whole the project will not sustain. =C2=A0So what&#39;s the poin=
t?</div><div><br></div><div>My idea, which I&#39;d posted a while ago on th=
e crowbox website forum (I don&#39;t believe I posted here) was to configur=
e a crowbox to accept as currency broken glass bits. =C2=A0Unlike plastic, =
broken glass is semitransparent to transparent, and there are number of opt=
ical sensor configurations that can reliably tell a piece of glass from any=
 other opaque object, such as a twig or what not. =C2=A0 So it would be pos=
sible to detect and thus reward only for this class of trash. =C2=A0 =C2=A0=
</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, like cigarette butts which ARE strewn a=
ll over the place with sufficient density, there are also many places in th=
e world where broken glass bits are just as big a problem and extremely dif=
ficult to clean up by more conventional means. =C2=A0 =C2=A0I know of a spe=
cific beach in Mexico that literally has 20 to 30 pieces of clear, brown, o=
r green broken beer bottle glass (that easily stands out from the backgroun=
d sand) per square meter, for literally MILES of coast line. =C2=A0And I&#3=
9;m not just talking about at the surf line, but extending way above the wa=
ter line from surf to coastal road, hundreds of yards up. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 And=
 there are no less than 20 such stretches of beach in Baja California alone=
. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 These are recreation areas, where volunteers clean up the b=
ig trash, but have simply given up trying to tackle all the broken glass. =
=C2=A0 And so the locals and tourists continue to just chuck their bottles.=
 =C2=A0 (Broken Windows Theory: =C2=A0If we could get the beach pristine ju=
st once, people will begin to stop littering - nobody wants to the be the f=
irst asshole to break a bottle on a pristine beach, but somehow, if the are=
a is ALREADY trashed, it only gets worse). =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0</div><div><=
br></div><div>So, once a crew of crows (which are indigenous to northern me=
xico) picked up the habit, there would months of work for them to do, and c=
ould quite possibly return these beaches to a pristine state.=C2=A0</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>I have checked with a number of Ornithologists at Cornell=
 University and hollywood bird trainers to make sure that the birds would n=
ot be in any danger of cutting themselves or worse yet, ingesting the glass=
 (a major concern of mine) and have been assured that there is very little =
risk of that, particularly with Seagulls, which was my first species in min=
d for this task before I discovered Josh&#39;s project.</div><div><br></div=
><div>Anyway, when I last inquired, Josh didn&#39;t have any kits available=
, so I kinda put my ambitions on hold. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0<br><br>If anybo=
dy thinks they could modify the crowbox to take on glass, I know just where=
 to put it!! =C2=A0 And I&#39;ll bet we could get Corona Beer, Heineken Cor=
poration, or Coca-cola to give us a grant!</div></div></div><div dir=3D"ltr=
