Do I miss my country? No. Do I miss NYC? Parts of it, definitely!

You asked: =E2=80=9CWould you ever work in an established start up/ company=
 instead
of consulting?=E2=80=9D

Absolutely! I spent last q3/4 doing the tech strategy for IDEO in NYC
testing exactly that. I=E2=80=99m keen to work on a variety of products wit=
h an
emphasis on innovation and with senior stakeholders, though, so it=E2=80=99=
d have
to be the right fit. That said, I=E2=80=99ve considered either apple/google=
 for med
tech/AI or consultancies like KPMG/Accenture for innovation and tech. Do
you have any suggestions or connections you=E2=80=99d recommend?


My start up uses short, regular peer-to-peer surveys to model engagement
and alignment of employees over time. Given Covid it=E2=80=99s a hot place =
to be
right now!

Fingers crossed on the election... I=E2=80=99ll check WhatsApp shortly!
