Since the pandemic hit everyone I know - from my kid=E2=80=99s PTA to CEO =
clients of large multinationals - are trying to figure out how to support =
their network.=20

A big part of that seems to be figuring out who you can =
help in the first place. I=E2=80=99d like to get around that by connecting =
with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; reply with =
an update on your own stuff, or schedule a time(https://calendly.=
com/joshua_klein/connect-call) and let's chat!

Looking forward to =
reconnecting,
Josh
