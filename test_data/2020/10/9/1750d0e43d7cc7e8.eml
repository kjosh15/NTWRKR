Alan,

Great talking to you yesterday! Please do send me your deck for E-line
Media for me to pass on to my contact at the CIA University.

In the meantime, do you mind if I put your name in the ring for potential
partners on the CGM project after the initial study? Your comments
yesterday really drove home to me that the study is critical for producing
an initial scoping for experimentation, but that genuine interaction design
is going to be needed to create impact with the results.

Finally, please do introduce me to Sascha. I'd be curious if he can see a
collaboration around IndigoMetrics. I've attached an overview deck just in
case that helps facilitate.

I'll loop back in a month or two regardless of what comes - it was super
fun chatting yesterday and really pulled me out of my usual context of
thinking!

All best,
Josh
