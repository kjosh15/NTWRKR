*TL;DR: I'm looking for tech/innovation consulting gigs, Indigo to target
strategic investors, the CGM project target list is in construction,
and automated media outreach is producing great results.*


Happy Friday! Last week Takeda pushed off contract negotiations by a month
due to "reshuffled priorities" (not a good sign), so *if you have any tips
on technology innovation/strategy consulting needs please pass them my way.*


Separately, Indigo's existing big clients have each expanded their scope
(one in discussion is considering going directly from a 9k person pilot to
a 33k person global rollout) and our pipeline now includes a Formula 1
company and a global telco/technology services company w/ 310k
employees. We're planning on doing a raise this fall, and my goal is to
target strategic investors to produce higher valuations and potentially
solicit a sale. *Any advice/introductions on strategic investors for Indigo
are appreciated!*

The CGM project got some unexpected feedback from a diabetic medical
devices testing manager so I'm rewriting the deck to take this into
account. Once I do I'll develop a fuller strategy alongside a targeted
outreach to World 50 to validate a potential fast-track to an ideal
partnership model. *If you have contacts with any big healthcare firms with
an interest in Diabetes/Heart Disease/Obesity or Medical Devices please let
me know.*

Finally, my media outreach campaign (in which I'm A/B testing automated
emails to ~3.5k past contacts) is going great, with >40% open rates and
>10% clickthrough. That's extraordinarily good for cold outreach, and my
calendar is starting to fill with quality meetings as a result. As the
campaign progresses and I get more targeted I expect this to only improve.
Happy to share my notes as I learn more - this def. seems like a scalable
model for virtualized networking.

As ever, please let me know if I can help you with any of your own ventures!

All best wishes from snowy Iceland,
Josh

P.S. I'm experimenting with different formats on these updates - they're
useful to me (even if you don't read them!) but I also want to make it as
easy as possible for you to see if there's anything useful to you + for you
to give feedback. My last request is for your* feedback on these emails'
format.*
