Just read your Nat. Geo piece:

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/10/birds-are-crashing-into-=
nyc-buildings-and-records-numbers-are-being-rescued/

So, so fantastic to read about the great work you're doing there. I'm in
Iceland at the moment, and the Wild Bird Fund is always part of the story I
tell about why I love NYC. You guys taught me so much as a volunteer -
thank you for what you are doing in that city!!

All best wishes,
Josh
