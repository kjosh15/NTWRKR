To whom it may concern,

I've recently moved to Iceland and am keen to work with companies here
either as an advisor or consultant in new product development or technology
strategy. Most of my work has been in either the US (NYC/S.F.) or the EU
(London/Switzerland primarily), but I've lectured at Bifrost and am
reasonably familiar with the startup scene here (mostly through Iceland
Venture Studio). My impression is that ones' network is critical in
Iceland; do you have any advice on companies or individuals to speak to
about how to add value at a more senior level, either internationally or
strategically?

I bring access to a significant business network after a decade's
consulting work to senior executives of much of the Fortune 500 as well as
deep experience at companies like IDEO, Corning, and others in developing
new and innovative technology initiatives and corporate strategy. My CV,
Board CV, and presskit are attached, and more information is available at
my website (www.josh.is) and on linkedin (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaklein/).

Any advice or connections are appreciated!

Kind regards,
Joshua Klein
