Thrive by Making New Experiences a Habit

[image: The delight of opening a new pursuit imparts the vivacity and
novelty of youth even to old age. ~ Isaac D'Israeli]

Habits are all the rage these days. James Clear has sold millions of copies
of his book Atomic Habits
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/25h2h9u7rrp847b3/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9hdG9taWMtaGFiaXRzLw=3D=3D>
in the last two years, which is cool since I'm mentioned in it. ;-)

And it's true that you have to be consistent to form new beneficial habits.
You've got to focus on process instead of results
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/qvh8h8u8ggm4orfl/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9maXRuZXNzLXN0b3J5Lw=3D=3D>
to develop a new identity.

Next thing you know, you're going to bed
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/g3hnhwue778l6mcr/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9zbGVlcC10by1saXZlLw=3D=3D>
at the exact same time every night. You only eat during a certain 8-hour
window
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/3ohphduq66524zfr/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC93aGVuLXlvdS1lYXQv>.
And you don't let anything interrupt your exercise routine
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/n2hohqunww9x6es6/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9leGVyY2lzZS1oYWJpdC8=3D>.


All of that is fantastic, but it's easy to go overboard and end up
unhappier than you started. Worse, you can settle so far into routine that
you actually stunt your brain and diminish your longevity.

It's a bit of a conundrum:

Is it possible that =E2=80=9Canti-routine=E2=80=9D should also be a regular=
 part of our
routines? That might sound contradictory, but research into brain health
and longevity suggests that regular experience of novelty is essential to a
long, happy life.

That means you also need habitual *novelty*. In other words, you need to
routinely expose yourself to new experiences.

Novelty, by definition, is anything that is new to us, and the experience
of novelty can take many forms: meeting a new friend, learning a new skill,
buying a new outfit, listening to new music, or traveling to a new
environment.

Why is this important? Well, for starters, novelty makes us happier
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/wnh2h6ur992kxni7/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9saWZlaGFja2VyLmNvbS9ub3ZlbHR5LWFuZC10aGUtYnJhaW4td2h5LW5ldy10aGlu=
Z3MtbWFrZS11cy1mZWVsLXNvLWctNTA4OTgzODAy>,
improves memory and learning capacity, and keeps us motivated thanks to the
resulting dopamine rush.

But there's more to it. That motivation leads to a not only a longer
lifespan, but also a superior healthspan
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/8ghqh3ugee62qvik/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9saXZlLWxvbmctc3RheS15b3VuZy8=3D>:


Novelty is so important to well-being that researchers have identified
=E2=80=9Cneophilia=E2=80=9D -- the desire to have novel experiences -- as a=
 predictor of
longevity. People who actively seek out new experiences throughout life
live happier, healthier lives.

New experiences and challenges are also key to continued career success.
The neuroplasticity
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/vqh3hmun229ve9fg/a=
HR0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC95b3VuZ2VyLWJyYWluLw=3D=3D>
of your brain requires novelty, and without it creativity and innovation
are practically impossible. Our brains need to be challenged to see new
perspectives and to integrate new information.

This is a huge benefit of a location-independent business. I travel and
change locations constantly. And yet within that framework of novelty, I
have creative routines and habits I follow that produce better work than if
I chained myself to a desk in one place.

The key takeaway is this: While our brains naturally crave novelty, this
desire can be diminished because our brains also become strongly wired to
the routines we establish. This makes us more likely to cling to familiar
experiences as we get older.

You don't want to act old, do you? Go chase a new experience today ... not
because it's incredibly healthy for your brain; just because it will make
you feel awesome.

sounds tough, and it is. You do it because it increases endurance and
power, burns fat faster, strengthens your heart and cardiovascular system,
and lowers your blood pressure and blood sugar levels. But what may
surprise you is that inactive adults who tried a sampling of exercises
preferred intense efforts to gentler workouts.

Yeah, who isn't feeling overwhelmed in 2020? Well, it's possible that some
people don't feel that way. How can that be? Well, we can't choose what
happens in the world and even in our own lives, but staying in a state of
overwhelm is a choice. Here's how to choose differently.

If it weren't for walking and hiking, this pandemic would have been so much
tougher to deal with for me. Since this thing is still going and perhaps
even getting worse, maybe the new experiences you need will come from
creating a walking habit.

Take a Walk of Wonder

[image: Wisdom begins in wonder. ~ Socrates]

By Trudi Roth

From the annals of the silver linings pandemic playbook, here=E2=80=99s a f=

more than two-thirds of Americans surveyed

by UnitedHealthcare say that since COVID-19 hit, walking has become their
preferred exercise.

Beyond the physical benefits, copious evidence supports the positive
psychological impacts of fitness, including increased satisfaction and
reduced anxiety, depression, and other mental ills.

Walking, in particular, has been shown to boost

creativity, innovation, and problem-solving. This, however, can be a
double-edged sword when facing unprecedented adversity. It can be tempting
to spin on challenges beyond your control.

Luckily, it=E2=80=99s easy to avoid bringing worries along on a walk. With =
a simple
mindful shift, you can enjoy what researchers call an =E2=80=9Cawe walk.=E2=

Take a walk on the wonder side

While nature's awesome power has been humbling in recent months, it=E2=80=
=99s small
wonders that can have a big impact on mood, perspective, and well-being.

Going on the hypothesis that aging into later life can cause social
disconnection, anxiety, and sadness =E2=80=94 things actually affecting peo=
ple of
all ages during the pandemic -- a team of scientists studied two groups of
walkers.

The control was asked simply to take a 15-minute walk outdoors once a week
for eight weeks. How they did that was their choice.

The rest had the same marching orders but were also told to go to new
places and view details with wonderment and curiosity to cultivate awe
<https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/08hwhgum0069zril/a=

bWlnaHQtZG8td29uZGVycy1mb3IteW91ci13ZWxsLWJlaW5nLmh0bWw=3D>.


A somewhat nebulous emotion, awe generally is defined as the sense that you
are in the presence of something larger and more consequential than
yourself and that this something is mysterious and ineffable.

Not surprisingly, the group who took new routes and practiced fresh
perspectives reported feeling more optimistic and buoyant than those who
didn=E2=80=99t.

While it=E2=80=99s easy to appreciate, say, a sweeping ocean landscape or s=

there=E2=80=99s also joy in beholding the petals of a late-season rose or t=

Likewise, if you live in a city, make it a point to check out new
neighborhoods and marvel at vibrant details. For example, you can follow in
the footsteps of Matt Green

HR0cHM6Ly9pbWp1c3R3YWxraW4uY29tLw=3D=3D>,
who has walked every New York City block.

The point is, as the researchers said, to =E2=80=9Cfocus on the world outsi=
de of
your head.=E2=80=9D

The results can be profound. Back to the study, where all of the subjects
were asked to take selfies during their walk. Researchers observed that the
awe walkers=E2=80=99 faces grew smaller as the environment became more domi=

Nothing like that occurred with the control group.

Make walking a daily habit, and along with better health, you get a dose of
enlightenment. Now that=E2=80=99s awesome.

</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">It&#39;s a bit of a conundrum:

=9D should also be a regular part of our routines? That might sound contrad=
ictory, but research into brain health and longevity suggests that regular =
experience of novelty is essential to a long, happy life.
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"color:#333">That means you also need habitual <em>novelty</em>.=
 In other words, you need to routinely expose yourself to new experiences.
</p>
<blockquote style=3D"background:#fafafa;color:#666;font-style:italic;margin=

to us, and the experience of novelty can take many forms: meeting a new fri=
end, learning a new skill, buying a new outfit, listening to new music, or =
traveling to a new environment.
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"color:#333">Why is this important? Well, for starters, novelty =

t new experiences throughout life live happier, healthier lives.

<p style=3D"color:#333">New experiences and challenges are also key to cont=
inued career success. The <a href=3D"https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu=

"_blank">neuroplasticity</a> of your brain requires novelty, and without it=
 creativity and innovation are practically impossible. Our brains need to b=
e challenged to see new perspectives and to integrate new information.
</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">This is a huge benefit of a location-independent bu=
siness. I travel and change locations constantly. And yet within that frame=
work of novelty, I have creative routines and habits I follow that produce =
better work than if I chained myself to a desk in one place.
</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">The key takeaway is this: While our brains naturall=
y crave novelty, this desire can be diminished because our brains also beco=
me strongly wired to the routines we establish. This makes us more likely t=
o cling to familiar experiences as we get older.
</p>
<p style=3D"color:#333">You don&#39;t want to act old, do you? Go chase a n=
ew experience today ... not because it&#39;s incredibly healthy for your br=
ain; just because it will make you feel awesome.
