Sarah,

Saw your advice on the ITP list and wanted to say thanks; it's a weird one
to try to figure out and the assertion that greenback is worth it really
helps.

I also saw that you're in Berlin. My family left for Iceland in June (we
all have citizenship) and are considering moving to Berlin - do you have
any thoughts or advice on life in Germany, in moving to Berlin, and/or what
the tech consultancy world looks like from there?

Very much obliged!!
Josh
