Glad you're doing well!! We've actually moved to Iceland, so probably not
heading out that way anytime really soon (but never say never..) I haven't
heard from Josh lately although I pinged him, so feel free to give him a
punch in the arm for me (or whatever you do for motivation!) Would be good
to catch up.

Outside of all that, what are you working on these days? I recall being
impressed by all the things you were doing; given the pandemic what's
consuming your time and attention now?

All best,
Josh
