Steve,

Are you ok if I include a link to the Swedish guy's training video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dzvmhl-E4QQ0>? He seems to have
successfully demonstrated the process, at least! I thought I'd include the
text "Check out <a href=3D"">this video</a> of Hans Forsberg's training vid=
eo
using his own Crowbox design to successfully train wild magpies!" at the
bottom of the "Why Build a Crowbox" section on the site. Let me know if
that works for you and/or if you can think of a better place!

All best,
Josh
