Yeah it's been forever - one of the big advantages of the pandemic is that
it's forced me to be more intentional around who I connect with and how - I
actually have a white paper I'm working up on the approach I've been using
to network selectively, if it's of interest. So far I've been really
pleased with the outcome, which is basically that I'm spending much more
time talking to people like you again.

Been in NYC for a decade and a half, but am now in Iceland. My wife's from
here and I got citizenship Dec. last year... which was very good timing,
turns out. :)

Let me know if you're game for a call to catch up and compare notes; if
nothing else I may need some security work, and am always in the market for
recommending same. My schedule is here <http://josh.is/scheduling>, or
suggest a time (PST+GMT) that works for you!

All best to you and yours,
Josh
