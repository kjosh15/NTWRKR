Good to know that switching #'s would kill my threads... to hell with that!
I'll stick with the US # in that case (I parked it on Google Voice to hold
on to it in any case...)

#'s here are at an all time high of around 50 cases per day, but dropping
fast. It's a super small country with high compliance, functional
government, and good track and trace + testing.

No, moving in the pandemic was a pain in the ass. Having our apartment
packed up remotely isn't much fun either. OTOH, I think it forced us to
re-examine some priorities along with way, all of which are good things!!

What are you working on these days? How's that going given the pandemic? I
keep talking to other professionals and half of them are loving it and half
are lamenting it... as you said, many folks seem to be waiting for a
vaccine miracle!
