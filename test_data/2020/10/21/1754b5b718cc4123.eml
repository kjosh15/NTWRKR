Cool, thanks! Sounds like we're aligned, and we hope you guys are doing
well and enjoying the place!

Here's a brief summary to make sure we have the same expectations (and as
ever let me know if I'm overstepping or if we need to realign!)

- Kids toys: Send the pics of what Etukai wants when you can.
- Harvard books: You're going to pack these to send by Dec.
- "Stuff to be stored": You're going to pack these now.
- Box of stuff to ship to us: turns out the price for one box was more than
sending 5 boxes. We're trying to find out why now, but may have to send
everything all together. :/

Choose a time here <http://josh.is/scheduling> that works to chat.

Thanks!
Josh

P.S. Yep, got the kids allowance. Much obliged!
