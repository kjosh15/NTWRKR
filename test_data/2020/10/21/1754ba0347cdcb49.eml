Hi Josh,

Sure, no prob.

I love living in Berlin! It happens to suit a majority of my interests
while also being affordable (admittedly, it has become a lot more expensive
in the last 10 yrs, but still half the cost of NYC). I am able to have a
life here I would not be able to afford in new york, including having a
separate studio for a media art practice (that's my German sole
proprietorship) and affordable child care and health care. Again I am
comparing all of this to what it would cost me in new york... I am not sure
how the costs would compare to other parts of Europe, for example.

I also run a software development studio from here (that's the LLC based in
the US). All of my software dev clients are in NYC, based on relationships
i developed while still living there. I was in new york for about 12 years
before coming to Berlin in 2016, and it's been great to be able to continue
my professional connections while in Berlin. From what I hear, there is of
course a lot of tech consultancy activity going on in Berlin, but to be
honest I've been lucky enough to be able to maintain NYC hourly rates with
my NY-based clients, so I've stayed focused on them vs working directly in
the Berlin tech scene.

Berlin is also great for kids, which me and my husband have two of :) It's
difficult to find a spot in a kita (preschool), but the financial support
you receive for having kids in the way of kindergeld and nearly free kitas
is unbeatable compared to NYC. If you do have kids that are age 6 or
younger, you can use this app to find a kita:
https://kita-navigator.berlin.de/

So yeah, from my perspective as a former new yorker, and longer ago, san
francisco resident, Berlin is the best of all the worlds i've been a part
of, but in one place. The main complaint I would have about Berlin are the
dogmatic bureaucratic processes and administrative robots, but i guess
anyone would complain about that :) I mean it took me almost an entire year
to get all my administrative affairs in order here - for example, getting
my visa, anmeldung, health insurance, bank accounts, steuernummer/tax id,
VAT number, accountant, and then for the kids their kita gutschein which
allows them to apply for and eventually attend kita. The language barrier
slowed me down a lot and needing to get a visa was also a big hurdle to get
over, which it sounds like you could skip w/an icelandic passport (the visa
situation, anyway!)

Other thing that has become difficult is finding a flat, since it's become
an even more popular place to come to over the last 5 years. I was lucky in
that my husband was already living here before I met him, so i was able to
just come over and join him here. But if you are on facebook, there are
some good groups that seem to have lots of postings for people looking for
flats, for example: https://www.facebook.com/groups/183048595060764/

Hope some of that helps!

Sarah,

Saw your advice on the ITP list and wanted to say thanks; it's a weird one
to try to figure out and the assertion that greenback is worth it really
helps.

I also saw that you're in Berlin. My family left for Iceland in June (we
all have citizenship) and are considering moving to Berlin - do you have
any thoughts or advice on life in Germany, in moving to Berlin, and/or what
the tech consultancy world looks like from there?

Very much obliged!!
Josh
