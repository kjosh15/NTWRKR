Thrive by Making New Experiences a Habit
----------------------------------------

Habits are all the rage these days. James Clear has sold millions
of copies of his book Atomic Habits (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/25h2h9u7rrp847b3/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9hdG9taWMtaGFiaXRzLw=3D=3D
) in the last two years, which is cool since I'm mentioned in it.
;-)

And it's true that you have to be consistent to form new
beneficial habits. You've got to focus on process instead of
results (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/qvh8h8u8ggm4orfl/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9maXRuZXNzLXN0b3J5Lw=3D=3D
) to develop a new identity.

Next thing you know, you're going to bed (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/g3hnhwue778l6mcr/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9zbGVlcC10by1saXZlLw=3D=3D
) at the exact same time every night. You only eat during a
certain 8-hour window (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/3ohphduq66524zfr/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC93aGVuLXlvdS1lYXQv
). And you don't let anything interrupt your exercise routine (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/n2hohqunww9x6es6/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9leGVyY2lzZS1oYWJpdC8=3D
).

All of that is fantastic, but it's easy to go overboard and end
up unhappier than you started. Worse, you can settle so far into
routine that you actually stunt your brain and diminish your
longevity.

It's a bit of a conundrum:

Is it possible that =E2=80=9Canti-routine=E2=80=9D should also be a regular=
 part
of our routines? That might sound contradictory, but research
into brain health and longevity suggests that regular experience
of novelty is essential to a long, happy life.

That means you also need habitual novelty. In other words, you
need to routinely expose yourself to new experiences.

Novelty, by definition, is anything that is new to us, and the
experience of novelty can take many forms: meeting a new friend,
learning a new skill, buying a new outfit, listening to new
music, or traveling to a new environment.

Why is this important? Well, for starters, novelty makes us
happier (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/wnh2h6ur992kxni7/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9saWZlaGFja2VyLmNvbS9ub3ZlbHR5LWFuZC10aGUtYnJhaW4td2h5LW5ldy10aGluZ=
3MtbWFrZS11cy1mZWVsLXNvLWctNTA4OTgzODAy
), improves memory and learning capacity, and keeps us motivated
thanks to the resulting dopamine rush.

But there's more to it. That motivation leads to a not only a
longer lifespan, but also a superior healthspan (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/8ghqh3ugee62qvik/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9saXZlLWxvbmctc3RheS15b3VuZy8=3D
):

Novelty is so important to well-being that researchers have
identified =E2=80=9Cneophilia=E2=80=9D -- the desire to have novel experien=
ces --
as a predictor of longevity. People who actively seek out new
experiences throughout life live happier, healthier lives.

New experiences and challenges are also key to continued career
success. The neuroplasticity (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/vqh3hmun229ve9fg/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC95b3VuZ2VyLWJyYWluLw=3D=3D
) of your brain requires novelty, and without it creativity and
innovation are practically impossible. Our brains need to be
challenged to see new perspectives and to integrate new
information.

This is a huge benefit of a location-independent business. I
travel and change locations constantly. And yet within that
framework of novelty, I have creative routines and habits I
follow that produce better work than if I chained myself to a
desk in one place.

The key takeaway is this: While our brains naturally crave
novelty, this desire can be diminished because our brains also
become strongly wired to the routines we establish. This makes us
more likely to cling to familiar experiences as we get older.

You don't want to act old, do you? Go chase a new experience
today ... not because it's incredibly healthy for your brain;
just because it will make you feel awesome.

Experience Some Intensity
-------------------------

High intensity interval training (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/m2h7h6uokk6qm4bm/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC9oaWl0Lw=3D=3D
) sounds tough, and it is. You do it because it increases
endurance and power, burns fat faster, strengthens your heart and
cardiovascular system, and lowers your blood pressure and blood
sugar levels. But what may surprise you is that inactive adults
who tried a sampling of exercises preferred intense efforts to
gentler workouts.

The Overwhelming Choice
-----------------------

Yeah, who isn't feeling overwhelmed in 2020? Well, it's possible
that some people don't feel that way. How can that be? Well, we
can't choose what happens in the world and even in our own lives,
but staying in a state of overwhelm is a choice. Here's how to
choose differently.

Walk the Walk
-------------

If it weren't for walking and hiking, this pandemic would have
been so much tougher to deal with for me. Since this thing is
still going and perhaps even getting worse, maybe the new
experiences you need will come from creating a walking habit.

Take a Walk of Wonder
---------------------

By Trudi Roth

From the annals of the silver linings pandemic playbook, here=E2=80=99s a
fun fact: more than two-thirds of Americans surveyed (

) by UnitedHealthcare say that since COVID-19 hit, walking has
become their preferred exercise.

Beyond the physical benefits, copious evidence supports the
positive psychological impacts of fitness, including increased
satisfaction and reduced anxiety, depression, and other mental
ills.

Walking, in particular, has been shown to boost (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu28zvl70i7h3eeddh6/reh8h9uq99l3xdt2/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9mdXJ0aGVyLm5ldC93YWxrLXdvcmsv
) creativity, innovation, and problem-solving. This, however, can
be a double-edged sword when facing unprecedented adversity. It
can be tempting to spin on challenges beyond your control.

Luckily, it=E2=80=99s easy to avoid bringing worries along on a walk.
With a simple mindful shift, you can enjoy what researchers call
an =E2=80=9Cawe walk.=E2=80=9D

Take a walk on the wonder side
------------------------------

While nature's awesome power has been humbling in recent months,
it=E2=80=99s small wonders that can have a big impact on mood,
perspective, and well-being.

Going on the hypothesis that aging into later life can cause
social disconnection, anxiety, and sadness =E2=80=94 things actually
affecting people of all ages during the pandemic -- a team of
scientists studied two groups of walkers.

The control was asked simply to take a 15-minute walk outdoors
once a week for eight weeks. How they did that was their choice.

The rest had the same marching orders but were also told to go to
new places and view details with wonderment and curiosity to
cultivate awe (

).

A somewhat nebulous emotion, awe generally is defined as the
sense that you are in the presence of something larger and more
consequential than yourself and that this something is mysterious
and ineffable.

Not surprisingly, the group who took new routes and practiced
fresh perspectives reported feeling more optimistic and buoyant
than those who didn=E2=80=99t.

While it=E2=80=99s easy to appreciate, say, a sweeping ocean landscape or

), there=E2=80=99s also joy in beholding the petals of a late-season rose
or the elegant sway of tree branches in the wind.

Likewise, if you live in a city, make it a point to check out new
neighborhoods and marvel at vibrant details. For example, you can
follow in the footsteps of Matt Green (

R0cHM6Ly9pbWp1c3R3YWxraW4uY29tLw=3D=3D
), who has walked every New York City block.

The point is, as the researchers said, to =E2=80=9Cfocus on the world
outside of your head.=E2=80=9D

The results can be profound. Back to the study, where all of the
subjects were asked to take selfies during their walk.
Researchers observed that the awe walkers=E2=80=99 faces grew smaller as
the environment became more dominant. Nothing like that occurred
with the control group.

Make walking a daily habit, and along with better health, you get
a dose of enlightenment. Now that=E2=80=99s awesome.
