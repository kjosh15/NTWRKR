Thanks, Cole! I know Gather, but have fallen out of touch; how do you like
working through them?

In terms of podcasts, I was host of Accenture's Innovation Decoded the last
two years, and am negotiating to work with them again in 2021 with a new
production company. I did a bit of a dive into podcasting last year but
couldn't find a targeted way to bring it to my network. Do you have a
process you use to scope business targets I could potentially add value to?

All best,
Josh
