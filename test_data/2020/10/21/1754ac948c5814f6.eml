Hi Josh,

Sure, no prob.

I love living in Berlin! It happens to suit a majority of my interests
while also being affordable (admittedly, it has become a lot more
expensive in the last 10 yrs, but still half the cost of NYC). I am able
to have a life here I would not be able to afford in new york, including
having a separate studio for a media art practice (that's my German sole
proprietorship) and affordable child care and health care. Again I am
comparing all of this to what it would cost me in new york... I am not
sure how the costs would compare to other parts of Europe, for example.

I also run a software development studio from here (that's the LLC based
in the US). All of my software dev clients are in NYC, based on
relationships i developed while still living there. I was in new york
for about 12 years before coming to Berlin in 2016, and it's been great
to be able to continue my professional connections while in Berlin. From
what I hear, there is of course a lot of tech consultancy activity going
on in Berlin, but to be honest I've been lucky enough to be able to
maintain NYC hourly rates with my NY-based clients, so I've stayed
focused on them vs working directly in the Berlin tech scene.

Berlin is also great for kids, which me and my husband have two of :)
It's difficult to find a spot in a kita (preschool), but the financial
support you receive for having kids in the way of kindergeld and nearly
free kitas is unbeatable compared to NYC. If you do have kids that are
age 6 or younger, you can use this app to find a kita:
https://kita-navigator.berlin.de/

So yeah, from my perspective as a former new yorker, and longer ago, san
francisco resident, Berlin is the best of all the worlds i've been a
part of, but in one place. The main complaint I would have about Berlin
are the dogmatic bureaucratic processes and administrative robots, but i
guess anyone would complain about that :) I mean it took me almost an
entire year to get all my administrative affairs in order here - for
example, getting my visa, anmeldung, health insurance, bank accounts,
steuernummer/tax id, VAT number, accountant, and then for the kids their
kita gutschein which allows them to apply for and eventually attend
kita. The language barrier slowed me down a lot and needing to get a
visa was also a big hurdle to get over, which it sounds like you could
skip w/an icelandic passport (the visa situation, anyway!)

Other thing that has become difficult is finding a flat, since it's
become an even more popular place to come to over the last 5 years. I
was lucky in that my husband was already living here before I met him,
so i was able to just come over and join him here. But if you are on
facebook, there are some good groups that seem to have lots of postings
for people looking for flats, for example:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/183048595060764/

Hope some of that helps!

Sarah
