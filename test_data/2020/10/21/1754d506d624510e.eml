Yup, and thanks for getting back to me about it! I=E2=80=99m in no rush =
or anything.

I=E2=80=99ve been having fun with my work around it, and want to see if =
maybe the local crows to Denver will be more motivated to learn the =
machine in the winter / dearth months. That=E2=80=99s primarily what my =
effort is around.

The video thing is a shared concern and one I totally understand. It=E2=80=
=99s entirely up to you if you don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s worth =
doing again and I understand if it=E2=80=99s not at this time. I=E2=80=99m=
 still going to do this work, and will contribute it back in either a =
way you prefer, or by putting it up on GitHub with some documentation =
and notes while I beta test the designs.

I've gotten to nerd out on it, haha, and that=E2=80=99s largely what =
matters to me. You=E2=80=99re welcome to use what I end up with or not, =
it=E2=80=99s a share-alike kinda deal, so I=E2=80=99m here for that if =
it=E2=80=99s accepted, and I=E2=80=99ll do my best to document it well =
and resolve anything that comes up in my beta testing.

Anyway, I=E2=80=99ve done a lot of the things I set out to do, and =
believe I=E2=80=99ve lowered the costs.

The following is from what I=E2=80=99ve documented, and you=E2=80=99re =
by no means obligated to read it. Haha

1. Reduced cost - to do this I=E2=80=99ve consolidated to a single =
color. The design now fits onto one color sheet, a transparent sheet, =
and a styrene sheet. This minimizes the uploads to 3, as the design fits =
within a single 790mm x 384mm sheet, but does limit the material choices =
a bit. Two colors can be achieved by ordering two colors and building =
two boxes. I did this because I'd like to run experiments on color =
performance, so a single sheet was important, as was the ability to swap =
out the basket / and housing subassemblies =E2=80=94 transparency might =
allow some birds to feel more comfortable if they can see the inner =
workings?

2. Separated the design into two main subassemblies that fit together in =
a "slide into place" locking fashion. This removes the side access panel =
and allows the majority of the front to be removed for servicing without =
any fasteners (I=E2=80=99m going to beta test this obviously =E2=80=94 =
but hypothetically it'll work, haha.) This necessitated shifting the =
limit switches to the side panels, and I think improves some other =
aspects that I=E2=80=99ll be verifying.

3. Added an enclosure for the primary electronics so that portion can be =
=E2=80=9Cweatherproofed=E2=80=9D independently of the main housing as =
this was one of my main worries for my climate. If not needed, this can =
be used as the standard electronics sled without building it out =E2=80=94=
 but I have this mounted vertically now which might help with moisture =
retention around the Arduino.

So from my original list:
Added drainage holes to all four corners of the bottom panel.
Moved power hole to the bottom.
Implemented the two subassembly concept, without any fasteners, but may =
expand on this during testing.
Everything is on the metric system and in the raw files almost every =
point is snapped to a mm.
Tested and verified moving the limit switch to the back doesn=E2=80=99t =
work, so shifted them to the side panels.
Removed the perch hook and adjusted the perch to include that =
functionality (consider doubling this layer as it=E2=80=99s likely the =
weakest point from hail.)
Still working to find some universal standard for mounting bolts but =
haven=E2=80=99t yet.
Will expand on the concept of fasteners if needed, but might just use =
hitch pins on #3 if anything is needed at all.
Provided an enclosed electronics sled as an optional build aspect.
Verified that soldering is not required unless you=E2=80=99re not using =
Dupont wires.

Other things:
Improved the coin magazine =E2=80=94 made transparent, added a top that =
can be fastened using hitch pins, and the feet have been improved to be =
interlocked for stability.
All electronic, sensors, and switches are part of the housing, so the =
basket can be removed easily.
The basket is slightly wider and taller now, though I doubt this is =
adding very many sq-cm of additional food.
The basket spine and ramp support stringers slide through from the back =
of the face plate of the basket subassembly now, which provides more =
stability for the basket.
A lot of the shapes from the basket window have been removed, and using =
3mm bolts/nuts is optional if additional support is needed (but I =
don=E2=80=99t think it will be)
The rail frames mimic the interlocking design of the side panels of the =
housing, which allows things to be mounted internally (electronics =
enclosure).
The perch tensioner also allows internally mounted things (electronics =
sled).

allows the majority of the front to be removed for servicing without any =
fasteners (I=E2=80=99m going to beta test this obviously =E2=80=94 but =
hypothetically it'll work, haha.) This necessitated shifting the limit =

working on building a crowbox and my brain has totally latched onto this =
as something I'd like to chip in some of my free time this winter on. =
Thanks so much for all of your efforts everybody, Josh especially. It's =
been really fun to start working on building one, and that's very much =
attributed to your massive efforts and all of the material that's been =
put together so far.<div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">I=
 remember your ted talk from way back and have always loved the idea. =
After some googling I ended up on your project. I was just going to hack =

sitting around, but this is so much better!<div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">@Josh, what are your thoughts on =
creating a repo or two on github or gitlab? One for the code, and one =
for the shape files and pdf print templates etc? I'd consider forking =
the shape files and making some proposed modifications to them -- I've =
got a lot of ideas floating around -- not really "waterproofing it", but =
minimizing water damage potential and making it more weather resistant =
(I'm in Colorado so get to do real world testing, haha).</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Here are some of the =
ideas I've formed so far and will bring as proposals if we had things up =
on github or gitlab. I know full well that a lot of these things may =
necessitate re-recording some of the really amazing videos at some time =
in the future, but I've got a couple solutions about how some division =
in the housing will make it easier to version things, including =
generating new videos in the future.</div><div class=3D""><ol =

replaceable using 3m nuts/bolts/washers&nbsp;(this would allow for minor =

you Josh. How concerned are we in terms of cost associated with the =
