Tristan,

Are you looking to nail it, glue it, screw it, tie it, tape it, or ...? I'd
expect that solid mounting such as weather sealed screws would probably
work best, but a lot will depend on what you're mounting it to. Let us know
what you're working with for a mounting surface and we can advise further.
Stoked to see what you end up with!
