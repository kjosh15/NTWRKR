Stoked to read all this - you're right, a simpler way to fork the designs
would probably be useful. The biggest concern we have is that as a hobby
project we don't have the time to support new versions. The videos have
been tremendously successful in allowing people to make their own boxes,
and having different versions would necessitate new videos, which is a huge
time cost.

Before tackling that, though, let me address your specific questions:

- How concerned are we in terms of cost associated with the housing build?

This has been the top priority. A lot of folks wanted a pre-fabbed kit, for
example, but initial estimates showed that they didn't want to pay more
than $50 for it. We've managed to come in at around $100 for parts, which
we consider a huge success.

That said, it's a new world. It might be worth including a link or testing
out what people would pay for a newer, pre-fabbed version. Is this
something you're interested in, or was your question purely aimed at parts
costs?

- Priority: I'd say cost of build, quality/durability, simplicity of build,
and simplicity in ordering. There hasn't been much noise around color
choices.

Let me know your thoughts on the above!

- J
