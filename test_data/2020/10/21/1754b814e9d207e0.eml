Ideal, thank you so much!! I was very pleased to read the essay you sent -
it so neatly encapsulates your purpose and cogently outlines the problem
sets you're interested in solving! That clarity alone is wildly refreshing.
(I did note that there's a grammatical error in the subhead of your
article, in "wanted to prepare him navigate" - hope that's not being too
pedantic!)

I've attached my resume and presskit. The IndigoMetrics sandbox is
available here:

http://reviews.indigometrics.com/

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$

Take a look and let's set up a time for another call to review each other's
work, where we think we can give each other the best assist, and any
thoughts you might have on the platform.

Looking forward to it,
Josh
