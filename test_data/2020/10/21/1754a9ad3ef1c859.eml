Making sure this didn't fall through the cracks - since the pandemic all =
the time we've saved on commuting seems to have been immediately absorbed =

A big part of that seems to be figuring out =
who you can help in the first place. I=E2=80=99d like to get around that by=
 connecting with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my current projects;=
 reply with an update on your own stuff, or schedule a =
time(https://calendly.com/joshua_klein/connect-call) and let's chat!

Looking forward to reconnecting,
Josh
