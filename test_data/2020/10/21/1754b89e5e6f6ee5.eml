I love Gather! They take a hefty margin but consistently feed me work and I
never have to chase down payments. They've given me the ability to sustain
a life where I can be a present dad, write books in my spare time, etc.,
and I don't have to relentlessly "hustle" to make it all work. I'd be
happy to make an intro if you want to get back in touch.

As for podcasting, the stuff we've done has mostly come about through
existing relationships. C&L produces a thought leadership podcast at IBM
called "Thinkleaders," and then the Automattic thing came about because we
were already doing some editorial work on Longreads (an Automattic
property). Right now my colleague Jason is trying to find a corporate
sponsor for his new podcast Ripcorp <https://ripcorp.biz/> (stories about
why companies die), but we haven't had to aggressively sell podcasting
production as a service, which, maybe we should be!
