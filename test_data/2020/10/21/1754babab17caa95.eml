tally cut off the 4 pieces that appear in the pictures from hard material. =
I went to the factory and asked to cut new from a flexible material that co=
uld curl and not break. They brought me soft but transparent material. Do y=
ou think I should paint it so it will not be transparent? Or it does not ma=
tter cause the peanuts will be on it and hide that it is transparent. Thank=
 you.=C2=A0</div><div dir=3D"auto">All the best,=C2=A0</div><div dir=3D"aut=
