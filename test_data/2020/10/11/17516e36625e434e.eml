Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/aaron_louis%40moma.org/087cd058-8e34-46cd-b837-78ea07d461cc) and I'll =
make sure not to email you in the future!

I figured I'd try =

Looking forward to reconnecting,
