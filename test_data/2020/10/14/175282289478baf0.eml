4kq's:

   - What is success?
   - What is needed for success?
   - What is currently rate limiting?
   - What resources are available?


A few notes based on my understanding/experience with these:

*What is success? *As explicitly, completely, and succinctly as possible.

*What is needed for success?* These are preconditions that would have to
exist for success to be measured as complete. Think Key Performance
Indicators or metrics that illustrate success. $'s, dates, number of
clients/calls/meetings/etc.

*What is currently rate limiting?* These are the things you don't have that
you need to start fulfilling the things you need for success. Not metrics,
but circumstances like introductions, qualifications, materials, etc.

* What resources are available?* It always bothers me that this is last,
but have come to believe there's a reason for it. I.e., if you list your
resources first, you're describing what is needed in reverse. If you
describe what you need and what's stopping you then your resource list can
respond to encompass it.

Anyway, this is my quick-and-dirty go-to strategy format. It's worked well
for me so far on all kinds of projects and yes, describing success is the
hardest part. ;)

Looking forward to talking next time!!
