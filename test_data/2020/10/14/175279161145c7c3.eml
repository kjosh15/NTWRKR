Let me know if you have time for a brief call in the next couple weeks; I'm=
 curious to hear what you're working on and to see if I can help!

All best,
Josh

A big part of that seems to be figuring out who =
you can help in the first place. I=E2=80=99d like to get around that by =
connecting with you directly. Below is a shortlist of my current projects; =
reply with an update on your own stuff, or schedule a time(https://calendly=
.com/joshua_klein/connect-call) and let's chat!

Looking forward to =
reconnecting,
