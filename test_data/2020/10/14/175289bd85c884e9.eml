Hi Sorry for the late answer.=20

Always on the run. Give you the short version - we need to catch up though!
You should aim at Thula, maybe Stefna, Samherji of course. Nor=C3=B0urorka -=
 Erla Bj=C3=B6rg (and Egill), she is your entry there.=20

Busy working in my law office and Eyr=C3=BAn at her practice. We have not ev=
en been attending the Gym.

El=C3=ADsabet is in Akureyri still- due to COVID.

Sorry for short mail. Later ...

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">How is life with El=C3=ADsabet&nbsp;away at school? I=
 can only imagine - it sounds like such a strange transition!!<br>
<br>
Things here are going well; the boys are doing well at their new school and I=
'm busy negotiating some new contracts. Which leads me to two questions:<br>=

<br>
1. As part of your legal work do you ever broker the sale of Icelandic LLCs a=
s operating instruments? I've been working with PWC to figure out how to man=
age my taxes, and they suggested creating an LLC to accept contract income h=
ere in Iceland. I was told there
 is a "word of mouth" market for these instruments (as buying one which is n=
o longer being used may be cheaper than creating a new one) and was curious i=
f you have any insight.
<br>
<br>
2. Are you and your wife available for a walk sometime? Would be great to ca=
tch up and compare notes on the fall in Iceland!<br>
<br>
All best wishes,<br>
Josh<u></u><u></u></p>
