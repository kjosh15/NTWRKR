Just following up: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, and to =
see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the =
view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's worth =
scheduling a brief call(https://calendly.com/joshua_klein/connect-call)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest Click =

929/bradm%40bradmeltzer.com/609cffc4-f527-4b88-aa5b-a698893f56bb) and I'll =
make sure not to pester you in the future!
