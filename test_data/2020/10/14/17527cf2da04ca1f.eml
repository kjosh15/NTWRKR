Josh,

Thank you for contacting us.  

I've run another test at Gtmetrix.com: 

The site is scoring very well on this test, but I see that the TTFB is still fairly long, looking under the Waterfall tab.

I checked the page source for josh.is, and found that there are 250 lines in this site's <head> section that need to process before the page will load.  

This minify plugin could help to reduce the size of the head section for this site, and help with the loading time:

Make fewer HTTP requests / Minify JavaScript and CSS
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-minify/


I then checked your database for overhead, and found no overhead(blank space), so the database is well-optimized.

Then the plugins were checked using Wordpress command line:

$ wp plugin status
Fatal error: Cannot use Kirki\URL as URL because the name is already in use in /nfs/c01/h03/mnt/44066/domains/josh.is/html/wp-content/plugins/neuron-core-bifrost/includes/plugins/kirki/packages/kirki-framework/field-typography/src/Field/Typography.php on line 15
Error: There has been a critical error on your website.Learn more about debugging in WordPress. There has been a critical error on your website.

I then enabled Wordpress debugging on the site, which is now writing errors to wp-content/debug.log 

The same error came up there:

h4xindustries.com@cl02:~/domains/josh.is/html$ tail -f wp-content/debug.log
[14-Oct-2020 14:48:52 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  Cannot use Kirki\URL as URL because                                           the name is already in use in /nfs/c01/h03/mnt/44066/domains/josh.is/html/wp-co                                          ntent/plugins/neuron-core-bifrost/includes/plugins/kirki/packages/kirki-framewor                                          k/field-typography/src/Field/Typography.php on line 15


This is indicating trouble with the neuron-core-bifrost  plugin.  For starters, I'd suggest disabling this plugin to see if this makes a difference to the site loading time or not.  There may be a conflict with this plugin and other plugins on this site, or the bifrost theme that's active on this website. 

I hope this information is helpful, and we will be here at any time to take another look at this website or answer any other questions you may have.

Best regards,

James T.
