Pinging you one last time; let me know if it's worth connecting to compare =
notes. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and the view of the EU/US =
innovation landscape here is dazzling!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally off base feel free to click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/badams%40gmail.com/fdec4c8c-7a78-4ba7-a235-728db93eafe0) and I'll make =
sure not to email you in the future!

I figured I'd try =

you're someone I *enjoyed* working with, and would work with again. Below =
is a shortlist of my current projects; reply with an update on your current=
 projects, or schedule a time(https://josh.is/scheduling) and let's chat!=

Looking forward to reconnecting,
