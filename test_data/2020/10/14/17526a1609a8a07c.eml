Its unclear but I think what they mean is =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99ll pay you =
=C2=A310,000 a month for the product plus =C2=A350,000 if after a year =
the measured behaviours have improved by X=E2=80=9D .

It=E2=80=99s obviously a shot in the dark for the first one =E2=80=93 =
but if we can find a way to put together a partial =E2=80=9Cpay on =
results=E2=80=9D product with Lane 4 it would be dynamite in their =
sector.

Think trick will be to choose the metric =E2=80=93 I am trying to move =
them towards =E2=80=9Cat least 20% of participants have increased their =
score by at least 0.1 over 12 months=E2=80=9D as I think that is the =
most realistic =E2=80=93 but of course still a shot in the dark.

=20

Also spoke to these guys this morning https://www.retailistic.co.uk/ - =
e-learning for the retail sector in the UK with a really good contact =
book. All their e-learning is around technical skills (but it is =
innovative and short form) so the challenge would be explain to their =
clients why they should now be using e-learning to target soft skills =
(without getting the answer =E2=80=9Cspeak to my CHRO=E2=80=9D).

=20

As an aside =E2=80=93 his comment on the new book was =E2=80=93 =
=E2=80=9Cit looks great but it uses too many buzzwords and the product =
offering doesn=E2=80=99t really come alive until you demo it =E2=80=93 =
what you need is animated video=E2=80=9D .

=20

He could generate 5 x 60 seconds video for around $3000 (script, =
animation, voice over) for us =E2=80=93 which would also help him =
position himself to sell the product. Thoughts? Guess we can agree we =
need video =E2=80=93 question is how and when to pursue it?

Sounds good. By risking do you mean deducting costs up front on the bet =
they=E2=80=99ll like it and pay higher fees later?

Had a call last night with Theorum, a consultancy that developed ~900 =
slides of ppt in a produce development training exercise they=E2=80=99d =
like to productive. They=E2=80=99re keen to set a time to demo the =
