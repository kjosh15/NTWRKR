Pinging you one last time: I'm keen to reconnect, hear what you're up to, =
and to see if we can help each other. I'm currently sitting in Iceland and =
the view of the US/EU innovation space is dazzling - let me know if it's =
worth scheduling a brief call(https://josh.is/scheduling)!

All best,
Josh

P.S. If this email is totally outside your interest Click =
here(http://tracking.josh.is/prod/unsubscribe/96bddfa3-38eb-4869-b28b-688c5=
929/asegal%40estee.com/e3987430-9de7-4c35-8e56-a82215068553) and I'll make =
sure not to pester you in the future!
