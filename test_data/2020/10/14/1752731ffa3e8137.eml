Matt,

Here's my initial thinking on the pitch:

###

The internet's technology revolution has arrived, and it is complete shit.
Its attention economy has produced advanced analytics and machine
intelligences which have self-evolved to capitalize on the discovery that
people will spend their attention most willingly on outrage, and that
markets can best be segmented through echo chambers. The result is a nation
divided into as many subdivisions as can be algorithmically split to
consume more attention.

Meanwhile, new AI is developing at a breakneck pace, deepfakes are
pole-vaulting over the uncanny valley, and quantum technology is about to
put liquid nitrogen on the fire.

But what we if did something different? What if we used the exact same
cutting edge technologies being used today to encourage anti-vaxxers or
protest to create cohesion, instead of division? What if we trained our AIs
using dialogue and reason as measures of success? What if we had an AI have
a conversation about the most contentious issues of our time with the most
ardent, fanatical believers... and try to convince them otherwise?

The USA is suffering a crisis of narrative. Nobody hears the others' side,
so there's no dialogue possible. We each live in an artificial reality
crafted by a legion of sales-oriented algorithms. But it doesn't have to be
that way.

We propose combining GPT-3, the most advanced language model in the world
and the very first AI to produce text that's indistinguishable from a
human's, with the most advanced market segmentation data modeling
available, and use it to broker conversations online with every American
who wants to. We'll set the system up to attempt to convince people that
their unsubstantiated beliefs aren't true. With every exchange, be it via
email or the website, the system will learn what is most convincing to whom=
.

Then we'll pull out the most embelmatic dialogues and read them out on the
show.

That's where the magic happens. By presenting the AI as the apathetic,
devilishly clever machine that it is we'll show that people are, in
comparison, just that: only people. The more effective the AI is the more
frightening its potential, and the greater the empathy with the ones who
are being convinced. At the same time, the exchanges map a clear and
relatable narrative for *how* to engage someone who believes in a flat
earth. It shows, relatably and in an all-too-human way, exactly what's
compelling or challenging to followers of QAnon.

In short, it lets the AI be the bad guy, and gives Americans a narrative to
reconciliation. It produces the ideal script for us to talk to each other
over the issues that are dividing us most. It turns out weaknesses, as
humans, into strengths we can use to heal our country.

- J
