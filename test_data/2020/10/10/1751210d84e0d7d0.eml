Also, we wanted to send a box of our kids' stuff over before we get
everything else packed up, but when I scheduled a 52lb, 20x20x15" box to be
dropped off on Oct. 15th the price quoted was $392.14. That's nearly the
amount we paid to ship five such boxes. What's wrong, and how can I fix?

Thanks!
Josh

P.S. The address we were sending to (from Queens) is:

Sk=C3=B3gar l=C3=B3=C3=B0
Akureyri 607
Iceland
