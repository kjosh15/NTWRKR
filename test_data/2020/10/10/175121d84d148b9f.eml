Hey Konrad,

Sorry this is dragging on. :( The record appears to be incomplete - right
now it's only "v=3DDMARC1" and should be "v=3DDMARC1; p=3Dnone; rua=3Dmailt=
o:
josh@josh.is"

Not sure how we got the earlier errors; apologies if what I sent over
previously was incomplete!!

Many many thanks,
Josh

P.S. For the record, the complete record should be:

_dmarc.josh.is IN TXT v=3DDMARC1; p=3Dnone; rua=3Dmailto:josh@josh.is

=E1=90=A7
