Matan,

Thanks for your reply.

The cPanel Shared Hosting is a different hosting plan as well and would
also require migrating from the Grid. It's just less of a commitment when
it comes to cost to try out cPanel before committing to a DV. However that
said all our plans come with a 30 day money back guarantee so you're not
really locked in either way.

In your case to save time I'd actually suggest just starting with the DV
w/SSD on either cPanel or Plesk and if you want help migrating your site
our Advance Support team can help for a one time fee of $100. Then do some
testing and try out the control panel. If you don't like we can swap it for
the other control panel and Advance Support can re-do the migration as long
as it's within 15 days of the initial migration.

If you are ready to get started the DV w/SSD starts at $55 per month ($660
per year) or if you start on a yearly bill there's a 2 month off promotion
for a total of $550 and I can provide an additional 20% off to reduce the
price to $440.

If you have any further questions please feel free to reply to this ticket
in your (mt) MediaTemple AccountCenter or reach out via Chat or Phone
support. We are here 24/7 to assist!

Best regards,

Edward X.
