Hi Cassandra,

Thanks for the positive feedback.

The file has been designed in InDesign. Are you familiar with the =
program? For now, I was asked to just design this one. I think it would =
be best to get the copy where we want it and then I may forward it to =
Josh K. so he may forward it over to some potential donors ASAP.=20

Then=E2=80=A6talk to me about the prospective parents version and =
let=E2=80=99s see if we can start another one with the template we just =
established. I can also put together a contact sheet with all the images =
I have, so in the future, you could say, =E2=80=9Cplease swipe out cover =
photo for 1234.tif=E2=80=9D etc.

I don=E2=80=99t use Word, I truly hate designing and making templates =
there, it would take me 4x as long to build and afterwards, it looks =
like a design from Word; very generic and bland.

In the meantime, if you have Acrobat, you may open the pdf and use =
=E2=80=9Ccomments=E2=80=9D for your copy changes OR you may print the =
document, mark up your edits and send me photos of your changes.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Michelle
