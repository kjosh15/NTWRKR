Thanks, Rita!! We're in Iceland through the new year as our kids are
enrolled in a local school (Covid is very well controlled here, so they're
getting loads of outdoor time, woodshop, playing with kids in the
playground, etc.). We'll see what happens in Nov. before deciding next
steps. Interesting times!

Thanks again for all the hard work you do there; keep in touch and we hope
to see you all again sometime - sooner rather than later!!

All best,
Josh
