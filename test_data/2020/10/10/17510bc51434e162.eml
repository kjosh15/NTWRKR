Ha, I just copied in what you sent me without really reading it.  Sorry 
about that.  It should be working now (modulo DNS propagation).

Take care,

        It looks like the DMARC record isn't set up correctly. One
        service stated that it was currently set up under "_<a

                    <br>
                    course, if you have access to (say) a popular
                    Twitter feed and can <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    measure feedback effectively, yeah, I could see that
                    working.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; As for your book, my oldest is now 7 but
                    (humble brag) he's reading <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; several grades ahead. He's also completely
                    fixated on learning how to <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; "earn." (Probably a side effect of all the
                    online learning platforms <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; his school has subjected him to which gamify
                    the learning process.) If <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; you're ok with it I'd love to hire him to read
                    your book and provide <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; feedback. Do you have a set of questions /
                    feedback you'd like <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &gt; answered after reading it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Huh, I had never thought of paying a 7-year-old to
                    give feedback, but if <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    you're okay with it, it works for me.  The main
                    things I'd want from him <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    are: whenever there is something he doesn't
                    understand, make a note <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    where (and ideally what).  This could really be
                    anything, from "why are <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    there sleepers on the railway line" to "why doesn't
                    character X do this <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    instead?". Most importantly, if there are boring
                    parts I'd like to know <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    where they are.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     From an adult reading, I'd also want to know (1)
                    are there any parts <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    that you don't think are age-appropriate for an
                    ~8-year-old? (2) do you <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    sense any moral message, and if so, what is it? (3)
                    if you didn't <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    already know, when would you think it was
                    written?(4) do you get a good <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    sense of the characters' personalities, or do some
                    (or all) of them feel <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    wooden?  (5) if anything feels awkward or out of
                    place, I'd want to know <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    where that is too.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh, and of course you'll need the URL: <br>

                    &gt; Also, Trump apparently has Covid. I still can't
                    get over the irony.<br>
