                It looks like the DMARC record isn't set up correctly.
                One service stated that it was currently set up under "_<a
                  href="http://dmarc.josh.is.josh.is" target="_blank"
                  moz-do-not-send="true">dmarc.josh.is.josh.is</a>"
                instead of "_<a href="http://dmarc.josh.is"
                  target="_blank" moz-do-not-send="true">dmarc.josh.is</a>".<br>
                <br>
                Can you take a look?<br>
                <br>
