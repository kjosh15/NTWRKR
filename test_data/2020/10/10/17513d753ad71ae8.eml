Alright, great, thanks!

Could you please verify one thing for me: With the servo disconnected,
please power up the Crowbox, wait about 30 seconds (this lets the Crowbox's
Arduino finish closing the lid that isn't actually attached). Thirty
seconds after you boot up the Crowbox, press the Training Phase button on
the Breadboard. I just want to verify that the LED comes on at this time
and blinks a number of times to indicate which training phase you have
switched to. Press this a few times until the LED only blinks one time
instead of issuing a sequence of blinks (I want you to return the Crowbox
to Phase One training). I expect that you'll be able to do this without
trouble.

Once this is done, power down the Crowbox and re-connect your servo. Then
boot up the Crowbox again. PROBABLY you will see that the Crowbox
misbehaves in the way that it has been misbehaving. I don't expect this
experiment to fix anything but moving forward troubleshooting will be
easier in Phase One since there's simply less going on.

IF your Crowbox misbehaves, I want you to try one more thing: Reverse the
POSITIVE and NEGATIVE connections for the Servo on the breadboard. This is
a hail mary but it's worth trying before we move on. So, power down the
Crowbox, reverse the positive and negative servo connections and power up
again. Please let me know in detail what you see when you power up the
Crowbox like this. If there is no improvement, swap the servo wires again
to restore it to the way you had it originally wired up before we move on.

Based on the troubleshooting we've done I feel quite confident that we
either have a power quality problem or a problem related to a faulty servo.
This is perplexing because you said you've also tried your friend's servo
and your friend's power supply. It's not exactly rare to get a bad
component once in a while but it happens. Two bad components seems unlikely
but certainly not impossible. In any event, we may need to ship you some
components that have been in a working Crowbox just to eliminate this
possibility.

Another thing you should do before we move on is double-check that you
haven't accidentally reversed the polarity of the incoming power.
Double-check your pigtail wiring. It looks correct to me in the photos you
sent, so long as the red wire of the pigtail is actually connected to the
positive input from the power adapter. I may ask you to reverse this
wiring, as well, if we don't get any good information from the above
diagnostics.

We have to get out the heavy hammer next. If you are comfortable sharing
your address, I want to mail you a servo and a power supply that I know
work perfectly fine in a Crowbox- I'll take them from one of my well-tested
prototypes.

<div dir=3D"ltr">Alright, great, thanks!<div><br></div><div>Could you pleas=
e verify one thing for me: With the servo disconnected, please power up the=
 Crowbox, wait about 30 seconds (this lets the Crowbox&#39;s Arduino finish=
 closing the lid that isn&#39;t actually attached). Thirty seconds after yo=
u boot up the Crowbox, press the Training Phase button on the Breadboard. I=
 just want to verify that the LED comes on at this time and blinks a number=
 of times to indicate which training phase you have switched to. Press this=
 a few times until the LED only blinks one time instead of issuing a sequen=
ce of blinks (I want you to return the Crowbox to Phase One training). I ex=
pect that you&#39;ll be able to do this without trouble.</div><div><br></di=
v><div>Once this is done, power down the Crowbox and re-connect your servo.=
 Then boot up the Crowbox again. PROBABLY you will see that the Crowbox mis=
behaves in the way that it has been misbehaving. I don&#39;t expect this ex=
periment to fix anything but moving forward troubleshooting will be easier =
in Phase One since there&#39;s simply=C2=A0less going on.=C2=A0</div><div><=
br></div><div>IF your Crowbox misbehaves, I want you to try one more thing:=
 Reverse the POSITIVE and NEGATIVE connections for the Servo on the breadbo=
ard. This is a hail mary but it&#39;s worth trying before we move on. So, p=
ower down the Crowbox, reverse the positive and negative servo connections =
and power up again. Please let me know in detail what you see when you powe=
r up the Crowbox like this. If there is no improvement, swap the servo wire=
s again to restore it to the way you had it originally wired up before we m=
ove on.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Based on the troubleshooting we&#39;=
ve done I feel quite confident that we either have a power quality problem =
or a problem related to a faulty servo. This is perplexing because you said=
 you&#39;ve also tried your friend&#39;s servo and your friend&#39;s power =
supply. It&#39;s not exactly rare to get a bad component once in a while bu=
t it happens. Two bad components seems unlikely but certainly not impossibl=
e. In any event, we may need to ship you some components that have been in =
a working Crowbox just to eliminate this possibility.</div><div><br></div><=
div>Another thing you should do before we move on is double-check that you =
haven&#39;t accidentally reversed the polarity of the incoming power. Doubl=
e-check your pigtail wiring. It looks correct to me in the photos you sent,=
 so long as the red wire of the pigtail is actually connected to the positi=
ve input from the power adapter. I may ask you to reverse this wiring, as w=
ell, if we don&#39;t get any good information from the above diagnostics.</=
div><div><br></div><div>We have to get out the heavy hammer next. If you ar=
e comfortable sharing your address, I want to mail you a servo and a power =
supply that I know work perfectly fine in a Crowbox- I&#39;ll take them fro=
m one of my well-tested prototypes.</div><div><br></div><div>-Steve</div><d=

 supply. Just to get ahead on this issue, can you send me any specs you hav=
e on the servo you installed? A link to the page where you bought it, or a =
datasheet would be perfect. I don&#39;t see how the servo could be drawing =
more than 2 amps and browning out the system, but I do want to double check=
 that.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=

ly and both had bad power supplies- one person was using a 500mA rated powe=

ply that was rated at 2A but did not function properly and deliver clean po=

e four second mark, the LED on the left side of the Arduino (left side in t=
his particular video) flashes three times. This looks to me like the indica=
tion that Crowbox provides when it powers up- three flashes to let you know=
 the box is in Phase Three. I&#39;m pretty sure this means something is res=
etting your Arduino and the whole system starts over, which is why the lid =
enters the startup pattern of pulling to half-way,=C2=A0then full-open, the=
n steps to close and you never see the 20 second feeding period where the l=
id is supposed to remain open. To verify this, can you tell me whether or n=
ot this blinking LED pattern is the exact pattern you see when you power up=
 for the very first time?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mar=

=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">First- I&#39;m really glad you were able to swap th=
e servo and the Arduino. This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have a=
ffected a couple of builds that I&#39;m aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino b=
oards are of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;ve seen problems =
with some of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to s=
wap the board, so we can stop worrying about that.</p></div><div><p class=

=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">Second- Did you make any change=
s at all to the CrOS source code?</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" styl=
e=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=
=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">Right now I suspect there&#39;s a power supply issu=
e so we should check a couple of things to see if we can rule that in, or r=
ule it out and look for another cause. I know of two builds which had power=
 supply issues and both of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior that c=
ouldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS software shouldn&#39;t rea=
lly be able to direct the servo to do. At least, not in the order you descr=
ibed.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=
=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">First=
, a fact about servo operation: When the servo first starts to move, it can=
 pull a decent amount of current. If the system is underpowered, or there&#=
39;s a problem with the power supply itself, this current surge can &#39;br=
own out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you kno=
w, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid all =
the way open then step-close it. This could explain why your lid behaves th=
e way it does.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33=

</div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></=
div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">1) If you are =
running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connected to your com=
puter via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supply. The Arduin=
o can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connection and this is =
not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts can happen this=
 way.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=
=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">2) Ma=
ke sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Ardui=
no only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around=
 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1=
 Amp. If there&#39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000m=
A which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure ther=
e&#39;s plenty of available current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" s=
tyle=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">=C2=A0</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" sty=
le=3D"margin-left:33.6pt">3) If you are already using a power supply, and t=
he power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with=
 your friend, as well. Of the two power supply-related problems I know of, =
one person was using a very weak 500mA power supply, and the other person h=
ad a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was faulty and didn&#39;t supply ste=
ady current.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"margin-left:33.6=
