Hey Josh, so sorry for the late reply! I have been stuck in a hectic studio
shoot and not checking emails. ( Had a few hundred tio go through)

damn, you are definitely up on the game aren't you? I am not as exciting as
you, just been the old story teller.

How are things? Next week will be a real game changer no? All of us are
waiting for some form of stability with American processes and policy!

Kenny
