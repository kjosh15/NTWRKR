Subject: Prep for tomorrow's call

Josh,

I'm thinking about how to prepare for tomorrow's call.

First of all, I don't want to talk about networking or about each other. I
think we have enough of a footprint on the web that we can find out a lot
about each other without taking the time out of the call.

Because you don't have a mission and values statement for your firm we
can't talk about that.

Therefore, I want to concentrate on Indegometrics and how it might be used
to evolve more functional workplace cultures.

I would like to record the audio of our conversation. It would be great if
you could record it as well, as a backup. Would that be okay?

I like these conversations to be like interviews where I am like a
journalist writing a story about your product. In fact, I would like the
option but not the commitment to make an article out of it.

I generally live my life on the record and assume others do the same. In
fact, I have had conversations with people I thought were just curious but
turned out to be reporters working undercover. Although I am not on
assignment for anyone, I would like you to imagine that I am. Before
publication I would show you what I write so you can correct any falsehoods
or quotes out of context, but I won't relinquish editorial control to you.
At a minimum, If I were to publish the entirety of our conversation
verbatim I would expect you not to object.

Now, with regard to specifics...

In my 50 years of work life I have experienced many dysfunctional work
environments. For example, my first paying job was when I was 16 working as
a produce clerk for A&P. Things were fine when I started but I got
transferred to a store run by a guy who yelled at everyone when they did
something wrong. If there ever was a "don't work with assholes" situation,
this was it.

I would like to put together a number of real-life vignettes like this and
present them to you so you can explain how your product could have improved
things had it been deployed in those firms.

Does all that sound reasonable? If not, what would you rather do instead?

Brooke
