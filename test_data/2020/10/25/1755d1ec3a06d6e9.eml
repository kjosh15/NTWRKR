Cool, I'll do an email intro with Christophe Jammet and Jason Oberholtzer
at Gather! Gather works best with big strategic consulting projects with a
tech component, so I can totally see them wanting to tap you for stuff like
that, or you could bring us into something you're working on as extra
firepower.

For simpler content projects, we could have a separate one-on-one convo
with me as Charts and Leisure <http://chartsandleisure.com>, which is the
name Jason and I do our podcast/editorial production under. Cheaper that
way. ;) Please feel free to pass this URL around.

Thanks!
Cole
