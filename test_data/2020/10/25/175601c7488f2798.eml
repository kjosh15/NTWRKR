Turned out more or less as expected - chocolate wasn=E2=80=99t sweet enough=
, but
cinnamon apple was better than I=E2=80=99d anticipated. A mix of apple and =
raisin
is probably the way to go, but I don=E2=80=99t know how to mix the cinnamon=
 in
without a) stunting the sourdough, or b) producing a cinnamon =E2=80=9Claye=
r=E2=80=9D which
dries out between the dough and makes break points as its folded in. Any
suggestions?

These were test loaves, so not pretty enough to take pics - plus with the
new oven a couple had burnt spots, etc. next time!
