Josh, bad client! You know you don=E2=80=99t make these big changes at the b=
lueline stage.

I understand, you probably have more experience with these asks. But perhaps=
 you and Betsy should talk and discuss. I believe Betsy and I felt this was a=
 general corporation ask, the transmittal or accompanying letter would be mo=
re personalized.=20

My two cents, I would be very careful with donor=E2=80=99s brand. This may b=
e looked down upon by many in our school community.=20

My best,
Michelle=20

 I thought were were going to put a request with Betsy's email address at th=
e end? I.e., there's loads of great material about what EB is, what it repre=
sents, and what it needs... but no request that donors give money towards on=
e or more of those subsections, that those donations are tax deductible, or t=
hat the donor's brand can be recognized by the school.
