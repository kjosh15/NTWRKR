Sunday is good timing - being up in the North it's interesting times
Covid-wise...

The Kria fund is high profile and enjoys widespread support, but it's build
on the Innovation Center, which is an absolute mess. I wanted to swan in
and offer my international connections and experience building incubators
to be an advisor / work on the Kria fund itself - as I understand it nobody
managing it has either experience or vision for how to use it for the
advantage of Iceland broadly.

That said, you could certainly do the same. Want to do a quick call to
brainstorm?

All best,
Josh
