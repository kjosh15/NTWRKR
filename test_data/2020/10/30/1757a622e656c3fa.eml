Just got off the phone with Theorem - they have a customer they think would
be a good fit (the gov't of Atlanta, Canada) and think they could sell
their Prime (product management training) product much more efficiently
using Indigo.

Next step is he wants to look at pricing for using a whitelabeled version
of the product. Given recent negotiations with Bechtel do we want to change
our pricing structure, and/or do we want to send any new/revised material
along with it?

Only change that comes to mind to me (beyond potentially pricing) is to
make it clear there's no noncompete. If we're currently looking at
strategic partners/acquisitions, next steps are to talk to the Accentures
and KPMGs and see if they see opportunity the same way Theorem does. If so,
additional noncompetes don't help us.
