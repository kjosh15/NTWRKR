This looks great!!! I'm curious about where the call to action is, though -
I thought were were going to put a request with Betsy's email address at
the end? I.e., there's loads of great material about what EB is, what it
represents, and what it needs... but no request that donors give money
towards one or more of those subsections, that those donations are tax
deductible, or that the donor's brand can be recognized by the school.

I know I'm late to the game here, but wouldn't that make this much more
powerful?
