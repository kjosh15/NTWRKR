Hi Josh,

Yes, please feel free to send the invite for next Monday at 2:30 pm Iceland
time. Part of the reason that I'm not sending one is because my Zoom
account is linked to the college, and there's a chance that I might not be
working there by next week! Today is a big day - both because the college
might announce its plans for the fall, which could include furloughing and
laying off a ton of staff, and also because I have a showdown with a really
toxic co-worker. As transformative as I try to be, it seems like it's going
to be explosive and ugly!

So a lot might be different by the time we speak in five days.

And yes, with regards to Nick, we have decided that we are burning each
other's boats. If I don't get my work done, he has to send $1K of his own
money to Trump's re-election campaign, which is the most abhorrent possible
outcome for him. So, as a friend, I have to do everything to make sure I'm
not putting him in that position!

A lot to discuss on Monday!

Best,
Scott
