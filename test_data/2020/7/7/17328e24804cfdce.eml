We got stuck in the highlands (in Iceland) last night due to a child
bathroom emergency and now are racing to catch up; rather than doing our
call with two cranky kids in a car are you available later this week /
early next?

Apologies to start off our reconnect with a reschedule, but I also don=E2=
=80=99t
want to yell back and forth and unfortunately my in-laws need their car
back!

All best,
Josh
