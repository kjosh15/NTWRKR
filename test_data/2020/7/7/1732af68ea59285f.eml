Phillip,

Pleasure talking to you last week; as ever, I hung up excited about the
possibilities, despite your stern warnings on the inertia in the system.
Truth be told, you're just too enthusiastic a person to have less than an
encouraging effect!

To that end, I think that setting up a virtual topic group for I50 could
work *great*. Some potential issues could include:

- Best practices for managing innovation development in virtualized
environments
- Leveraging M&A and partnerships in the current market
- Human capital and new global opportunities

I'm sure Mike has more ideas.

The bad news is I dug through past emails and found that a few months ago I
suggested something like this to Mike around The Future of Privacy at Work,
and nothing came of it. My expectation is that knowing how it worked for
your groups might create more enthusiasm. I know Mike would like to extend
his offerings, so perhaps if we present this together ...?

I'm happy to do the lift on this myself (you do seem to have a lot on your
plate!) but think I'm going to need more credibility to get it across the
finish line. Let me know what points of evidence you take from setting this
up with your own groups and how best you think this should be presented to
Mike.

If you can help me understand that I'll try to list exactly what the group
is for and some of the activities it will do, describe structurally how it
can use outcomes to feed insights up to members, and outline how members
can elect someone from their org to sit in.

All best wishes,
Josh

P.S. Bonus: does W50 ever help with retained search? I recently reconnected
with a friend who runs such a firm and I've been really impressed with his
methodology - he's amenable to partnering with an org like World 50: would
that be useful to you?
