We got stuck in the highlands (in Iceland) last night due to a child
bathroom emergency and now are racing to catch up; rather than doing our
call with two cranky kids in a car are you available later this week /
early next?

Apologies for rescheduling so last minute, but I also don=E2=80=99t want to=
 yell
back and forth and unfortunately my in-laws need their car back!

All best,
Josh
