Hey Josh! Hope you had a great weekend. How is next Monday, July 13, at
2:30 pm Iceland time/ 7:30 am for me in California? If that doesn't work,
please let me know some alternative times/dates early next week. I'm pretty
flexible right now for the dates of the 13th through 15th.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Scott
