Josh,

Apologies but in speaking with Michael, I missed something.  Relating to
the 2,000 relevant user reset, it doesn't capture many likely cases that
may pop up.  For example, a user does a 15 person trial and then goes to
1,500 after that.  To get around this, if it is under 2,000, it will be %
growth based, which is what his original intent was that got away from me.

Let me know your thoughts.

Tks,
Rick
