We're watching cost of healthcare and education grow in the US past =
where most people can afford them. Even if I can afford to I'd really =
prefer my kids not grow up in a weird bubble of other rich kids. =
Bulgaria is not fully Shengen (I need to do some research to figure out =
how that process is going) but they're somewhere well into the process. =
It's got a fairly high level of corruption so not ideal for starting a =
business (Malaysia same).

I do want to start another company so I'm figuring out both what that is =
and how to avoid it being trapped in the US. Really hard with all the =
distractions. How have you handled moving your work overseas?
