Nick,

Spent some time talking with Chris over the points from our last convo. We
were somewhat divided on what our clients would have an appetite for; his
impression was that the larger corporate clients (our primary targets) were
likely to have internal resources already in place that they would
preferentially want to use for solutions like comms, L&D, etc. and that
being agnostic was an advantage to acquiring working relationships with
them.

In this case, having an array of solutions (3rd party providers) we can
introduce them to is an advantage, but only inasmuch as they're optional
and additive. Positioning ourselves as having a soup-to-nuts solution here
may actually be a negative.

That said, this is just our supposition. We're validating this with clients
over the course of our regular conversations with them and will let you
know what we learn!!

In the meantime, we'd love to set you guys up to try the platform: whatever
the above conversations teach us I'm certain there's lots of space for
collaboration with Canvas 8. Let me know if you're game to give it a try!

- J
