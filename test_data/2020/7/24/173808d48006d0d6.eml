Oooh, ORCAA are just the coolest!! We've looked at their stuff before;
given that we're currently embarking on building out D&I initiatives we may
well want to connect with them in future. Thanks!

Glad to hear you're safe and well, and I'm especially interested in your
passion project as a recent immigrant (possibly even... *refugee*?) myself.
We just got residency in Iceland today, and are enrolling our kids in the
local school Monday. So totally privileged beyond all comprehension, and at
the same time riddled with guilt and remorse and longing. As a straight
white educated middle class male it's been a very very strange few months
indeed, and I'm enormously grateful to be able to engage on multiple levels
- let me know how I can possibly support you in this!

On a separate topic, I've been developing a new networking methodology for
a highly virtualized Covid world which places especial emphasis on
emotional returns as foundational for business development. You make me
look like a piker in all these elements; do you have a particular strategy
for managing your network?

Sending you all best wishes,
Josh
