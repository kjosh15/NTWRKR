My notes from the call w/ BSS yesterday show that we should collaborate on
what to share with them for the initial deck. I think if we send them the
case studies doc + the advantages doc you made we'll be well ahead.

Otherwise I'm trying to get my head around what to tell them, with the
following as a slightly stream-of-consciousness result. Do you have
anything to add, and/or can you send them the two docs above?

IndigoMetrics is in a new operating environment; Covid-19 has overnight
produced a massive workforce of suddenly empowered, newly autonomous
employees. Whereas before the parent-child model of management reigned
supreme, workers are now only a pixel away from conduct risk or being the
real voice of the company... to say nothing of the sudden disappearance of
most mainstream ways of achieving support. The result is a workforce bereft
of clear indications of their success as employees, in any role.

Indigometrics provides this to employees within a framework that is
self-referential, evolutionary, and highly contextual for the organization
it operates in. By regularly evaluating themselves and each other the
language of the company's values, employees are continually steeped in the
framework of those values. Conversations begin to use the vocabulary of
those values, successes are evaluated within their meaning, and challenges
are framed accordingly. The result is cohesive culture, which *still
changes and evolves* over time, but does so within a shared understanding
of who and what the company is.

What's more, it's statistically measured and validated. It's not a plaque
on the wall, it's a moment in time on a spectrum of evolution.
