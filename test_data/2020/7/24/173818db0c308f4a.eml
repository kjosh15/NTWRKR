If Bulgaria is far enough along you might be able to move over, establish
residency, and then hop to a Shengen state. That's our plan if the US can't
reverse course (or show strong signs of recovery) by the new year. Our
current best target atm is Berlin, for numerous reasons (not least of which
is the ability to build companies.)

Another tactic would be to get employment abroad and file for residency
that way. If Bulgaria achieves Shengen first that could expedite the
process, but either way you're moving towards the right target. Given your
resume, again, I think you'd have no problem, and might even be able to
achieve that with some advisory work (which could help lead towards your
founding aspirations).

Moving my work over was seamless; for one most of it was cancelled due to
the pandemic, and for another IndigoMetrics was fully virtual from the
start. So was all my retainer and consulting work. Iceland has four
international trunk lines and fiber to most homes, so I'm getting 100MBs to
my phone, and the 4-hour time difference to GMT isn't too hard to manage as
the kids' bedtime has moved to ~9pm as they've gotten older.

TBH, the pandemic made working abroad a lot easier because everyone expects
everything to be via zoom anyway. Without anyone ever asking for f2f
meetings I'm free to take virtual ones mid-hike in the afternoon because
WTF not?

Let me know how your plans progress and/or if I can help in any way!!
