Did you get a review of the work from ionchannel.io that Jeff Koff and Neda
Oreilly have been looking at? I brought in IonChannel a while back as a
potential security solution for Corning and think next steps should be to
get you collaborating with S2P in checking it out.

Let me know how I can best help; happy to send an overview deck, make a
direct intro for a walkthrough, and/or whatever else.

TL;DR: IonChannel does BOM library reviews for all enterprise software
packages on an ongoing basis to ensure continuous security coverage.

All best wishes,
Josh
