I'd like to schedule an appointment either before August 1st or after
August 10th to look at a sore ankle and remove a wart on one finger. My
kennitala is 1510742279. Please let me know what times are available; I
favor mornings if possible. My hope is that I'll be covered by private
interim insurance by TM at that time; if not I have US insurance.

Takk!
