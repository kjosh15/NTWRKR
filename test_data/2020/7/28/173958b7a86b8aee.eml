Cool - let me know what you need.

In other news, last month we were awarded a contract for Air Force =
software supply chain logistics and continuous assurance - this tees =
into a massive engineering modernization effort, as well as heightening =
of security posture for software deliverables from contractors.=20

If you want to spur a sense of urgency, try forwarding this recently =
published Atlantic Council report: =
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and=
-security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/breaking-trust/ =
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-an=
d-security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/breaking-trust/>

The SBOM recommendation in that report was spurred by a Department of =
Commerce initiative I=E2=80=99m co-leading, which the FDA used in their =
regulatory guidance that Software Bills of Materials will be required as =
a condition of FDA approval for medical devices. Am engaged with a =
healthcare POC that has a lot of the big hospital systems - Mayo, =
Cleveland, NY Presbyterian, Cedars Sinai, Sutters on down the line - =
pulling SBOMs for devices from Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher etc., =
for vulnerability management.=20

If Corning wants to loop into that group, and/or be an anchor for a =
similar POC in manufacturing, the door is open.=20
