Birgir,

Thanks again for all the help! Been spending a lot of time looking at
online info but had a couple questions that are bottlenecking my next steps
and that I hoped were easy:

1. Tax liability:

I've seen two conditions stated; Persons that stay in Iceland for a period
of 6 months or longer over a 12-month period, and/or people who are
residents registered in the national registry. If the former is true but
not the latter that changes our strategy considerably given that we're
considering moving to Berlin in 2021 if Trump is re-elected!

2. Icelandic shell LLC:

I can see why you recommend this, but am not clear on how to set up a
salary if I'm getting 2-8 singular payments a year. This makes it nearly
impossible to set up a repeatable salary. How is this handled?

3. If I set up an Icelandic shell company, is the idea that this company
receives ALL my contract payments directly (as opposed to from a shell
company in the US which would be charged taxes as a passthrough)? An
alternative could be that I keep the US shell company and deduct most of my
Icelandic expenses as business costs (rent, gas, utilities, etc.). What's
recommended?

Let me know if there are quick answers to this or if I should wait until
after your certification to hire you for a one-off!

Many thanks,
- J
