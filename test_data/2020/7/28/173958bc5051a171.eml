We have kennitala and filed for residency last week; I'm only getting paid
by out of the country contracts (for now) but need to figure out if I'm
better off having my US LLC pay me a small stipend and most expenses as
business costs, or if making an Icelandic shell company is better. If your
accountant is familiar with US / Iceland tax issues I'd love to talk to
them!

Many thanks,
Josh
