I started an update install; when you next log in can you use your password
to finish the install and we'll see if that solves the error you've been
getting?

In terms of your power issue, we could possibly buy a replacement battery
(for about $100) and do it at home:

ook-or-macbook-pro/

Or, keep backing it up, move as much as you can to the cloud, and plug it
in whenever you want to use it until we get income and can buy you
something newer. Let me know what you think!

xoxo,
