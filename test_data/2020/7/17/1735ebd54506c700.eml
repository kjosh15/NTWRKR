> Dear All,
>=20
> We, Barri and Kristen, have made the hard and joyous decision to take some=
 personal time off and therefore will not be seeing clients in 2021.=20
>=20
> As we have shared with many of you, last year each of us started thinking a=
bout what we might create in this next time in our lives with our children g=
rown but while we are both healthy and energized. Each of us finds it hard t=
o articulate exactly where we are going as we have some ideas of how we woul=
d like to work for the greater good outside of midwifery, or, in a different=
 way in maternal child family health, but do not yet know where the road wil=
l take us. What we do know is that walking down that road requires more time=
 and focus than each of us has while simultaneously running a home birth pra=
ctice and all of the surrender that that requires. We have both spent the ma=
jority of our adult lives being on call for others and we are privileged, ev=
en if the projects will be in the spirit of restorative and hopefully transf=
ormative justice, to be able to take a year off and listen to and refine our=
 own calling.=20
>=20
> We are already starting to redirect our clients to other midwives in our h=
ome birth community and we are emboldened to take this step knowing there is=
 such a wonderful and growing community of midwives offering stellar care to=
 clients at home.
>=20
> We look forward to your questions, congratulations and replies but we ask y=
ou to understand, with this email going out to our entire community, that we=
 will not be able to reply to everyone quickly.=20
>=20
> Although beginning in January 2021 we will not be immediately available fo=
r care, we will still be monitoring email and you will still have access to y=
our charts through Maternity Neighborhood.

> We will update you as our plans evolve.=20

> Every one of you has added to the knowledge and joy in our professional li=
ves. We could not have done this without you.=20
