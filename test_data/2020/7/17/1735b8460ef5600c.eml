Dear Joshua:

We'd like to remind you to review your Social Security Statement online. The Statement has important Social Security information and, if applicable, estimates of your future benefits.

If you are working, we encourage you to check your Statement yearly to make sure your earnings record is correct. The Statement also will help in planning your financial future.

To view your most recent Statement, please visit www.socialsecurity.gov/reviewyourstatement and sign in to your account.

On June 10, 2017, we added a second method to verify your identity each time you sign in to your account. This is in addition to your username and password. Using two ways to identify you when you log on will help better protect your account from unauthorized use and fraud. Now, when you sign in to your account you will complete two steps:
-Step 1: Enter your username and password.
-Step 2: Enter the security code we send you by text message or email, depending on your choice (your cell phone provider's text message and data rates may apply).

With instant access to your Social Security Statement at any time, you will no longer receive one periodically in the mail, saving money and the environment. Thank you for Going Green!

Please do not reply to this email, as we are unable to respond to messages sent to this address.
