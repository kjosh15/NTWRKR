Hi Josh,

"so the landlord would have to give us notice 90+ days in advance if they
don't intend to offer to renew, and cannot increase more than 5%. Do you
disagree?"
--> You are right about this, based on that link. Thanks for sharing that.

I (Jay) am starting a new job in less than two weeks. Milo and Bri are
looking for work too. In the meantime Milo is repairing bikes at home and
Bri is raising plants and marshalling at some protests. I=E2=80=99m sort of=
 trying
to build a rent history checker website.

Thanks for asking! Hope your trip to Iceland was fun / is going well!

Cheers,
Jay Bri Milo
