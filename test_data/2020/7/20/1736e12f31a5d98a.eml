That works, although 9 and noon your time both work (actually better on my
end if they do on yours.) Either way let me know and yes, please do send an
invite - or I can send a zoom.

Best,
Josh

<br>
Mark, some quick responses to your points as predicate for our call:<br>
<br>
- I mean testing in the <a href=3D"https://medium.com/@AWGHodder/lean-testi=
ng-f900b5a7e82e" target=3D"_blank">
lean</a> sense of the word; i.e., any test which produces empirical results=
 used to drive next-step development decisions.
<br>
<br>
- Development resources meaning firms and/or individuals; for example, I ha=
ve a team I&#39;ve worked with in Canada that&#39;s very execution + data o=
riented who have both strong EE and software capabilities.<br>
<br>
- Audit or assess; either way I&#39;d want to connect with other stakeholde=
rs within the company to understand appetite and capacity before suggesting=
 rollouts that may affect other business components.
<br>
<br>
- Good to hear your pushback on the parallel path. Let&#39;s dig into this =
in our call tomorrow as I&#39;m wary of overreaching and slowing mid-term g=
rowth because of misalignment.<br>
<br>
- Finally, reg. B2B vs B2C: I think it makes a big difference only inasmuch=
 as USDG has direct leverage in a particular solution for either. Scale is =
more achievable, faster, than ever before; the bigger question is what sort=
 of businesses USDG is currently
 built to support (and how it wants to grow). <br>
<br>
Looking forward,<br>

<p>Bill, Mark,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the call last week; lots to think about! Your focus on executing=
 <span style=3D"color:red">
low glamor </span>high-impact solutions which strongly leverage industry in=
sider insight strikes me as very well placed. Even moreso given the worldwi=
de trends we&#39;re seeing in the wake of the pandemic!<br>
<br>
In terms of structure, I would suggest two simultaneous tracks:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Test currently identified opportunity spaces (Wireless Energy and Blockc=
hain, <span style=3D"color:red">
general enhancement of ESG story</span>)<br>
<br>
a. vet same for feasibility, execution requirements, and anticipated ROI<br=
>
b. design tests to validate assumptions about same.=C2=A0 <span style=3D"co=
lor:red">So =E2=80=9Ctests=E2=80=9D to me conjures, rightly or wrongly, ima=
ges of scientific method, a control group, a hypothesis and so on.=C2=A0 Ca=
n we elaborate what a test might mean in this context?=C2=A0 I=E2=80=99d
 be more inclined to use a marketing concept, like =E2=80=9Cmarket test=E2=
=80=9D meaning determining if is there an appetite =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=
=9D for this solution=E2=80=A6and the =E2=80=9Cmarket test=E2=80=9D could b=
e something informal (leveraging USD assets/personnel/relationships) or som=
ething more formal
 (like an actual survey or something=E2=80=A6something we pay for, but whic=
h will give us real data).=C2=A0 I=E2=80=99d almost be inclined to put this=
 as a, and a as b.=C2=A0 Meaning, if we think there=E2=80=99s a market, the=
n we move on to feasibility, execution plan and ROI.</span><br>
c. contract short-term resources to generate validation / learning <span st=
yle=3D"color:red">
also possibly to assist in implementation?<br>
</span>d. assist in managing initial tests, assessing results, and proposin=
g next steps (kill/test/re-invest).=C2=A0
<span style=3D"color:red">YES</span><br>
<br>
The goal here is to get USDG moving fast, early, and ahead of any competiti=
on<span style=3D"color:red"> (YES!)</span>. Note I have access to several p=
otential development resources, if needed.=C2=A0
<span style=3D"color:red">Could you elaborate on development resources?</sp=
an><br>
<br>
<br>
2. Generate capacity for identifying opportunities ongoing<br>
<br>
a. audit USDG&#39;s current assets, capabilities, and relationships.=C2=A0 =
<span style=3D"color:red">
I think this would simply be me describing what we have to you and when I d=
on=E2=80=99t know, running down answers within the company.=C2=A0 Perhaps r=
evise from =E2=80=9Caudit=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cassess and consider=E2=80=9D=
?
</span><br>
b. identify additional innovation opportunities <span style=3D"color:red">Y=
ES!</span><br>
c. build resources to support ongoing innovation as backed by results <span=
 style=3D"color:red">
YES and I have some thoughts structurally on that</span><br>
d. create &quot;roulette board&quot; of innovation options to allow for ite=
rative review and opportunistic partnerships/development in response to mar=
ket changes.<br>
<br>
The purpose here is to generate a nuanced map of USDG&#39;s toolset and pot=
ential high-leverage targets, as well as to fill any gaps in creating and d=
eveloping innovation ongoing.<br>
<br>
<br>
These two tracks can happen in parallel, with cost/results indicating best-=
fit solutions for longer term resourcing.
<span style=3D"color:red">Love the parallel path, but, initially weighted h=
eavily towards 1.=C2=A0 I think it=E2=80=99s important to field the team we=
 have, hit a few singles=E2=80=A6.then as we do that, assess what we need t=
o hit doubles, etc=E2=80=A6.and really score.=C2=A0
</span><br>
<br>
In terms of format, I&#39;d suggest a part time retainer for one year to ge=
t the above achieved, after which we could shift hours as needed. This mean=
s that if we need a bigger push up front to support testing / asset mapping=
 we can ramp up accordingly. Similarly,
 if capacity building proceeds faster than anticipated we can walk back to =
prevent unnecessary spend.<br>
<br>
The above is just some initial thinking - let me know if you think this is =
in line with your understanding of what USDG needs and we can discuss furth=
er Tuesday!<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Thank you, yes, this is awesome.=C2=A0 As the wheels begin to turn, in m=
y reading about wireless power transmission, I think one key decision that =
we (meaning our CEO) needs to make ASAP is B2B or B2C.=C2=A0 I suspect he i=
s going to say B2B, but I don=E2=80=99t know that.=C2=A0
 Would you both agree this is a threshold decision that makes a big differe=
nce in how we think about it?<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><br>
<br>
All best,<br>
Josh <u></u><u></u></p>
<div>
<p><br>
P.S. Separately, Mark mentioned culture building around innovation. As this=
 is additive to the discussion we three had I didn&#39;t include it here, b=
ut have plenty to add on the topic if it&#39;s relevant. Let me know if we =
should include it on our list to cover!=C2=A0
<span style=3D"color:red">I actually think if we do the above, this will ha=
ppen organically.=C2=A0 Basically if our CEO backs, and we are successful, =
the culture will follow.</span><u></u><u></u></p>
