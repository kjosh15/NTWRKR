Fantastic!! Great news across the board, especially around your shower
realization. Am excited to read this next book - your timing is excellent!!

I'm in Iceland currently (my wife is from here), where I'm seeing the
statistical culture measurement app I helped build start to blow up. Covid
revealed that corporations' parent-child relationships with their employees
weren't only inneffective, but no longer plausible with remote workers, who
promptly demanded better insight into how their peers perceived their work
(which our platform does well), and then BLM prompted a consideration of
how/where bias occurred (which our platform also does well.) So lots
happening on that front - might be interesting to talk pursuant your
insights on ICTs!

Otherwise we're starting to see the tech innovation consulting come back,
which is great news for the bottom line. Overall, very (very) interesting
times to be watching organizations evolve.

All best,
Josh
