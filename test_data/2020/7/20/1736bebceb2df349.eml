I'd be pleased to be involved! Not sure I can give a speech, but I can
certainly do a "fireside chat" format or give a short statement followed by
Q&A with an interviewer. Additionally, I'm not currently planning to be in
=C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur on the 22nd of august; may I assume this is a vir=
tual invite?

Many thanks!
Josh
