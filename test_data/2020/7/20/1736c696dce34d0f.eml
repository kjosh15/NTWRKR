This is great!! A few questions:

- What are your specific requests, in order of preference, for Josh / EBS?
- What do you intend to do with/without EBS' support?
- What is your timeline for the above given that EBS doesn't (and likely
won't) know what the Department of Ed is going to recommend for some weeks
(and that they're likely to change their mind even then)?
- How do you think I can best support this effort? I'm happy to continue my
regular meetings with Josh and Betsy, and to explain/elaborate/translate
around this as best I'm able; what do you think is most needed?

Thanks again for pulling all this together - I think this represents a
best-in-class effort that could be really transformational, not just at EBS
but across the nation as people try to figure out what will happen this
fall!!

All best,
Josh
