Josh, please meet Bridget.

As I mentioned Bridget has a consumer confidence product that is ready for
market and ready to scale through a partnership with an established retail
fixturing company.

The market approach seems to align well with your up and coming meeting
with c levels at Lululemon.

Bridget can do a much better job in getting into the details on how and why
this is a strong solution....So, I highly recommend the two of you
connecting + setting up a call to dive in deeper, I have no doubt good
things will happen.


Thanks,
Frederick
