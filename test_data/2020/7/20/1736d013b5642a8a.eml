Sweets,

I did a little brainstorming on things we could do to create a more
nurturing psychological environment while here in Iceland. Do any of these
sound worth pursuing to you? Let's talk!

 - Appt. w/ Serge, jointly and/or separately
 - Recommendation on Icelandic psychologist from Eyrun for H, H & J, or H
and her parents (!!)
 - Schedule additional zoom sessions w/ JH folks for social support
 - identify local resources for community building: art classes, swim club,
hiking club, etc.
 - find project to engage local community: tree planting, movement
practice, survival camp, etc.
 - experiment with schedule to give H specific time to herself
     mornings 8-9,
     Fridays,
     one weekend a month
 - schedule regular check-ins with just H & J to "clean the filter"
     Friday night date night?
     trade off w/ Arnar and Ingunn / Olifur and Eyrun?
 - make "book" for H and I to write exchanges about our feelings and
concerns to each other
 - schedule a regular "parents only" hiking trip
 - enroll in a class together (online or RL)

Again, these are just starting points for finding ways to deliberate
nurture each other more equitably.

Finally, it occurred to me that it may be worth setting up a session with
Serge just to discuss telling boys about our fall plans and helping them
adjust. What do you think?

xoxo,
Josh
