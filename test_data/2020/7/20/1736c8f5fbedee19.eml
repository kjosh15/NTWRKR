1. Thanks so much for the intro to Bill Frerking - we have out second call
scheduled for tomorrow.

2. How can I facilitate your input on setting up a virtual topic group for
I50? If I were there I'd volunteer to do dishes/drive kids/mow the lawn or
whatever, but otherwise can only pledge my undying support to the cause.
Let me know!

All best,
Josh
