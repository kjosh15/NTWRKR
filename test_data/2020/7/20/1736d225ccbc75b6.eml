I got ahold of my SIM, although I'd still like to know how to authenticate
without it - having to swap SIMs, turn off all cell data, etc. is time
consuming and risks AT&T somehow auto-billing me (which they are highly
prone to do if you can't turn your phone on inside a faraday cage...)

Separately, though, when I check the drives being backed up, I see
something like this:

Selected for Backup: 58,622 files / 221,804 MB
Remaining Files: 0 files / 0 byte

or this:

Selected for Backup: 42,885 files / 285,571 MB
Remaining Files: 11 files / 1 KB

Does 11 files / 1 KB mean that there is only 1KB left to transfer? Or does
that latter example mean that only 42,885 files (that are 285,571 MB in
size) are yet to be backed up?

Thanks!
