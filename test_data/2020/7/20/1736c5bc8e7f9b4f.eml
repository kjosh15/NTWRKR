Bill, good luck with those documents!

Mark, some quick responses to your points as predicate for our call:

- I mean testing in the lean
<https://medium.com/@AWGHodder/lean-testing-f900b5a7e82e> sense of the
word; i.e., any test which produces empirical results used to drive
next-step development decisions.

- Development resources meaning firms and/or individuals; for example, I
have a team I've worked with in Canada that's very execution + data
oriented who have both strong EE and software capabilities.

- Audit or assess; either way I'd want to connect with other stakeholders
within the company to understand appetite and capacity before suggesting
rollouts that may affect other business components.

- Good to hear your pushback on the parallel path. Let's dig into this in
our call tomorrow as I'm wary of overreaching and slowing mid-term growth
because of misalignment.

- Finally, reg. B2B vs B2C: I think it makes a big difference only inasmuch
as USDG has direct leverage in a particular solution for either. Scale is
more achievable, faster, than ever before; the bigger question is what sort
of businesses USDG is currently built to support (and how it wants to
grow).

Looking forward,
Josh
