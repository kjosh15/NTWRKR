Thanks Josh!

Here is the polished letter that you can see has been signed by a few famili=
es (and which we are also still sharing with other families outside of JH):

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jaE7X8nCAoE3E5of2vq3vTymeFCCltvtdfiKT77=
ncY/edit

As you can see the appeal has shifted a bit away from primarily an ask for r=
esource and support to set up a satellite school and more to supporting grou=
ps of pods. This preference has emerged since the recent findings of infecte=
d youth in Florida and South Korea and the groups=E2=80=98 increasing prefer=
ence to be more cautious as we start back up in September.

I=E2=80=99m planning to send the letter to Josh around 9am. I=E2=80=99ll cc y=
ou when I send it. Also a few in the group felt I should call Josh back even=
 in parallel with you doing a separate outreach to him. So I=E2=80=99ll plan=
 to call him later this morning.

Let me know if you=E2=80=99d like to chat before speaking with him (or feel f=
ree to call me) Otherwise I look forward to hearing your feedback!

I know you guys are in Iceland time but once you speak with him would you be=
 able to do a zoom call with others from the group so they can hear from you=
 directly your take always?

Thanks again Josh!
Mandy
