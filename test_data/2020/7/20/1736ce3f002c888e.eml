Had a good call w/ Mahesh (CTO) and his team lead on their internal survey
platform. Seems like a good fit; their main goal is to keep business
continuity and keep people happy working, and they have no idea how to
manage that so far.

BTW and FWIW, it was great to have a snappy answer to "how do we protect
our internal IP? Our IT Dept. is really picky about keeping things on AWS."

They've asked for a team mtg. to walk through the sandbox. I'll keep you
posted!
