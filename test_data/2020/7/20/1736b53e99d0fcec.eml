Hi Josh,

Sounds fun. I don=E2=80=99t know Laura Rister. But I=E2=80=99m sure =
Iceland will offer many fun opportunities for you both.

Here=E2=80=99s a quick bite about the concept that struck me the other =
day.

Saving Iceland

Saving Iceland is a cinematic eight-part series that examines the =
advanced technologies being developed around the world to save earth's =
coldest locales from melting as well as the rest of the planet from the =
ever-approaching climate catastrophe. Using Iceland=E2=80=99s glaciers =
and the broader landscape of the country as a recoccuring visual example =
of how climate change is impacting our world, Saving Iceland will =
venture to the far pockets of the globe to unearth research being done =
to save all of Earth=E2=80=99s coldest lands.

Next steps would be to craft a one-sheet. Then if there=E2=80=99s =
committed interest, a treatment.

But as it takes time and money to craft such things, we=E2=80=99d need =
confirmation of interest and to discuss finer details for each step in =
the process.

If not a good fit, no worries though. Looking forward to hearing back.

Tks,
Matt
