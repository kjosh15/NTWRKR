Ha! No surprise - Queens parents are a hungry bunch. FWIW, the "Tree Pod"
gang has asked me to step in to help as a liason. Betsy, do you have a
minute Wednesday morning?

One other topic to hit: Mailchimp. I did some digging and was thinking it
might work as a unified front end so parents can just choose how they get
info from you and the platform can deliver it however they like (SMS,
email, slack, etc.). That way you don't have to experiment / send out
missives on multiple platforms, but can just get on with the next thing.

best,
Josh
