Indeed it has. It's been an interesting few months. Currently exploring a
few options locally and remotely. Doing a little research and consulting
work as well.

We're still in Austin but that's looking likely to change in the near
future. We've been here 13 years, and probably now is a good time as ever
for a change. Time to get out of the South and get closer to family.

Also spun up a bit of a non-profit with some new friends (a PopTech
acquaintance, Nat Manning former CEO of Ushahidi) and old friends at the
end of March called Artist Rescue Trust <https://artistrescue.org/>. Raised
about $100k so far. It's an all-volunteer effort for now but trying to make
it more sustainable via a couple of larger grants we're going after.

Where are you at? What's your world like? Still working with the World 50
folks?

Also apologies for the overdue email back. The past week and a half had me
a bit maxed out.

Todd
