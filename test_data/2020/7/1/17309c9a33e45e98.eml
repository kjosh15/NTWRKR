We're now 90 days out from the expiration of our lease, which means they
can no longer raise our rent by more than 5% nor refuse to offer us one.

I'm writing just in case you have any suggestions about negotiating with
them; should I ask for the new lease via certified mail? Should I suggest a
fee up front? I don't expect you have all the answers, but given what a
great job you all have done so far I thought I'd at least see if you had
any thoughts.

Many thanks!
Josh
