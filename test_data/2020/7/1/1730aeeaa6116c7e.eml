Howdy,
I reached out to my friend at ForcePoint to see who would be a good POC for p=
artnership and am waiting to hear back. I just pinged him again.

Re: Big Spaceship, thanks for the offer. I talked with our marketing dept an=
d so far there=E2=80=99s no interest :/ I=E2=80=99ll ping them again as we s=
tart doing 2021 budget planning.

Glad you were able to get some traction with kali. Curious if you still need=
 some pen test/red team work. A friend in NYC reached out to me letting me k=
now he=E2=80=99s doing contract work now and wondered if I knew anyone looki=
ng for lightweight pentests. Happy to make the connection if you=E2=80=99re s=
till in the market for outside support.
