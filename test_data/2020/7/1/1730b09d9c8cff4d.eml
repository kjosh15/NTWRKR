Bala,

We made it to Iceland; the testing at the airport was a unique experience.
Welcome to our new reality!

Very glad to be here; in a way the distance and time difference is freeing
me up to benefit from my network in a whole new way than in NYC. One of
those aspects has been in tapping into my investor network: so far a hedge
fund and a NY family office manager have expressed interest in Flow.is and
RetinaRisk. They're doing their due diligence and I'll let you know if
they'd like an intro.

In the meantime, I may be in R.vik in the next couple weeks. If so, I'd
love to set a time to catch up on the Icelandic tech scene, how/where to
advise here, your portfolio, leveraging the NYC/Iceland network divide, and
greenhouses. (I'm trying to convince my family to get one since we're
outside of Akureyri and have the space, but need an adequate tech angle!)

Hope you're well,
Josh
