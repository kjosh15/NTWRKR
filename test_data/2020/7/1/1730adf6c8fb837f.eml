A national forest in Iceland sounds much better than a big city right now,
especially since all of the good things about a big city (restaurants,
cultural attractions, etc) are shut down, while all of the bad things are
still in full effect.

I=E2=80=99m doing well, I just sold one of my rentals (the place in Bremert=
on) then
bought a house in San Jose, all in the last 2 months. I was going to wait
after my sale, in case the economy completely collapsed, but I found a
great deal on this little house with a guest house on a full acre, up on a
hill in East San Jose, with great views. It was a trust sale and it needs
lots of work, so I=E2=80=99ll have my hands full for the foreseeable future=
. I
figured it was a good time to deal with something like that, since I am
working from home through at least the end of 2020, and probably shouldn=E2=
=80=99t
be doing anything else anyway.

Do you ever use Houseparty? Since our (me, Ryan, Peter, Dan, etc) annual
trip may not happen this year, we=E2=80=99ve been Doing a Bi-weekly call on=
 Zoom or
Houseparty. It=E2=80=99s usually 9 PM Pacific, so not sure if that Is worka=
ble
Iceland time, but it would be awesome to have you join one of those
sometime soon.
