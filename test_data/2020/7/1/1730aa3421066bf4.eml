Sorry, hiring is just ridiculous at the moment - there's very little I can
do about it. Also, I just got kinda crazy busy at work.

On my kids - not entirely sure why you're asking, but one of them isn't in
the s/w scene at all (currently earning his living [just about] as a paid
dungeon master) and the other works for a consultancy that does mostly
government work...
