We made it to Iceland, so we're currently in a summer house by a national
forest with grandparents providing childcare. Fully epic, if a bit end of
the world-ish. Not sure if we'll make it back to NYC this fall - as ever,
so much is wait-and-see right now...

How about yourself? Still surviving in CA?

All best,
Josh
