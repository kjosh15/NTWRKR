Hi Josh,

I just got off the phone with Milano. He's definitely interested in what
you do, with regards to measuring bias with a high degree of accuracy. And
he was enthusiastic to address your question: "How do we use this to create
greater equity, instead of exacerbating it?"

Right now he is swamped with his work designing a program on equity for the
Ford Foundation. But perhaps in the next week or two, we can brainstorm
ways to work together to address that question.

Meanwhile with regards to 2a and 2b, this might be great to discuss in a
conversation as well. I'm enthusiastic about the possibilities, and think
it would be most fruitful to be able to talk it through.

Please just let me know how your schedule looks between July 6 - July 17.
My wife and I are hoping to be able to take a vacation on July 18th if the
entire world doesn't close down to Americans! Especially here in California
(as well as Arizona, Texas, and Florida), our numbers of COVID cases are
soaring!

Take care,
Scott
