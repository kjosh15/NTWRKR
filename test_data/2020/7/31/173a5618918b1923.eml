FWIW, all the research I've been able to do shows that planes are pretty
safe - their ventilation is thorough and a big advantage, so if the flight
was pretty empty you're in good shape.

+1 on feeling safer with a coordinated response. And +++1 on this fall;
we're very keen on finding someplace warmer (and brighter!) to go to as
things get darker here in Iceland. South of somewhere seems ideal,
depending on the numbers!

All best wishes,
Josh
