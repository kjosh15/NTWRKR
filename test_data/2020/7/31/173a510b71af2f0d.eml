Jamie,

Haven't talked to you since 2012, when you were setting up CIID. I was
recently talking to Toshi Ozawa who mentioned you'd since moved to Berlin
(or at least had a place there!) My family recently moved to Iceland from
NYC and are setting our sights on Berlin this spring, but I'd love to get
your take on the EU generally if you're available for a short call to catch
up. Let me know if you have time in the next couple weeks!

All best,
Josh
