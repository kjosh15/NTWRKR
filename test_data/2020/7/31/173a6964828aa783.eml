They're offering .83 USD > EUR, which is def lower than the current trading
price (.85). I assume that's how they make their margin; can I expect this
to change if it's a larger or smaller amount?

Just looking for a reality check before I pull the trigger on your
recommendation!

Hope you've had a good hike!
