I use backblaze - highly recommended. Not sure about rates but they=E2=80=
=99re
comparable to the industry. Best practice is to have all your machines use
backblaze and your personal machines back up locally (using attached
external drives) to a machine that also uses backblaze, for redundancy both
geographically and in regional stores.

As for the bday, our friends Ella and Valur stayed with us for a couple
days and we had a
BBQ and sang happy birthday. I think it went well. :)

Lots of love,
Josh
