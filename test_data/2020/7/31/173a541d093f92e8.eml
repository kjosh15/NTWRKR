Thanks, making the trip was a bit nerve racking, but the flight was empty an=
d so felt OK. I am looking forward to being back in France. Even though numb=
ers are creeping up there, at least there is a coordinated effort to thought=
fully deal with it.=20

I think you guys made the right choice to stay. Maybe we will have a chance t=
o see each other either in Iceland or France this fall!=20
