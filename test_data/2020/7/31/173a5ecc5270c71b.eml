My existing medical coverage should cover everything EXCEPT covid-19
related medical expenses. I'm not looking for trip cancellation or anything
like that; I only need to have any medical expenses related to COVID
covered should I need tests, diagnosis, medical care, or hospitalization
for myself or my family (we're 47, 41, 7, and 4).

Can you do that?

Thanks!
- J
