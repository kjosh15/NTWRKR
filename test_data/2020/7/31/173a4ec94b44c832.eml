Hi Josh,
I hope this finds you all well. Are you in the city? I=E2=80=99d been =
thinking about you all in another way as we had a client move several =
blocks from you and had been meaning to hook you up. And then the =
pandemic.=20
You=E2=80=99re offer could not have come at a better time for several =
reasons. I=E2=80=99d love to catch up with you and I also think I=E2=80=99=
m better able to explain some of the concepts in my head in a linear =
way. ha.=20
I=E2=80=99m off call from the 4th through the 10th and have flexibility =
for time.=20
My best to Hulda, Othinn and Haakon!
Warmly,
Barri

Wonderful to hear you're taking the time needed to chart a considered =
