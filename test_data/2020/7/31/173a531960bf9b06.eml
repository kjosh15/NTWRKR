We spoke to Seth last week - congrats on making the trip!

We decided to stay at least through the new year. By then we'll be enrolled
in EU healthcare and we will have more options, and/or the US will have
turned a corner and it'll be a hopeful and fun place to see come back.
Either way we found a sweet little school just down the road, with 45
students and 46 staff. They're super flexible and mostly focused on being
outdoors, and their day ends around 9am EST... when our school in NYC comes
online for full remote teaching. Since I'm working with the NYC school to
help them get funding and to shape their remote program, and since both
schools are very flexible, we're going to mix and match to find a balance
that works for the boys.

It's still very strange, though. Unlike yourselves we didn't intend to stay
when we left our home and so we're sort of refugees - but we're very glad
to be here nonetheless. Are you going to be glad to go back to France?

Hope you have a great time in the meanwhile,
Josh
