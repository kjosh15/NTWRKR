Looking forward to catching up tomorrow, but in the meantime:

Tonight I worked in Dad=E2=80=99s eponymous =E2=80=9Chickory dickory dock=
=E2=80=9D poem into a
story for the boys and Othinn was so taken with it he repeated it to
multiple audiences. =E2=80=9CThat one=E2=80=99s my grandpa=E2=80=99s!=E2=80=
=9D He explained with enthusiasm.

Later, Haakon was very upset by bedtime and when I said =E2=80=9Cgoodnight =
boys, I
love you=E2=80=9D he promptly yelled, =E2=80=9CI hate you!=E2=80=9D

In the silence that ensued Othinn sighed loudly, put his hand to one side
of his mouth, and stage whispered to me =E2=80=9Che=E2=80=99s in one of his=
 moods!=E2=80=9D

Hulda and I tried not to but we broke out laughing, and soon we were all
giggling, Haakon included.

Love you guys,
Josh
