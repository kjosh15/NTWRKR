OK; here are the questions we=E2=80=99d need answers to so we know where to=
 take
this:

1. How big is the production - (how many actors and staff comes from LA)?
2. What is the budget?
3. Where is the financing at?
4. What kind of location do they need?
5. What do they need in terms of crew and service?
6. Who is the producer?
7. When are they planning to shoot?

In favor of Iceland is that film crews from US can come on a =E2=80=9Cquara=
ntine b=E2=80=9D
license, which means self-sustained facilities. (So you can arrive together
and work together right off.)

The currency exchange is also good at the moment, there are lots of a kille=
d
professionals, and there is a huge willingness to make things work.

Plus, Iceland has started producing a ton of fabulous microbreweries, so
when you get some time off we can celebrate a reunion in true global style.
;D

Let me know about the above and I=E2=80=99ll revert more info to you soones=
t!

Aim told me about your Iceland movie mogul thing and I passed along to an e=
