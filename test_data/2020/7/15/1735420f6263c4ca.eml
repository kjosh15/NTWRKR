This is all great Josh thank you!

So I spoke with Laura Rister - superb producer of APTEROS, the movie I=E2=80=
=99m in and she is super interested in Iceland (particularly the quarantine i=
mmediate start thing). She would love to talk to you - would you be ok with m=
e introing you?

And also we need to figure out your title. I vote for Icelandic Co producer.=
...!

e smaller you need to know more about the production before you source. For e=
xample, if you want to shoot in a barn... there's a barn that's soundproofed=
