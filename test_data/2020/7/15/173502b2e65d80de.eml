Hi Josh,
how have you been? so much has happened in the world since we last met.

I did transition to InVision recently, and I'm loving it. I have a unique
opportunity to rebuild research at InVision at a very interesting point in
time for the company and the industry. I'm hiring a small team, getting to
know people and practices, and liking this honeymoon period a lot. Samsung
quickly proved to be a bad fit for me. Misalignment of expectations from
day one. When we talked I was probably still at the phase where I was
hoping it was growing pains, but.. it was just painful. no growing. So I
feel extra grateful to have found a position I'm excited about (especially
in these times).

How about you? when we met last time, you were reconnecting with your
network, looking for the next thing. How has that been going? have you
been able to make any progress in this crazy time?

great to hear from you,
Nili
