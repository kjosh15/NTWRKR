Any introductions are appreciated, and in any case Cecile sounds amazing!!
I'd love an intro if you feel comfortable making it.

In terms of real estate, we're used to the "decide within 30 seconds of
walking in the door because the person behind you will take it otherwise"
school of thought pioneered in NYC. The other factor is that we have a
2-bedroom, 80-square meter apartment an hour outside of Manhattan for
$2,500/month, so anything larger for less seems like gold. And we'd prefer
to be nearer to the center inasmuch as it translates to access, but after
being in Iceland for a bit are also keen on access to parks and the
out-of-doors... so there's certainly flexibility.

Wrap up your end of the year period and let's talk; as always the situation
is ongoing!!

All best wishes,
Josh
