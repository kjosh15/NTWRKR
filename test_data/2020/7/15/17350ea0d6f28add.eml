Hey mang,

Sorry for delayed response. I am bogged down in stock charts and getting a
ridiculous amount of email from every lame ass investment service out
there. So how old are your kids? My daughter Austin had her 31st birthday
earlier this year. Nothing really prepares you for having grown up kids.
Are you mostly in NY these days and just visiting iceland? What's the
dealio?

So to answer your question. The whole covad thing pretty much made for no
work for me during march and april so i got on unemployment. I got nice big
first check and had all this time on my hands. So i decided to teach myself
stock technical analysis(i would wait for the movie), and invest my
goverment cheese in the stock market. After a couple months of reading and
setting brokerage account, and getting my new laptop all set up i finally
pulled the trigger last week. I will give an update to my wild success in a
few weeks. Gotta go scan me some stocks.
