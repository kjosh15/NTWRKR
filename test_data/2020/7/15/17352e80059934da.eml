Wanted to share a couple short notes from my call w/ Josh this morning.

1. They're talking to the Brooklyn New School to look at outdoor school for
UPK-K grades.

2. ATM it looks like kids will be doing 1 day a week or fully virtual this
fall.

3. Platforms they're looking at are Seesaw for younger kids and google
classroom for older kids. DOE has been pushing iplan (
https://www.iplanportal.com/), but it seems too complicated so far.

xoxo,
Josh
