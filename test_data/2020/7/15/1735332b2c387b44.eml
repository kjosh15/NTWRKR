Josh, meet Scott, and old friend and founder of Transformative Action
Institute who has changed innumerable organizations for the better.

Scott, meet Josh, the rock star principle of the Ella Baker school who
somehow made switching to remote schooling in a pandemic a net positive.

I've told you both a bunch about each other and (I strongly suspect) you
have lots to talk about; Scott is leaving for a well-earned rest at the end
of the week, but given that time is pressing for teachers' setting up their
curriculums he mentioned he may be available Friday morning might work any
time before 10:30 am PDT/ 1:30 pm in NY.

I leave it to you two from here; keep me posted!

All best wishes,
Josh
