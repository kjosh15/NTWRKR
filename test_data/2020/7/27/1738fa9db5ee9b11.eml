When isn=E2=80=99t tax year iceland
When am I tax resident?
May make sense for me to go somewhere else for a bit to avoid hitting that
residency
How does Iceland treat non domestic income?
=E2=80=9C=E2=80=9D if you=E2=80=99re a permanent vs non permanent resident?
How do they define when you earn the income?
=E2=80=9C=E2=80=9D invoice date or when cash hits your bank account?
Depending on where you are rules from US ... ok, need a tax guy.
Ask guy smari introduced me to?
I can pay H a certain amount each year for being a director before a higher
tax rate - ask Stephanie!!
Can claim enormous amounts of expenses in Iceland to H4X - moving, gas, etc=
.

See OFX.com to transfer funds US to Iceland cheaper; can I do euros in
Icelandic bank?

Setup Icelandic shell company? Is it cheap to set one up?
