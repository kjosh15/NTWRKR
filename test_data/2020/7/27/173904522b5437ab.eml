Anna Hildur,

I spoke with Laura Rister, the director of the film that's looking to shoot
in Iceland, and got some more details. Most pertinent is that they seem to
have funding (although are looking for more): the language she used was new
to me. To whit, she said:

The budget is $5-6mm, but the total depends on what soft money they get.
Right now Arclight has soft money onboard to sell foreign, but if they end
up doing it with streamer (like Netflix) she will just do a kill fee. She's
prepared to do it independent if need be.

For your other questions:

1. How big is the production - (how many actors and staff comes from LA)?

They're still casting but will bring in the key roles - DP, production
designer, most of heads of depts
They=E2=80=99re casting now


2. What kind of location do they need?

It's all shot in a spaceship
Want to build contiguous spaceship (not broken up) if possible
Could be an airplane hanger - just need big space


3. What do they need in terms of crew and service?

As much as possible! That decision is mostly cost based, but she's eager to
hire locally.


4. When are they planning to shoot?

Targeting December as a first window, but can be anytime.


She had some questions; mostly about costs behind insurance and bonding. Do
you have any insight into this? She's also looking for additional funding
if it's available here. Primarily she needs to know about crew and shooting
options.

Is this information we can get readily, or does it require some digging?
Are you interested in helping get this off the ground, or does it still
smell too much like vapour?

Hope you're well,
Josh
