Just keeping the ball rolling. I'm talking to William later this week,
thanks! In the meantime, let me know about that material for Gulfstream and=
 the
event at the end of August.

Also, I may be bringing a film from LA to shoot in Iceland. Fingers'
crossed!

All best,
Josh

Excellent talking yesterday! To follow up on some points in our conversatio=
n:<br>
<br>
1) You mentioned knowing an Irish social media guy doing D&amp;I work who m=
ight be interested/ing to talk to about the D&amp;I work we&#39;re doing on=
 IndigoMetrics. Can you introduce?<br>
<br>
&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ve messaged William, waiting to hear back from him.<br>
&gt; Here&#39;s their website btw: <a href=3D"https://www.theworkeragency.c=
om/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.theworkeragency.com/<=
/a><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Happy to talk to Jeannine Haas, CMO at Gulfstream, about the opportunity=
 in Iceland for aerospace. Do you have any links / references / short summa=
ry of key points I could use to describe this?<br>
<br>
&gt; Not really; I&#39;ll try to throw something together quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Happy to present at the event at the end of August. How do I get officia=
lly signed, is there any budget whatsoever, and where can I learn more to s=
cope? Similarly, what&#39;s the ask/offer for outside thought leaders I mig=
ht intro/invite?<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#39;ll talk to my assistant at the prime minister&#39;s office and g=
et him to assemble that info and get back to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Otherwise give me a week or so to catch up and then let&#39;s schedule a ti=
me for me to come back to R.vik for a day or two so as to connect more broa=
dly with the business / political community there. I&#39;d be eternally gra=
teful for your help in this one!!<br>
<br>
&gt; Deferring to Signal chat on that :-)<br>
<br>
Finally, I&#39;m looking forward to talking through =E2=80=9Cthe big game=
=E2=80=9D together - definitely an over-beer topic to get into detail. So m=
any opps...!<br>
<br>
