Awesome, thanks! On a separate note, do you think it's worth applying for
unemployment? It's looking likely that I'm going to sign one or more
contracts here shortly, but I figured I'd look for whatever aid I can get
in the meantime!

Also, as a heads up we're in Iceland and will likely stay through the new
year. Do you have any advice on managing income through our LLC (which is
based in NY - should we move it?), payouts to H and/or I to mitigate taxes,
or the use of an Icelandic company to achieve same?

Hope you're well,
Josh
