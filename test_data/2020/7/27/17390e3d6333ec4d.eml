Understood. Location is, as you know, everything...

Love the idea of making this a community project. Not sure what the
situation is with the kids in NYC atm - in fact, that's a big factor in us
waiting it out in Iceland until the new year. 1 day a week via subway
travel just doesn't make sense, especially when there is a local school
with 45 students, 45 staff, and 1/2 time in outdoor play available ten
minutes down the road here...

I know some parents at the Garden school if an intro would be helpful. How
are things going for you all otherwise??
