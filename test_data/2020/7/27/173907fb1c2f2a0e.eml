Thanks for this, Mark. I think this could work as a good base. A few
thoughts that might help amortize the write-down on my end:

a) I'd need this to be a 6-month commitment at least to make sense. Happy
to set a three month rolling review and a six month rolling retainer if
that makes everyone more comfortable. Normally I do one-year retainer
agreements.

b) One of the areas I'm looking to build professionally is in board seats.
Is there an opportunity for that here? This could be worth a lot in terms
of writing off the haircut.

c) Similarly, I'd prefer to cap it at three hours a week, of which two
could initially be allocated for calls. In my experience, a fair amount of
work gets moved to email as we work together, especially as deployment and
testing begins. Additionally, setting this as a retainer means we can add
hours as needed without committing you to more spend ongoing.

d) Is there opportunity for equity at a later stage? If we're successful at
growing USDG's innovation potential I expect to see many more chances for
growth in the future. Having a chance to earn-in on subsidiary projects or
companies could be very useful.

Let me know where you stand on the above,
Josh
