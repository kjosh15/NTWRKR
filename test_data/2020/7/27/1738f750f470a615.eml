Hi Josh,

Settling back into Spain. Getting through the EU border was more =
difficult than expected.

It depends on your relationships with those in Iceland and who you were =
interested in partnering with. That would be the starting point.

The first step would be identify a group that you feel represents such =
an idea, an Icelandic equivalent to the National Science Foundation =
perhaps.

So I=E2=80=99d have a think about who in your contacts there best =
represents such an idea. And then we can craft a one sheet to gage =
interest from them.

And then we can discuss a network, if there=E2=80=99s a devoted interest =
from a group there.

Hope that helps.

Matt
