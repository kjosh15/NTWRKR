Very cool!! Keep me posted on the crypto side especially as I know the guy
who runs BlockFolio and he has a pretty rare purview...

If I can help with the futurecasting at all happy to be of aid. Really
curious what you're getting asked!!

The company is IndigoMetrics.com, and we're currently getting a major brand
overhaul. We got out of the gate as a white-labeled platform so the site
and related materials are all really basic, but since COVID we're getting
approached by an increasing number of multinationals... So watch this space=
!

Be well and let me know how I can help,
Josh
