Hi Josh,

This sounds interesting and I am interested in working on this with you. I
would get my friends at Polar Film involved as they have the expertise I
lack.

Regarding casting there are several actors in Iceland who are known at an
international level or international actors with Icelandic connections so
let us know if it would be useful to them to get such a list. Here are some
few links for them to look at but the list is much longer.

ote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi Josh,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Good to speak to you earlier.=
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Here are the questions we would need answers to so we know=
 where to take this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. How big is the production - (how ma=
ny actors and staff comes from LA)?<br>&gt; 2. What is the budget?<br>&gt; =
3. Where is the financing at?<br>&gt; 4. What kind of location do they need=
?<br>&gt; 5. What do they need in terms of crew and service?<br>&gt; 6. Who=
 is the producer?<br>&gt; 7. When are they planning to shoot?<br>&gt;<br>&g=
t; In favour to Iceland is that film crews from US can come on quaranteene =
b license which means self-sustained facilities.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The curren=
cy exchange is good at the moment.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Skilled professionals.<b=
r>&gt;<br>&gt; Willingness to make things work.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Depending o=
n the answers to this we can look at whether it makes sense to take this fu=
