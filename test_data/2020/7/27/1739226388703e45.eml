Been back and forthing just today - we=E2=80=99re trying to drive it up the=
 food
chain internally to get more traction. Your email wasn=E2=80=99t badly plac=
ed;
let=E2=80=99s see if it rouses them, and otherwise I=E2=80=99ll use it to d=
o another push
inside.

If that doesn=E2=80=99t work we can take a higher-risk approach and bring i=
t up
with another contact I have in another branch of the company. It=E2=80=99ll=
 step on
some toes (hence my avoiding it to date) but if we think this is a dead end
could be another tack to try.
