Jealous of you being in Iceland. That would be a good trade for the heat of
Austin and the craziness of the US.

Congrats on the startup momentum! That's great. What as the name of it
again? I want to pass it along to a couple of folks who may be interested.

Oddly enough I've been talking to Burning Man a bit about "the SXSW way"
with a few ideas they are going after to keep their event going. But most
of my work has been on the research side. More or less trend hunting/future
casting for a few clients that don't have the bandwidth to go down the
rabbit holes of the future and try to make sense of the next 12 to 18
months. So a bit of the "SXSW way" in that.

And in another far off universe, I'm trying to think of ways to make it
easier for low tech skilled people to make passive crypto income from
projects like Arweave or Filecoin. FYI not really a "crypto guy" but my
friend works for Multicoin Capital so I hear a lot about the things they
invest in. So it piqued my interest and got to thinking about how to lower
the barrier to entry for people.
