Hey Josh,

I'd love to be on the Accenture podcast! Let me know how we can set it up.
I've got the requisite mics, etc. And am sure that we'd have a great
conversation. Did I send you my previous podcast? I did this one
<https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/boiling-the-ocean/id1332312052>with
a friend...

Not sure about the corporate side - let me check in with my clients.

Rocknroll!

Mike
