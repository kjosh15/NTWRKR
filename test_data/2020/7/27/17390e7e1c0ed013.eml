I need to transfer some funds from an account in the USA as well as accept
some payments - rather than do it in dollars can I accept these funds in
Euros?

For example, if I transfer these funds via OFX.com I may be able to receive
them at a better rate in Euros than in ISK.

Any advice is appreciated,
Josh
