Mike,

Been noodling on this, and the first thing that comes to mind is to try to
get you on Accenture's Innovation Decoded podcast. I host it and they're
writing all the episodes for this fall. Would that be something you'd be
interested in?

Otherwise, on the podcasting front I know an excellent resource for
corporate podcasts in Seattle, and have done a fair bit of it. Do you have
a client that'd be interested in producing a few as a test we could
collaborate on?

All best,
Josh
