You should come visit! We finally left NYC mid-June. We got to see Act One
up close and personal as we were living ten blocks from Elmherst Hospital,
the center of the pandemic at the time...

But now we're in Iceland, up north by Akureyri. Do you have EU or non-US
visas, or are you expecting travel to open back up? Either way, I'd
recommend you plan to be flexible and respond to the weather; if you rent a
car you can drive around the entire country in a day, so it's easy to get
to wherever suits you best, and at the moment at least airbnb's and hotels
are plentiful... And of course we're more than happy to recommend locations
you'd find interesting. Are you into hiking/hot springs/local culture,
or...?

Good to hear from you, and glad you're both doing well. Curious to hear
what you've been up to - still investing/advising?

All best,
Josh
