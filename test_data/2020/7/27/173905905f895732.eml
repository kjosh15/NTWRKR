If it is written such that each new user is subject to 20% commission for
one year and then 10% for the second year then we're happy. Our only
concern is that by increasing size previous users go back to 20% after
having been at 10% (or zero having used the platform for more than 2
years). Why don't you prepare a draft you're happy with and we can review?
That way we're not just shooting things past you hoping to hit the mark.


Let me know - excited to get this wrapped!
