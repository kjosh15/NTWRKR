My family and I just moved back to Iceland. We all have kennitala and
citizenship but have to wait six months for enrollment in the national
health insurance. Do you have an interim health insurance plan, and if so
how can I learn more about it, what does it cover (does it cover
Covid-related expenses, for example?), what are costs (for my wife and I
and our 4 and 7 year old sons) and what is required to enroll?

kv.,
Josh
