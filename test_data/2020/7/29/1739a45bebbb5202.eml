If you want a sense of urgency on this approach, check out this recently
published Atlantic Council report:
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and-=
security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/breaking-trust/

The SBOM recommendation in that report was spurred by a Department of
Commerce initiative IonChannel is co-leading, which the FDA used in their
regulatory guidance that Software Bills of Materials will be required as a
condition of FDA approval for medical devices. They're engaged with a
healthcare POC that has a lot of the big hospital systems - Mayo,
Cleveland, NY Presbyterian, Cedars Sinai, Sutters on down the line -
pulling SBOMs for devices from Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher etc., for
vulnerability management.

If Corning wants to loop into that group, and/or be an anchor for a similar
POC in manufacturing, the door is open.
