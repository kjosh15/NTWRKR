=E2=80=9CDancer. Somatic therapist. Mother. Step-mother. Wife. Sister.=E2=
=80=9D It has
taken me over four decades to put =E2=80=9Cdancer=E2=80=9D first. When desc=
ribing what I do
I=E2=80=99ve always put it at the very end. In actuality, dance is the only
consistent element of my education since before I can remember. And yet, I
have not had the courage to claim it as an identity. Why not? Because as a
cis-gendered white woman I have always wanted my work to appeal to the
male-white-supremacist systems of higher education, of scholarly
intelligence, of tangibility, of product...wanted validation of my
skills/experience=E2=80=A6the same systems that flattened any non-verbal ed=
ucation
as non-essential/not useful. (ref @katieworkumdance
<https://www.instagram.com/katieworkumdance/> ) Dance is a non-verbal form.
To transform dance (ie. bodies in relationship to time and space, ref
@el_cuyjet <https://www.instagram.com/el_cuyjet/> ) into language is to
lose the form. When written down it becomes some thing else. To ask a
dancer to provide something tangible to account for the endless hours and
hours of time spent deeply engaged in research, in experiential learning is
like asking an author to dance their book out for it to be deemed
=E2=80=9Cimportant work=E2=80=9D and subsequently legitimized by our cultur=
e. The reality
is, if you count the hours of a dancer=E2=80=99s research, effort, skill bu=
ilding
and effort it would account for multiple PhD=E2=80=98s. A performance is on=
ly a
glimmer of years and years of work, it lasts about 90 minutes, and then it
is gone, and those dancers go back again the next day to a space where they
investigate their own patterns, impulses, vulnerabilities, trauma,
pathways, strengths, intimacy, blocks and then work with their own bodily
experience and other bodies to uncover deeper truths about being human.
While what I do has always been devoted to understanding how we live with
and through our bodies, and while that passion has been my life fire, I
have nothing to show for it. Only admitting who I am in the world can bring
regard to the incomprehensible depth of learning dance has brought me. To
authentically say I am a dancer first, is me claiming my 40+ years of
body-centered education as also valuable, so that I may bring that same
regard to other=E2=80=99s people=E2=80=99s valuable, non-verbal education.
