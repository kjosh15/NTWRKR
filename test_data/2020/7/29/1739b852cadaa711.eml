Nice to meet you too! Here's our situation:

We recently moved to Iceland and established residency; our whole family
have kennital and citizenship. We're waiting until the new year to decide
what to do next (for a variety of reasons!), but expect to be here at least
until January.

My work is all contract, and all virtual, and I'm in the process of
negotiating several contracts from a variety of parties in locations
ranging from Texas to Japan (mostly US, no EU.) Because of the nature of
the work, some of these contracts may be one-time payments of large lump
sums, some may be regular monthly checks. Overall income can vary greatly
as well, with annual income ranging from 1-300k USD, and I advise a couple
startups that may have exits in the next couple years.

I have a USA LLC I normally use to process all income, but recognize that
may not be most suitable given that ultimately I may be tax liable in
Iceland. Normally I would pay myself a small stipend from the US account
and deduct almost everything else as a business expense, but if we stay
longer than six months I'm not sure what works best. What do you suggest,
and/or can I supply more info?

Many many thanks,
Josh
