Below again. If you want this resolved quickly it might be worthy checking
in with one of the firms in Iceland - grant Thornton in Iceland - small
office of 31 but should have the know how and quick answers.

They might also have more updated know how of what the system looks like
now and if there are any changes to the system I'm not aware of!

create a class of people who were able to earn through Ltd and minimize tax
