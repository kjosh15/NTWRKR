Very cool! Would be curious to get your take on what VC is doing these
days; most of my purview is in C-suite execs on multinationals, where
there's way more inertia and tech debt driving decisions.

Keep me posted on if/when you're heading this way; would be more than happy
to help however I can!

All best,
Josh
