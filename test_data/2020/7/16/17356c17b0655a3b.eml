Thanks so much for this! I passed these on and they're apparently now very
bullish - esp. about the quarantine b license element (which I can't find
any details about)! The producer (Laura Rister) wants to talk to me, and
Rupert suggested I get a co-producer title. As ever with these things talk
is cheap, but so far so good; if the call goes well I'll revert to you as
you actually ARE a producer and perhaps you can give me a reality check.

More soon and many thanks,
Josh
