I enjoyed the conversation as well; in too much of the consulting work I've
done there's a heavy emphasis on enthusiasm and hand waving, and far too
little focus on identification of implementable opportunity and actual
execution.

In terms of ideas, I got to do a TV series for National Geographic some
years ago called The Link, all about the history of world-changing ideas.
While it lacked the depth of the work you've done by a wide margin it was a
great chance to spend a year digging into how ideas evolved over time, and
included a ton of awesome adventures - we got to walk around the TerraCotta
Warriors in China, rappel down Vesuvius, work in an actual Italian textile
mill where the first punchcards were used, and many more. Would love to
compare notes sometime as the tactile experience of all these locations and
inventions really drove home that innovation is messy, dirty, and immediate
- elements which have strong parallels even in digital innovation. If
nothing else, I'd add my support to your thesis that continuity and insight
are required components to successful innovation!

I'll give some more thought to potential engagement formats and questions
to be answered over the weekend - looking forward to seeing what we can
come up with.

All best,
Josh
