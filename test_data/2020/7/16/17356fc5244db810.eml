We're in Iceland for an uncertain duration; our kids' school is looking
like it'll go full virtual, so that opens things up a lot. I have Icelandic
citizenship, so we can travel in the EU: I'm pushing for winter in Spain so
we can improve our spanish. We'll see if/when/how we return to NYC...

OTOH, Covid decimated my pipeline for the entire year so far, so there's a
lot of backlog to make up for. Execs are finally starting to get interested
in innovation again so hopefully we'll lock something down soon.

Glad to hear you found something interesting to sink your teeth into; do
you have any plans to work with a firm as you bone up on all the
tech/strategy of investing? Otherwise curious to see how your trading goes
- looking forward to hearing about your wild success!!
