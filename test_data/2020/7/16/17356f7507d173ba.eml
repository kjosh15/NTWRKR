Good to hear from you!! And especially glad to hear you found a good place
to be at - as you noted, it's an interesting time for InVision's space
right now. You definitely landed on your feet after Samsung!

Covid knocked out a ton of opportunities, but also gave a massive boost to
a startup I've been working on measuring behavior and belief in employees.
It's proved to be extremely useful for remote workers who need to know
where they stand in terms of their teams, and an enormous boost to
executives looking to sustain and develop their corporate culture during
this critical time. It's also especially good at measuring bias - so the
BLM movement has also sparked a lot of interest. As a result we've been
growing our customer base extremely fast.

As that's gotten under control (it's a whitelabeled SaaS platform, so SOC2
compliance was the only real hurdle to growth) I've just in the last couple
weeks seen leaders start to evince a big appetite for innovation. I've got
more projects on the table than I could possibly address, and am trying to
figure out where to focus my efforts. Most interesting is a potential
healthtech effort that has UX/UI as a major component. It may be ancillary,
but I'd be curious to get your take if you think InVision is looking to
prompt growth in the healthcare space!

Let me know if you're up for a brief conversation,
Josh
