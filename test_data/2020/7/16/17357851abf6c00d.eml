The changes BSS made to the contract all look fine to me - but legalese
isn't a speciality. Are you ok w/ our declaring it good enough to sign in
today's call, did you have changes to make, or did you want to run it by a
lawyer?

FWIW, their clause of 100 hours seems fine to me as it essentially says
that if they go over those hours we'll need to renegotiate. I'd like to
clarify today that what we need up front is some basic collateral, and then
conversations ongoing about shaping the pitch as we bring it to further
clients. For example, I have a call next week with the CHRO of Halma, and
then also with the CTO of Motorola - both invitations that came
unsolicited. Either could end up being BSS clients as well.

Let me know if you object,
