Hrei=C3=B0ar,

I forwarded your info to Adam; I hope it works out!

At present it's looking likely that we'll stay in Iceland at least through
the new year. We'd like to establish residency and are exploring schools;
in the short term we don't know if listing residence as my brother-in-law's
basement apartment in Akureyri will present risk to him. It's fully
furnished (bathroom, kitchen, etc.) but I know there are limits to the
number of adults that can claim an address as residence.

Would that - along with any questions about enrolling the kids in a school
near Fjnoskadalur or in Akureyri - be within your remit, and if so at what
cost?

Many thanks,
Josh
