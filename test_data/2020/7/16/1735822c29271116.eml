Please let me know when you/your team would be available for a walkthrough.
There are numerous ways in which I could see our data being useful for the
services you're developing, and to be honest I'd be very curious to hear
how your staff would find new ways to use the platform. Velocity of change
at an individual and group levels is an interesting one, for example,
especially in terms of the cognitive models you described.

Looking forward,
Josh
