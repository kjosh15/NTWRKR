Subject: Potential tech for conversation with Lululemon CTO

Josh,
Reaching out to you on my personal email since this subject matter is
outside of AD.

My wife Bridget has a product line through her company Dual Citizen that I
think is relevant to Lululemon for reopenings of retail stores.
www.rae254.squarespace.com

This is a venture she began prior to COVID and has done everything from
filing IP to licensing relationships with retail fixturing companies.
Using UVC light (@ 254 wavelength) to sanitize apparel items.  The market
approach is consumer confidence. For example a customer at Lululemon wants
to try on an item, the Rae254 cabinet is near the fitting rooms, the
associate places the item for sanitation into the cabinet for 20-30
seconds. The consumer can then proceed with confidence that anything on the
item has been UVC cleaned.

Great stuff... through partnerships it is ready for the market.
 I thought it was a good fit for your meeting with LuluLemon. Happy to put
you in touch if you are interested in some of the more technical details of
the light source and why it is effective and what retailers get for a
product.

Frederick
