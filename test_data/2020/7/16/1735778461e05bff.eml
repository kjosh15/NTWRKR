Here is a link to quarantine exceptions in Icelandic and attached is the
form that would need to be filled out. We have US productions in the
country currently that have passed the requirements for this so I am
confident this would apply for you as well:

https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/greinar/grein/item41236/hverjir-get=
a-fengid-undanthagu-fra-sottkvi

Probably want to Google Translate that. Gist of it is you need to
quarantine everyone together while working. Lots of empty resorts and
hotels right now so shouldn't be a problem.
