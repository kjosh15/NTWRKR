Good call w/ Mike just now. Can you send them the list of benefits to the
platform along with the case studies you pulled together? They're going to
send us times that work for them to connect w/ Sarah and Harry (and
whomever else), and we can use that as a lead-in to starting their pilot
v.1 w/ their leadership team. I'm assuming we're close to being able to
pull the trigger on that - can it be a VM instance?

Finally, I really liked his suggestion about a list of friendlies to
approach with a press release. I'll have a think on making a list of
companies that passed that we could circle back around to - any thoughts
off the top of your head on who else should be on it?
