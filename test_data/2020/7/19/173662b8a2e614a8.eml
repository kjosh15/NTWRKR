Bill, Mark,

Thanks for the call last week; lots to think about! Your focus on executing
high-impact solutions which strongly leverage industry insider insight
strikes me as very well placed. Even moreso given the worldwide trends
we're seeing in the wake of the pandemic!

In terms of structure, I would suggest two simultaneous tracks:


1. Test currently identified opportunity spaces (Wireless Energy and
Blockchain)

a. vet same for feasibility, execution requirements, and anticipated ROI
b. design tests to validate assumptions about same
c. contract short-term resources to generate validation / learning
d. assist in managing initial tests, assessing results, and proposing next
steps (kill/test/re-invest).

The goal here is to get USDG moving fast, early, and ahead of any
competition. Note I have access to several potential development resources,
if needed.


2. Generate capacity for identifying opportunities ongoing

a. audit USDG's current assets, capabilities, and relationships
b. identify additional innovation opportunities
c. build resources to support ongoing innovation as backed by results
d. create "roulette board" of innovation options to allow for iterative
review and opportunistic partnerships/development in response to market
changes.

The purpose here is to generate a nuanced map of USDG's toolset and
potential high-leverage targets, as well as to fill any gaps in creating
and developing innovation ongoing.


These two tracks can happen in parallel, with cost/results indicating
best-fit solutions for longer term resourcing.

In terms of format, I'd suggest a part time retainer for one year to get
the above achieved, after which we could shift hours as needed. This means
that if we need a bigger push up front to support testing / asset mapping
we can ramp up accordingly. Similarly, if capacity building proceeds faster
than anticipated we can walk back to prevent unnecessary spend.

The above is just some initial thinking - let me know if you think this is
in line with your understanding of what USDG needs and we can discuss
further Tuesday!

All best,
Josh

P.S. Separately, Mark mentioned culture building around innovation. As this
is additive to the discussion we three had I didn't include it here, but
have plenty to add on the topic if it's relevant. Let me know if we should
include it on our list to cover!
