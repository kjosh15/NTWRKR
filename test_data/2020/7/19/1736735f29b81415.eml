Hi josh,

Sorry for the delay. Hot summer day wiped my out by evening!

Here is the link to the google doc letter we are preparing for Josh S to con=
sider.

Our basic premises are that
1. we want to be organized by September to face multiple covid risk scenario=
s
2. We don=E2=80=99t want to have to do parent-child lead virtual learning un=
less it is our only last/worse option (it is determined completely unsafe to=
 interact with anyone -a la spring 2020)
3. We want to create a structure that will allow EB admin/teachers to focus o=
n fewer students and perhaps those most in need to social/family support dur=
ing covid

And thus we are proposing an EB satellite for the 30-40% of students who are=
 from queens. This is a version of podding but one that is done thoughtfully=
 and will support and endorsement from the school. We would like some resour=
ces (a teacher or two, some curriculum support) but don=E2=80=99t want to as=
k for any resource that would make the rest of the school receive less than w=
hat the current offer is. We actually think this model will allow other non-=
queens kids to go to school more days and with less risk to those students a=
nd the teachers and staff at EB main campus.

I hope all of this is clear in the letter but if not, please let us know.

I don=E2=80=99t know what your relationship w Josh S is, but If you speak wi=
th him regularly or it wouldn=E2=80=99t be awkward if you could chat with hi=
m about some of our ideas on Monday that would be a great precursor to us se=
nding the letter. Or, what do you suggest? Finish the letter, send it and th=
en you speak with him? We=E2=80=99ve been advised to avoid a big multi-famil=
y meeting with him on this until he=E2=80=99s had a chance to think through s=
ome of these ideas.

I=E2=80=99m also working on a UFT/teacher perspective addendum if that seems=
 to be the biggest barrier to making this happen.

Happy to chat if you=E2=80=99d like!

Thanks so much,
Mandy
