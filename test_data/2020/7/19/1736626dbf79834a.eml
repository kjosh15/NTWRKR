Excellent! Lots of points to circle back to here - and looking forward to
reviewing your dissertation!

I'll send a brief structural suggestion to Bill and yourself shortly;
really curious to hear more about the cultural element as I've spent a fair
bit of time digging into this over the last couple years, specifically
around innovation. Could be an interesting challenge for USDG; my biggest
question on your mission statement is about the specific core values you're
trying to elevate.

More Tuesday,
Josh

P.S. +1 on the North - lots to compare notes on here!!

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I enjoyed the conversation as well; in too much of t=
he consulting work I&#39;ve done there&#39;s a heavy emphasis on enthusiasm=
 and hand waving, and far too little focus on identification of implementab=
le opportunity and actual execution.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In terms of ideas, I got to do a TV series for Natio=
nal Geographic some years ago called The Link, all about the history of wor=
ld-changing ideas. While it lacked the depth of the work you&#39;ve done by=
 a wide margin it was a great chance to
 spend a year digging into how ideas evolved over time, and included a ton =
of awesome adventures - we got to walk around the TerraCotta Warriors in Ch=
ina, rappel down Vesuvius, work in an actual Italian textile mill where the=
 first punchcards were used, and
 many more. Would love to compare notes sometime as the tactile experience =
of all these locations and inventions really drove home that innovation is =
messy, dirty, and immediate - elements which have strong parallels even in =
digital innovation. If nothing else,
 I&#39;d add my support to your thesis that continuity and insight are requ=
ired components to successful innovation!<u></u><u></u></p>
