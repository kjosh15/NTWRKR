Even with design;

Instagram layout in a few words:

https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304?s=20


- so here?s my take:

1. This isn?t a definitional challenge to coding, there are any number of
interpretations of that word and it can be argued both ways. The point is
this is an unprecedented level of abstraction not seen before.

2. We?re witnessing just the start, it?s going to get more sophisticated.
For now it replaces scaffolds, boiler plates but it learns and retains
without human intervention.

3. Which means there will be job displacement in tech- which isn?t bad,
just a little ironic.  And I believe it?s okay to know what that feels
like, for a change

4. This could arguably, be good in a lot of ways. More specifically,
democratisation of web and web services. My parents generation and my
daughter?s (when she learns to type) could get a webpage up in minutes.

And that?s not a bad thing.

Osama, I totally understand the spirit of your point about tools like
Debuild potentially democratising practices that you could argue are
"gatekept" behind technical knowhow and experience, and I agree there are
definitely exciting and stimulating aspects to all of this (did my thesis
largely on GPT-2), I just think by now it's fair and not overly cynical to
critically think over - whenever a San Francisco-based VC unveils a
product/service with seemingly "democratic" potential - whether or not said
product/service will actually be most successful in concentrating wealth in
the hands of still fewer and fewer people, along with eroding job security
and labor relations in the long term.

Hey list,

Wonderville <https://www.wonderville.nyc/> is an independent arcade and
event space in Brooklyn. The indoor space is currently closed due to COVID,
so we are looking to install some hands-free games or installations for our
front window to engage folks in our outdoor space.

We have monitors, computers, Kinects, and webcams, so you most likely
wouldn't need to provide hardware (unless you've got something custom).

Please contact mark@wonderville.nyc if you have something you'd like to
show! Potentially this can turn into a rotating gallery space once things
begin to open up more.

Thanks!

I think you?re right.

The last part of Turings quote posted by Amos made me think of FB types:

? In that case they would surround the whole of their work with mystery and
make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish, whenever any dangerous
suggestions were made.?

If Debuild turns into FB type mafia we all lose out. I was and rather still
am very excited about the underlying technology (GPT).

I'm taking parental leave for the fall semester and looking for someone to teach my "Interactive Project Design" class at FIT remotely on Wednesday nights 5:10-9pm EST starting in late August.

The department is a wild meat grinder of 3D Animation, Interactive Design and Game Design but of the students have an illustration background and an interest in using their 3D animation skills with VR/AR and game design.  I've taught this class for 6 years and have been focused on teaching game design with Unreal / Unity more than anything else because of student interests.  It is the students senior year so they are beginning to think about their capstone thesis project which is usually either a 3D animation or a game.  If you are interested give me a holler off list and we can talk more - my chair wants me to curate a list of 2 or 3 names to pass to them.

Teaching or professional experience required.

The entire Turing speech <http://www.vordenker.de/downloads/turing-vorlesung.pdf> that quote came from is a good read (you can skip the math/technical stuff and not miss much).  He goes into AI and the role of humans in the process.  In 1947, he would probably have been the only programmer in the world in the contemporary sense of the term.

But even some of these conveniences come with hidden costs, and will eventually (providing the thing you're working on needs to scale, isn't just a demo or toy proj) require experienced intervention. Even something like state management - exhibited in Debuild's short demo - can be pretty fraught, since React's in-house solution for it (Context/useContext) will cause re-renders to every consumer owing to the way its selectors and tracking works. There will always (or for some time, anyway) be a need for experienced debugging and understanding how to work with things at scale, especially in such a complex and dynamic ecosystem as development for the web.

Probably a more apt label for the VCs/angel investors/the like who are no doubt eagerly filling Debuild's creator's inbox to the brim right now.

If it catches on, people will specialize in it and the discipline of programming will evolve ? like how it evolved when compiled languages made it easier to write assembly code. But it won?t go away.

Good reminders that this a VC thing and should be treated with certain skepticisms. They?re going to need to find a business model?

That said, I wonder if the concept is powerful enough if you might see actual FOSS implementations.

And I wonder who is actually going to wind up using this. At least in the near term and not in the sci-fi ?the computer reads my dreams and I wake up to my brand new perfect web app? future. I?m going to guess pretty simple stuff. And they?ll probably have a bunch of pre-canned components for stuff people ask for a lot. ?Make me a blog with comments and a calendar of events on the side and a form at the top people can use to sign up for my newsletter.? ?Make me a storefront with products from [db here] and make it fancy.? Could be great for that kind of stuff! But that really starts to drift into ?What makes this better than SquareSpace?? territory pretty quickly.

The i-a "ITP-Alumni" discord has just a few alumni. I'm active mostly on
"Air To All" #model-b-cuirass that evolved out of my joining "Help With
Covid" - - Is anyone else playing/using discord? With what? And why?

We set up a Discord for Wonderville when the bar closed so we could host
virtual events. I prefer it as a "digital venue" because you can have group
voice chats, different permissions, and roles so certain people can only
post in certain channels. For archiving and organizing, I think Slack is
probably better. Depends on what you're trying to do. Feel free to DM if
you have more questions!
