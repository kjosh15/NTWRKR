super interesting updates! so glad to hear about this turn of events for
you.
I can't say that I have a good enough grasp yet around InVision's areas of
focus, but I'm happy to chat more.
I am running a research study in the coming 2 weeks (actually, I'm looking
for developers who work in medium / large companies to interview, if you
know of anyone). So perhaps in early August?

I'm attaching a little blurb about my research in case you have anyone in
mind to share it with:
We are looking for writers, developers, researchers, product managers and
executives who are involved in digital product design for a research study
we are doing at InVision.
This will be a paid 1.5h zoom interview (compensation is $100 giftcards),
about your work processes and collaboration, and will really impact how we
shape the future of our products (to better serve you).
If you are interested, please fill in this screener: https://lnkd.in/e9UT45=
S

Enjoy your weekend!
Nili
