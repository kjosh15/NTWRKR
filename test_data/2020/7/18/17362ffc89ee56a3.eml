Understood - thanks!

We made it to Iceland, and are coming to grips that we may not come back.
The really hard part is that our neighborhood in Queens was extraordinary,
and we're loath to leave it ... and ditto for my kid's school. That last
part is the really tough one.

That said, we're safe and sound in Iceland at the moment, which is a
blessing, and should be able to simply enroll them directly in the local
school system while getting local insurance, etc. (Which will cost a
shocking $800 for the family ... for the next six months. After which it's
free. And superior to the private insurance we had in the US.) With luck
we'll have more inflows by this winter and can relocate to Berlin (our next
choice after NYC.)

What about you? Do you have a Plan B? How's Seattle?

All best,
Josh
