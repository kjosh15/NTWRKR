Good to hear from you! I just visited my office yesterday for the first
time since March 11, and it did not smell as bad as expected. It's an
interesting time for universities, as major plans can shift pretty abruptly
overnight, and we have little idea if 90% of students will return, or 10%.
My role as associate dean ended after 3 years, and not a moment too soon. I
am NOT built to be a supervisor. The coming year will be a sabbatical at
Stanford, at this cool place <https://casbs.stanford.edu/>. I will be
writing a book with the working power "Corporate power in the 21st century,
and how to smash it." I came to a realization in the shower one day that
the underlying theme of my work is how ICTs change the conditions of
possibility for corporations. Here's the book idea:
"Corporations rely on markets for capital, supplies, and labor, and a
rule-bound market to sell things. ICTs have changed all of these, often by
making them more market-like: financialization, Nikefication, Uberization,
Amazonification. This makes the tools we used to tame corporations in the
20th century (e.g., antitrust, Wagner Act, Glass-Steagall) a poor fit with
the sources of corporate power today. The new corporate power is rooted in
ICTs and benefits particular kinds of corporations, which don't look much
like their predecessors. So, we need a new theory of corporate power and a
new set of tools to make the new kinds of corporations behave themselves in
service of human needs."
That's the project for the next year (and beyond, I imagine).
How are you?
