Barri,

1. Congratulations!! Now is a time of transformation, globally. Wonderful
to hear you're taking the time needed to chart a considered course forward
within that.
2. Did you want to do that lunch/coffee/whatever (virtually, of course)
that we talked about way back when Haakon was on his way?

All best wishes,
Josh

Dear All,

We, Barri and Kristen, have made the hard and joyous decision to take some
personal time off and therefore will not be seeing clients in 2021.

As we have shared with many of you, last year each of us started thinking
about what we might create in this next time in our lives with our children
grown but while we are both healthy and energized. Each of us finds it hard
to articulate exactly where we are going as we have some ideas of how we
would like to work for the greater good outside of midwifery, or, in a
different way in maternal child family health, but do not yet know where
the road will take us. What we do know is that walking down that road
requires more time and focus than each of us has while simultaneously
running a home birth practice and all of the surrender that that requires.
We have both spent the majority of our adult lives being on call for others
and we are privileged, even if the projects will be in the spirit of
restorative and hopefully transformative justice, to be able to take a year
off and listen to and refine our own calling.

We are already starting to redirect our clients to other midwives in our
home birth community and we are emboldened to take this step knowing there
is such a wonderful and growing community of midwives offering stellar care
to clients at home.

We look forward to your questions, congratulations and replies but we ask
you to understand, with this email going out to our entire community, that
we will not be able to reply to everyone quickly.

Although beginning in January 2021 we will not be immediately available for
care, we will still be monitoring email and you will still have access to
your charts through Maternity Neighborhood.

We will update you as our plans evolve.

Every one of you has added to the knowledge and joy in our professional
lives. We could not have done this without you.

Much love,
Barri and Kristen
