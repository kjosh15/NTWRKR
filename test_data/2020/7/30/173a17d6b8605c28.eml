What do you think about ordering the following to have shipped to our US
address, and then to us in Iceland among our clothes and such?

laptop covers (O and J)
kindle
fitbit for Josh
suppliments
new airpods (Josh gets new ones, Hulda gets old ones for running?)
socks
rain pants
warmer pants
hiking pants (Fjallraven US will honor their discount price to me now that
I know size)
contacts
winter shoes (vivo barefoot?)
full-spectrum bulbs/sunlamp?

Do you already have a list like this we can collaborate on?

Xoxo,
Josh
