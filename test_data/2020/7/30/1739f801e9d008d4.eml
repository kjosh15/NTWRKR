You've moved us twice now; we're currently in Iceland and not sure when
we're coming back. Can you pack up our place sans furniture, and / or do
you have a storage service you'd recommend if we end up taking an extended
sabbatical?

Very much obliged - we hope you and yours are safe and healthy!

All best,
Josh
