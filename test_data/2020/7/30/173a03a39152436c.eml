The 2-ish year cliffs were what we'd discussed at length so far; I'm loath
to start over in hashing through a perpetuity clause.

As for the trial period yes, I think 2.1(c) covers it.

I've cc'd my partner, Chris, in case he disagrees, but otherwise think we
should be able to move forward with what we have as long as Michael is
comfortable.

Thanks,
Josh
