We need to get our two cats from NYC to my sister in Seattle. Do you or is
someone you know traveling/want to travel LGA > SEA? We would need two
people to go and can cover the cost of one ticket + the cost of having the
cats fly under your seats. We're looking at the last week of August/first
week of Sept. Any suggestions are welcome!

Many thanks,
Josh
