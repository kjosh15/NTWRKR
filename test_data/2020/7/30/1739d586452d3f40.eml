Hi Josh and Everyone,=20
I'm trying to find the links I posted for the files (with the 'dark file'=
=20
broken down into 3 files). I can't locate it. It's buried in the thread=20
somewhere.   Can someone please post a link on the Crowbox page or in a=20
sticky with the ponoko files linked? Otherwise everyone who tries to order=
=20
from Ponoko will have this problem.=20

Also, Consider contacting the guy in Seattle as well as Tapp Plastics. It=
=20
might be a good idea to research the combo price further on getting Tapp=20
Plastics and ordering from the Seattle guy I mentioned in a thread.

Sorry for going dark. We are planning to build our CBs in August with the=
=20
nephews. I'll be reviewing the parts list this week and will start=20
uploading pics of the build etc.=20
