The nitty gritty is so fun though.....

Just thinking this over some more before I pass some language by you on the
20/10% stuff.  Would be it be easier to have a perpetuity clause instead of
the two-ish year cliffs?

Also, I know there was a trial-period (for potential customers) convo
between you and Michael.  Do you think this is this covered by 2.1(c) -
demonstrating the Product to any potential customer?

Tks
