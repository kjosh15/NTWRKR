Do you know anyone who is traveling/wants to travel LGA > SEA? We would
need two people to go and can cover the cost of one ticket + the cost of
having the cats fly under their seats. Would want them to go last week of
August/first week of Sept.  Turns out that flying people with the cats is
cheaper (and nicer for the cats - cargo holds are no fun) than using
shipping companies. Any suggestions are welcome!

Many, many thanks!
Josh
