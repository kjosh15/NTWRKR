Just pushed them for feedback. We'll see what they say.

Thanks for the intro to Gu=C3=B0n=C3=BD, BTW! Really hopeful for help - int=
ernational
tax law is doing my head in.

Separately, I talked to my old friend Toshi
<https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654729/> today and realized he's a pretty
well known DP. Turns out he's interested in working on documentaries also,
so if you have a need (he apparently has some name value) let me know if I
can intro!

Looking forward to =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur,
Josh
