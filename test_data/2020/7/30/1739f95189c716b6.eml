We need to get our two cats from NYC to my sister in Seattle. Do you know
anyone who is traveling/wants to travel LGA > SEA? We would need two people
to go and can cover the cost of one ticket + the cost of having the cats
fly under their seats. Would want them to go last week of August/first week
of Sept. Any suggestions are welcome!

Many thanks,
Josh
