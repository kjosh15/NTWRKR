This is extremely confusing; it's the middle of a pandemic, how can
COVID-19 not be covered? It seems completely intolerable to buy insurance
that doesn't cover one of the biggest risks present right now.

I would very much appreciate any suggestions you can make; right now we're
paying 304,290.00 ISK/month for insurance from the USA which covers the
same things as your plan - plus Covid.

kv.,
Josh
