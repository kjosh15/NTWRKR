Thanks!! Here's some answers:

We are at 33-53 82nd st, on the top (4th) floor of a walk up. We're not
looking at moving out (yet), but are in the middle of a challenging lease
renegotiation and want to be ready if things go bad this fall. Either way,
we'd want to move everything *except* for the furniture into storage.

Once it's in storage we'd want to keep it there for 6 months to a year
while we get set up somewhere else, and then have it shipped to us (likely
by boat as that'd be cheaper). So having weight and size estimates would be
very helpful.

The items we'd be storing would mostly be household goods, papers, books,
kitchen tools, etc. No clothes (we're in Iceland and are already arranging
to ship them over here), and again no furniture so nothing to disassemble.
No need for temp control. There are some delicate keepsakes (a glass swan,
an old wooden babushka, etc.) but nothing extraordinarily valuable.

We can provide pictures of each room, but wanted to get a rough idea of
what the packing/moving costs might possibly be (given that there's no
furniture) + understand the storage costs and if you can manage shipping
from the storage location to Europe.

Finally, what is a Certificate of insurance?

Thank you so so much!!
Josh
