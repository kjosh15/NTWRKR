Thanks, I'll check it out! Really appreciate the encouragement.

Hulda was definitely a fan, and the loaf didn't make it past lunch so it
seems it was well received. My next big question is if I can get the
process to be intuitive enough that the cognitive overhead is less.
Breaking every 30m to do a stretch and fold, re-analyze the process, prep
stuff, etc. didn't help my work output any, but I get the impression that
it all could become background after a few rounds. Any thoughts?

Love,
Josh
