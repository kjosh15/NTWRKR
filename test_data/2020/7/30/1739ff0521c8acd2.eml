Firstly, I did some more digging, and it looks like if you receive an EIDL
advance AND a PPP loan, proceeds from the advance will be deducted from the
loan forgiveness amount. In other words, I'm better off leaving the EIDL
until I need a low-interest loan I intend to repay, instead of looking to
it as free money, especially if I'm only eligble for $1k. Let me know if
you know better.

Secondly, it appears that I can claim unemployment AFTER the period the PPP
loan applies for. I'm still not clear if that is 8 weeks or 12 weeks; the
former was true when I applied, the latter seems true now. Either way, can
you confirm that I'm eligible as that might be a more flexible source of
gov't funding until I secure more contracts? (FWIW, I'm negotiating two
contracts now, but you know how the freelance life goes. Better to be
prepared!)

Finally, I'm looking into advice on how to handle taxes here in Iceland as
we've established residency locally. So far the best advice is to make an
LLC locally, but I'm not sure how to manage where income should arrive
and/or be paid out. Do you have any experience / advice on this front?

Hope you and yours are well,
Josh

P.S. Are you looking for more customers? We have a couple friends who are
also freelance and are enjoying a boom in business thanks to the pandemic.
Let me know if we should point them to you!
