Hi Josh,

First, I'm not 100% sure about the rules with regard to lease renewal for
market rate apartments. I believe it's usually whatever it says in the
lease. If you are in a rent stabilized apartment, you MUST be offered a
lease renewal no less than 90 days before the end of your lease and this
year they may not raise the rent at all on a one-year lease, and only by 1%
on a two-year lease. However this is ONLY if you are rent-stabilized.
Market-rate apartments can be denied lease renewals at any time.

However - if you are market rate and have asked for a renewal within the
time period specified in your lease, but have received no response,
continue to receive no response, and still want to live in the apartment,
you should continue to pay the same amount of rent after the end of the
lease. If management continues to accept this rent, you will automatically
become a month-to-month tenant. Note that this is ONLY if you receive no
response.

Most importantly - we have had at least at least one tenant
successfully negotiate a lower rent upon lease renewal. They offered him
around $120 per month less, but we advised him to negotiate for more based
on the drop in price of listed apartments on Street Easy (one apartment
listed at $2700 was dropped to $2350). He eventually ended up with around
$240 per month less (down from something like $2950). So I would absolutely
recommend mentioning the drop in price in listings and the lowering of
rents for other tenants.

Thanks
Milo
