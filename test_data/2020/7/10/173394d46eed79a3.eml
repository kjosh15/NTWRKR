They are a kind of specialist infrastructure =E2=80=93 principally =
owning and operating rail terminals =E2=80=93 if I understand it =
correctly, the guys that run the railroads don=E2=80=99t always own the =
terminals =E2=80=93 mostly because they haven=E2=80=99t had the funds to =
build terminals recently =E2=80=93 particularly to support the recent =
increase in frack=E2=80=99d oil =E2=80=93 which often goes by rail =
rather than pipeline because of the diffuse nature of the resource and =
the difficulty in getting pipelines approved. So other companies raised =
funds, built them and now lease space back either to the railroad or the =
oil guys.

Safety is going to be massive for them =E2=80=93 so you could try the =
angle that safety protocol adherence is cultural and therefore they need =
to work on the cultural norms in their workers =E2=80=93 but their =
workforce will be very blue collar (more so than the oil guys I have =
worked with here) so advance tech could be a challenge.

Their Co-General Counsel and Secretary and their Chief Administrative =
Officer and Vice President, Environmental, Health & Safety want to do a =
call with me next week to talk about blockchain. And their future. And a =
project they may be working on.

Do you know wtf they do? They seem to think their website is wildly =
obvious and articulate, but I'm not clear on what "reliable midstream =
infrastructure" for "dynamic logistics" is. Any tips on what they do and =
thoughts on angles for pitching Indigo to them?
