Went through the site and it looks fabulous - clearly enormously polished.
That does make it a little harder to figure out where the weak links are,
however... To whit, the piece which made me squint my eyes a little bit was
"Our strategy links government-funded research to patient, risk-tolerant
capital so that more transformative clean energy innovations get to market
faster."

I.e., how much will your hands be tied by the gov't element, and can you at
least restrict this to the EU vs the EU + US?

Otherwise the remit looks amazing; are you looking at owning only one of
the five main categories?
