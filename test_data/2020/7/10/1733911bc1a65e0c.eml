You may have already been introduced, in which case consider this a
re-invitation.

Bala, Paul recently joined us in Iceland and is keen to understand the
community here better. I got the chance to do a bit of work with him at
IDEO last year and was blown away at both the scope of his vision and his
ability to land strategy and execution simultaneously.

Paul, Bala has been one of the keenest eyes on the Icelandic VC community
since I first discovered the country. I've been fortunate to be able to
exchange notes with him several times over the last few years and have
never failed to come away better educated.

Keep me posted with what you two come up with!

All best,
Josh
