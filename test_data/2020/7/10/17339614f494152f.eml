J=C3=B6rg,

So good to hear from you!! We made it to Iceland a couple weeks ago, thank
goodness. The sad part is that it now looks like we may need to stay - and
may not even be able to get back to move our stuff out/over/etc. Very
disruptive times.

On the upside, we're looking at Berlin as a possible next "home," which
would make us much more like neighbors than we have been to date. And also
means I'll be able to buy that dinner for you sooner!!! ;)

No promises, and everything is up in the air, of course, but I wanted to at
least toss it up as something we're considering. The fact that I have
Icelandic citizenship has opened a lot of doors.

Glad to hear you're all well and enjoying good weather, albeit with some
poor educational field system choices. Let me know if you'd like to set up
a call in the next few weeks to compare notes and catch up!

All best wishes to you and yours,
- J
