Here is a link for information about the incentives:

https://www.filminiceland.com/incentives/#:~:text=3DIncentives%20%2D%2025%2=
5%20Reimbursement&text=3DThe%20reimbursements%20from%20the%20State,and%20te=
levision%20programmes%20in%20Iceland.&text=3DPayments%20pertaining%20to%20e=
mployees%20and,are%20verifiably%20taxable%20in%20Iceland.

There is also a very skilled workforce here with lots of experience in the
film service industry, a good understanding of co-productions, and an
incredibly strong belief that everything can happen quickly and
efficiently. Icelanders get shit done, fast, and high quality generally.
The fact that so much filming has been done here (Game of Thrones, etc.)
means there is a ton of capacity as needed.

Does that help?

And I'll envoy the shit out of this if it gets ya'll over to celebrate
again!! ;)
