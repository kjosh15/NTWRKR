OK, am digging in now - you just need $$ incentives? Or do you also need
local crew/scouts/locations/permits/etc.?

Where are you guys these days? We made it to Iceland (obvs) and it's
disorienting: I was talking to a congressman friend of mine the other day
about how the virus hit the capital and he said "yeah, and then, after
covid..." That's def. the feeling here. It's crazy after NYC.

Hope you guys are well and sending lots of love your way. Will revert on
Iceland ASAP!!
