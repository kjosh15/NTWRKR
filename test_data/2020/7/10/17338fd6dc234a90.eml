That recruiter friend of mine, Allen, pitched us using the intro video to
JP Morgan. He was very politic, but when pressed his contact there flatly
refused to pitch it because the materials weren't professional enough. So.

Q: I'm still pushing BSS; do you think it puts us too much on the back foot
to suggest that we missed JP because we needed their help?

OTOH, I've been gently pinging the CTO of Motorola since November, when I
had a call with him about transforming the company culture towards lean. He
suggested:

"My team has built/hacked together a wellness-check app for the company (it
is a super simple questionnaire that allows an employee to request access
to the facility, answer some questions, and get a recommendation to either
come into the facility or stay at home). This app is now turning into a
data gathering mechanism to gather employee sentiment (do they want to work
from home, do they prefer to come into the office, do they feel anxious,
etc..). We are likely going to move into a majority-will-work-from-home
model going forward. I see many questions being asked about productivity,
etc.."

I'm waiting to schedule a call now.

Onward,
Josh
