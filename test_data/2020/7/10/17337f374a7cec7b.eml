Of course! I'm trying to get a more comprehensive list now; are you looking
mostly for $$ incentives? Or do you also need local
crew/scouts/locations/permits/etc.?

Hope you guys are doing well; the world is a much more interesting place
ATM and I'm stoked to see how we all take advantage of it!! Getting you
shooting in Iceland would be a nice first step!

All best,
Josh
