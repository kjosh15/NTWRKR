Their Co-General Counsel and Secretary and their Chief Administrative
Officer and Vice President, Environmental, Health & Safety want to do a
call with me next week to talk about blockchain. And their future. And a
project they may be working on.

Do you know wtf they do? They seem to think their website is wildly obvious
and articulate, but I'm not clear on what "reliable midstream
infrastructure" for "dynamic logistics" is. Any tips on what they do and
thoughts on angles for pitching Indigo to them?
