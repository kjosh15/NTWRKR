Got VM the last couple times I called so wanted to see how you're doing.

Also, my Mom had the idea that because we all can't travel I could record
your eulogy just in case. Doesn't get much more modern era than that! Let
me know what you think - obvs. I'm happy to come in person when we're able,
but you know how we like our contingency planning...

Otherwise the kids are doing great, running all over the place with lots of
time outside. We went camping last week and they loved it. Hulda is doing
well and we're both finding our feet here. Finally, I'm seeing some good
signs on the work front so fingers crossed - we're keeping the faith.

Sending lots and lots of love,
Josh
