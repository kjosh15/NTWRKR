That recruiter friend of mine, Allen, pitched us using the intro video =
to JP Morgan. He was very politic, but when pressed his contact there =
flatly refused to pitch it because the materials weren't professional =
enough. So.=20

=20

Q: I'm still pushing BSS; do you think it puts us too much on the back =
foot to suggest that we missed JP because we needed their help?

=20

OTOH, I've been gently pinging the CTO of Motorola since November, when =
I had a call with him about transforming the company culture towards =
lean. He suggested:

=20

"My team has built/hacked together a wellness-check app for the company =
(it is a super simple questionnaire that allows an employee to request =
access to the facility, answer some questions, and get a recommendation =
to either come into the facility or stay at home). This app is now =
turning into a data gathering mechanism to gather employee sentiment (do =
they want to work from home, do they prefer to come into the office, do =
they feel anxious, etc..). We are likely going to move into a =
majority-will-work-from-home model going forward. I see many questions =
being asked about productivity, etc.."

I'm waiting to schedule a call now.
