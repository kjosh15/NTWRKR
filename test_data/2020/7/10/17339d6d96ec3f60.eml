Can we push to own all the cyber risk ask defined by the SOC2 material
we=E2=80=99ve provided so far (abetted as much as possible by the AWS artif=
act
docs)? This shields is by letting us lean on Amazon.

I have several friends in the insurance industry I can ask for advice, but
otherwise not sure how much luck we=E2=80=99ll have - I wouldn=E2=80=99t ex=
pect Bechtel to
want to drop the liability. Is it time to make a base of opps in the US?
