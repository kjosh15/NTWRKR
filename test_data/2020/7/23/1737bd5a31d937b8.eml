pital, supplies, and labor, and a rule-bound market to sell things. ICTs ha=
ve changed all of these, often by making them more market-like: financializ=
ation, Nikefication, Uberization, Amazonification. This makes the tools we =
used to tame corporations in the 20th century (e.g., antitrust, Wagner Act,=
 Glass-Steagall) a poor fit with the sources of corporate power today. The =
new corporate power is rooted in ICTs and benefits particular kinds of corp=
orations, which don&#39;t look much like their predecessors. So, we need a =
new theory of corporate power and a new set of tools to make the new kinds =
of corporations behave themselves in service of human needs.&quot;</div><di=
