We're looking to ship some winter clothes, books, kids toys and some
kitchen items from NYC to Akureyri, Iceland, and have no idea what sort of
range exists for price/weight/times.

Ideally we'd ship things by the end of August and receive them by end of
September at the latest. We haven't started packing yet, so could really
use some guidance on potential pricing and times. I know we can ship by sea
or air, but don't know what to expect in terms of either.

Many thanks,
Josh
