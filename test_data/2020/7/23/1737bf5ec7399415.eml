these, often by making them more market-like: financialization, Nikeficatio=
n, Uberization, Amazonification. This makes the tools we used to tame corpo=
rations in the 20th century (e.g., antitrust, Wagner Act, Glass-Steagall) a=
 poor fit with the sources of corporate power today. The new corporate powe=
r is rooted in ICTs and benefits particular kinds of corporations, which do=
n&#39;t look much like their predecessors. So, we need a new theory of corp=
orate power and a new set of tools to make the new kinds of corporations be=
have themselves in service of human needs.&quot;</div><div>That&#39;s the p=
