Great news! Haven't done any mixed media panels, unfortunately, so can't
advise on that element. Otherwise I'm based in Akureyri - are there no
flights from there to =C3=8Dsafj=C3=B6r=C3=B0ur?

kv.,

so I have been contemplating what is the most appropriate format. Do you
perhaps have any experience with a panel which is part virtual and part in
person. Or actually if you will be in Reykjav=C3=ADk we can arrange a back =
and
forth flight on the 22nd.

you and and therefor I would like to ask wether you would be interested in
giving a speech at the forum.

are confirmed but not all of them. I put your name under the item
"Entrepreneurs and teaching", do you reckon that is the right spot?
