Mandy,

Had a good call w/ Betsy yesterday - Josh was out on Personal Development.
She was super responsive to the idea of working with parents, and hadn't
heard the rumor that fully remote kids would be assigned DOE teachers.
She thought that was super unlikely but was going to look into it. Finally,
she helped me understand that there are concerns about how EBS is striving
to support their teachers in providing equitable support to all their
families. For example, see this link that teachers were passing around
yesterday as food for thought:

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/opinion/pandemic-pods-schools.html?refer=
ringSource=3DarticleShare

I wasn't able to join the session with Josh last night so this info may be
out of date, but my impression is that EBS staff are trying to thread the
needle in keeping the equity and inclusion which is so critical right now
while also supporting all the different needs among their families. And
they're doing this while developing entirely new curriculums on totally new
technology platforms aiming at reopening targets that the DOE keeps
changing.

All that said, she was very happy to keep connecting and was really
grateful for the outreach. I think that as long as we keep approaching this
as parent's efforts to support and supplement their efforts EBS is more
than welcoming of the help.

One other thing we talked about was how EBS could best support parents in
this time of transition. I voiced that personally I suffered from not
knowing where to start in supporting my kids on basics like writing, and
she emphasized that they'd really like to find a way to provide that sort
of insight to parents when/where/how they needed it. This might be another
avenue for collaboration to make net positive benefit materials for the
whole school.

I'm still waiting to hear back from Josh and hope to have another meeting
with him next week. Let me know what you heard last night and what the
response was from parents!

Many thanks,
Josh
