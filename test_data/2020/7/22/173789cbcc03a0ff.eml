Had an entertaining and insightful conversation with Jared today; you work
with some interesting folks!! Def. saw alignment with values, and hopefully
also some skill set overlap and compliments.

We both thought that finding something to work together on would be the
right first step, but neither of us had anything on the table at the
moment.

Given your insight that =E2=80=9Clet=E2=80=99s hope something happens somet=
ime in the
future=E2=80=9D often doesn=E2=80=99t lead to much, can you think of anythi=
ng more active
we could do that would let us help each other and perhaps create an excuse
to collaborate?
