I like where you=E2=80=99re headed, but having run out of namespace before =
would
suggest a more scalable approach - I.e., Indigo_bechtel, or IM_Bechtel or
something similar where each instance inherits the name from the client
might be better. Less fun, but def. more scalable.

Just want to avoid having to tell a client that their instance is called
=E2=80=9Cpale_easter_pink=E2=80=9C or something...
