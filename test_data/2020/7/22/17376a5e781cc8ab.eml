# how to help your kids adjust to moving to a new country?
            ask school to intro us to families of kids in our kid's grades
            ask for intro to kid in their grade to act as ambassador
            that way boys know someone before first day
            could also have playdate before school starts
            takes edge off school element
            or schedule fun activity?
            do one kid for each, one kid at a time
            so it's all about them
            and/or
            have a BBQ for the families afterwards
> Other big thing is to get friends for Hulda: build community off of
school place to begin
            so get that off to good start!
            could have international day; set up food booths
            think of an angle for something fun
