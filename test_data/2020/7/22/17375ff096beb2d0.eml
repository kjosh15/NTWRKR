Do you have any examples of this diversity of feedback? Might be worth
highlighting as something to watch for in the next rollout. I.e., if we're
mostly surveying leaders we could provide some immediate value in
identifying who needs training, even if we don't provide said training.

If nothing else would be a good chance to highlight the *kinds* of added
value we can provide ongoing and to start a conversation about how to
operationalize based on the data we provide.

Any thoughts on the Canvas 8 idea?
