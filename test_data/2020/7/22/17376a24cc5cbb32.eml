Interesting! Reminds me that BP (I'm friends with their CTO and was
exploring a board position for their R&D arm when the oil collapse hit) has
been shedding jobs at a fast clip; there may be an opportunity to snap up
some excellent talent as a result. We should consider if it's worth asking
for introductions/recommendations.

Ditto on www.b-t.energy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Energy>
(Bezos', Gates, Ma, etc. etc.'s alternative energy investment vehicle); I
have a good friend who is in her third interview for CEO and would have an
excellent view on where the best talent/partnerships would be.
