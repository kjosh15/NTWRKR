What's really crazy is that in NYC our health insurance for four was $2,250
- and going up to $2,500 in the new year. Just unconscionable.

Bulgaria could be a good option; as you likely already know citizenship in
a Shengen member country gives you the whole EU package. I was a little
stunned to learn that once we have established citizenship here in Iceland
we can basically just move anywhere within Europe and health insurance
continues uninterrupted. No visas required, no pre-paperwork... just turn
up and rent a place. (And then of course jump through copious *local*
bureaucracy... but that's hardly insurmountable.)

As my perspective changes I'm being continually surprised at the level of
innovation actually extant in the EU, along with rational infrastructure.
It's not perfect (neonazis are top of mind here), but it delivers on so
much of the promise of the US as I'd long understood it that I find myself
frequently surprised. It's especially startling given that I've been here
1/4th of the year at least - and then mostly at conferences and events
focused on innovation.

Anyway, godspeed on Bulgarian citizenship; I unfortunately think you're
right that the political situation is likely to get worse before it gets
better. And that's before counting in the virus or the economic shocks. :/

Hope you and yours stay safe and healthy; keep me posted and let me know if
I can be of any help!
