Thanks Mark, really appreciate that! Agreed that I may be more useful to
you up front in producing a high level opinion reg. problems and
possibilities in your industry. However, that's more because digging into
that will let me give you better advice on where to target and how to
validate opportunities overall. Similarly, any specific projects are going
to require leaning heavily on your insider knowledge at least initially -
because that's USDG's competitive edge.

I'm working on a framework proposal now and am excited to see what we can
get going!! To that end it would be useful to hear your thoughts on budget
as that'll impact my overall time investment guidelines.

All best,
Josh
