Apologies for the slow response; we=E2=80=99re seeing a real uptick in larg=
e
corporate interest (which is good news!), but as a result the rest of this
week is now blocked out. Are there any days next week at 9 or 10am PST that
work for you?

I mentioned to Josh the other day the kind of stuff William is<br>
doing with The Worker Agency in bringing super high quality<br>
communications strategy to organizations that typically wouldn&#39;t<br>
communicate quite that well.<br>
<br>
Josh is involved in a psychometrics company that does stuff he<br>
can probably better explain than I could, but feels like the<br>
non-creepy, arm-the-resistence antidote to a world that&#39;s been<br>
fucked by Cambridge Analytica type stuff.<br>

I am almost certain that both of those intros are largely<br>

<br>
It does occur to me that it&#39;d be very nice to have a beer with<br>
both of you simultaneously. Maybe sometime!<br>
