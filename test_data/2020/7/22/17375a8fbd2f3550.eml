Hi there Amazing Gamers,

It's the Christmas in July sale at DriveThruRPG, which means you can get great discounts on the whole Amazing Tales range.

If you haven't picked up the core Amazing Tales book, [the PDF is available for just $4.47](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/222950/Amazing-Tales-complete-kids-RPG), and includes the rules, tons of advice, four settings, forty story seeds and one complete adventure.

If your adventurers are feeling ready for a whole campaign, check out The Quest for the Dragon Crown. The Kingdom of Merrydown is threatened by an army of invading dragons, and it will take real heroism to save it. [The Quest for the Dragon Crown is just $3.71](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/282325/The-Quest-for-the-Dragon-Crown).

Or if you'd sooner set sail for a campaign on the Pirate Seas take a look at Captain Cadava's Treasure. As they travel from the sunken taverns of Deeptown to the terrifying Dead Men's Sea, the search for the treasure of the long dead Spanish captain will challenge any pirate heroes brave enough to take it on. [Captain Cadava's Treasure is just $3.71](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/312002/Captain-Cadavas-Treasure).

If you're looking for something a little different for your games why not set your adventures in the thrilling, but non-violent Rescue City? This modern day setting features the kind of heroes you might meet any day just walking down the street, the fire-fighters, police officers and medics who protect the public. Rescue City is a setting for Amazing Tales, just like the four presented in the core book, and includes ten story seeds and one sample adventure - Parachute Pandemonium. [Rescue City is available for $2.24 while the sale lasts](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/280361/Rescue-City-An-Amazing-Tales-setting).

And if you're looking for something to keep the kids entertained through the summer, don't forget the [Amazing Tales Colouring Book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/254332/Amazing-Tales-Coloring-Book). Featuring all the art from the core rulebook the print and colour colouring book is just $1.46.

I hope you're having an amazing summer of gaming

All the best

Martin
