Let me know if tomorrow morning or morning the day after works to connect.
Been talking to my friend in LA who has two projects deciding where to
shoot right now. Because all new TV/Film projects are being designed to be
self-contained, they're looking for a good stage they can use; do you have
any idea what's available here in Iceland?

If we can find a good location that can serve these projects I'd like to
see if I can't connect with anyone in government to push for better tax
incentives - right now Ireland is offering 37% (vs Iceland at 25%). Not
having to quarantine for as long is obviously a cost savings, but US
Citizens still can't come, so it's a mixed bag, and I'd like to find a way
to sweeten the deal in attracting shoots.

Part of the thinking here is that in this new world order being able to
facilitate shoots that can be done despite the pandemic is going to be at a
premium, and we'd like to find a way to get a piece of that. Love your
thinking on any of the above!

All best,
Josh
