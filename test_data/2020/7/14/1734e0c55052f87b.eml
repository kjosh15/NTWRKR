Spoke to Aaron Hurst today; they're game for working with us, but see
themselves as doing much more of an intervention and then working with us
to validate their results. Notes below, but think we can use it as one more
service offering for clients looking for a new way to craft change.

best,
Josh

we would be the back end to their front end
we'd validate where/how the conversations and interventions they were
hosting were working
easy to integrate on their end; just give them the data
they can then figure out who/what from there
D&I a rich target
