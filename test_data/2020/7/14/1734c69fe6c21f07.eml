Hi Josh!

=20

Good morning and thank you for sharing your thoughts! Yes, if you are =
considering Berlin, housing is the aspect to be prepared for (duck - =
cover - hold on to) =E2=80=93 the real estate market has been going =
crazy for the last 15 years (maybe not compared to NYc standards?!), =
affordable housing for small incomes can only be found in the periphery, =
that is an hour or two away by subway/train from the center. I know that =
this does not sound intimidating to an American ear, but it tends to be =
rather rural out there with not as much intercultural competence among =
the native population as you might expect =E2=80=93 plus, I see you =
looking for a place in the *center* of things, right?!

=20

Now, that I come to think about it, I have another author and co-worker =
that I might want to recommend making contact with once you have a more =
detailed  vision of your future: Cecile Rossant is a writer and =
wonderful person who is originally from NYC, but has been living in =
Berlin for quite a while (mid 90s?!). She is partly of French decent as =
well - https://de-de.facebook.com/cecile.rossant

As I said: a wonderful and interesting person.

=20

So, you please keep popping up in my inbox! Much appreciated!

=20

And, yes, it would be wonderful to have a chat with you =E2=80=93 can I =
ask for another week or so, before we make it happen? We are right in =
the =E2=80=9Eend-of-the-school year=E2=80=9C-period, quite stressful =
=E2=80=A6 Let=E2=80=99s look into late July/early August, how about =
that?!

=20

Good thoughts

Betreff: Re: How are you?!

=20

Firstly, congratulations!!! It looks like you're in an amazingly =
beautiful space, and such a wonderful family. Josephine is so big now!!

=20

Secondly, I cannot thank you enough for your kind offer reg. Berlin. =
Right now we're very much in the air, with big questions about my work, =
my startup, the boys' school in NYC, the rate of infection, etc. etc. =
etc. all TBD. That said, please be ready for me to reappear in your =
inbox with a request for introductions - I'm quite keen to explore =
living in Berlin and as I understand it the housing component is perhaps =
the most complicated element.=20

=20

Regardless of all of the above let me know if you have time in the weeks =
ahead for a quick zoom just to catch up. On a purely personal level one =
of the biggest gifts of the pandemic is a reaffirmation of our intention =
to stay well connected with true friends, and I'd be keen to hear from =
you directly about how you got through these crazy last few months!

=20

With gratitude,

Josh

=20

P.S. I would be remiss not to answer Josephine's question (and thanks to =
her for asking!) The cats are being taken care of by a friend who is =
staying at our apartment until September. At that point we're likely to =
send them to live with my sister, who just bought a nice big house in =
Seattle, for their retirement.=20

flaws that are hard to ignore, reliability of political representatives, =

prices, =E2=80=A6 you name it) =E2=80=93 I might be able to offer help =
and assistance right on site, since Josephine=E2=80=99s godmother and =

wonderful people and they might be able to give advice. So let me know =

to an Israeli real estate mogul) found a very nice spot in =
=E2=80=9ETegel=E2=80=9C =E2=80=93 which is the airport part of the city =

zillions of extra taxpayers=E2=80=98 Euros being spent, they might open =
on October 31 =E2=80=93 that makes Tegel very attractive, once the =
aircrafts are gone, because it=E2=80=99s green and rather residential, =

J=C3=B6rg,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &nbsp;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So good to hear from =
you!! We made it to Iceland a couple weeks ago, thank goodness. The sad =
part is that it now looks like we may need to stay - and may not even be =
able to get back to move our stuff out/over/etc. Very disruptive times. =
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &nbsp;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the upside, we're looking at =
Berlin as a possible next &quot;home,&quot; which would make us much =
more like neighbors than we have been to date. And also means I'll be =
able to buy that dinner for you sooner!!! ;)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =
&nbsp;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No promises, and everything is up in the air, of =
course, but I wanted to at least toss it up as something we're =
considering. The fact that I have Icelandic citizenship has opened a lot =
of doors.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &nbsp;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Glad to hear you're all =
