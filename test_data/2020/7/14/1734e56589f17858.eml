Yes call me on skype or zoom at 10 am icelandic time.

Netflix has been here with us crews so that is all possible.

There is a discussion to take tax incentive to 30 or 35% but probably takes
some time to get through parliament. So for something that is happening
right now I would say the advantage in Iceland is that filming has never
stopped here and they don't need quarantine.

Are you talking about a theatre stage? I need to know more about the
production to be able to advice.

Xahh
