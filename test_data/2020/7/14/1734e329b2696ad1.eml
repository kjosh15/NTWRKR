Hi Josh,

Outstanding does not mean that you owe any money for this equity award. It =
means that it is currently outstanding in your name and has not been cancel=
led, transferred or terminated. Any payment for RSA's are done off the Cart=
a platform and you would need to check with Shortlist project Inc if there =
is any additional payment needed.

Subject: RSA Outstanding
My RSA is listed as status: outstanding. I thought I'd already paid the cas=
h cost for this; does outstanding mean I still owe the Cash Cost for these =
shares? I couldn't find any link to pay it if so.

Thanks!
Josh
