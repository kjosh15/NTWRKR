Allen,

You'd asked what my questions would be for BCG DV:

   - Do they have a need for:
      - working with large corporations' leaders to identify opportunities,
      investments, and needs?
      - new ideas for startups, corporate partners, technology
      opportunities?
      - research into viability of new markets / technologies?
   - How do they work across the EU/US? (I'm a citizen in both
   jurisdictions)
   - They appear to invest in a variety of sectors; where do they see their
   biggest growth opportunities?
   - How are they getting ahead of the market changes presented by Covid-19=
?
   - Do they or are they looking to work in Asia?

Really curious to learn more - they're doing really cool stuff!

- J
