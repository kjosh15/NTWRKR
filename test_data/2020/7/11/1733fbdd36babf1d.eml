Don=E2=80=99t think so, tbh I can=E2=80=99t find anything other than what I=
 sent you! Maybe
send the doc I quoted to them and ask if that=E2=80=99s what they=E2=80=99r=
e working from,
and if they pass back what you sent me apologize and cite a mixup between
you and I?

Would much rather have $6/head than $1, but of course would also rather
have them as a client than not...
