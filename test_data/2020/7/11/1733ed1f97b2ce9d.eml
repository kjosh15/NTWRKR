Annalisa,

Finally got some time to review your Nature article in more detail. First
impressions include yes, yes, and hell yes. Really refreshing to see this
issue addressed more comprehensively!

I particularly appreciated how you broke the issue down by potential
implementation area, such as robotics, AI, NLP, etc. as they all require
different solution construction considerations even if they suffer from
similar systemic problems.

We're looking closely now at using IndigoMetrics to help in addressing D&I
initiatives, particularly around gender (difficult as system frameworks of
hierarchy tend to overwhelm signal) and race (difficult because - sadly -
it's unusual to get large enough samples to create representative
diagnostics.) I'm excited to share your piece with my co-founder to see if
this can inform our approach!

Congrats again, btw - publishing in Nature is no mean feat. Nicely done,
nicely timed, and a very important topic well articulated!!

- J
