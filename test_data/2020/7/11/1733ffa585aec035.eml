I did a little digging and I *think* we'd only be eligible for $1000 (the
EIDL is up to $10k as a "grant", but only at $1k/employee.) That's not tax
deductible, so it's really more like $660, and it has to be used for
something like rent. So, not nothing, but also possibly not worth the
paperwork and concomitant risk of getting a bad ruling. I'll ask our
accountant!

xoxo,
Josh
