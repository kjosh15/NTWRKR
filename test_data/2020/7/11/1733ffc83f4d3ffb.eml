Not sure how much you've been boning up on the PPP vs EIDL etc. etc. A
number of my freelancer friends have been pushing me to apply for the
forgivable $10k "grant" the SBA provides outside of the PPP (I believe this
is the EIDL.)

However, as I read it the grant is only available for up to $1k / employee,
is taxable, and cannot be used for the same purpose as the PPP.

I can certainly spend $666 on rent and related business expenses, but am I
understanding it right that a) I'm eligible, and b) for what?

Hope you're holding up well out there!!
