When last we spoke I asked what sort of collateral you'd suggest for
finding contract work, and you asked that I send you what I usually
provide.

On consideration I realized that all of my work for the last decade or so
has come through direct conversations with decision makers; I didn't have a
CV until this year, and then only because it was required by the agency
looking to hire me.

Instead I usually send my presskit (attached) and point people to my site
<http://www.josh.is> and maybe my Wikipedia entry
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Klein> if they need validation to
sell inside the org. If I'm really pushing for introductions for contract
work I have a contracting site <http://www.h4xindustries.com> I use, but
TBH I've never used it.

Instead nearly 100% of the time I have a conversation with someone about a
problem they have and suggest I could do some work for them on it, I send
them a contract, and it's done.

Obviously I can do better - or at least could generate more choice - with
some good collateral, and given that we're all virtual now it seems like a
smart move. Do you have any suggestions?

Much obliged!
Josh
