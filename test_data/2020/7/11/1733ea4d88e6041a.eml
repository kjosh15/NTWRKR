Hello from Iceland; we made it out here a couple weeks ago after a rather
exciting set of last minute negotiations. Hope you're doing well wherever
you are!!

I wanted to check in to see where you stood on fundraising; I've been
talking with an angel/early seed funder as well as with a couple funds and
a VC, and everyone is curious about good leads. (As opposed to the last few
months, where it was a firm "not right now" across the board.) Where are
you at in funding, are you interested in introductions, and how else can I
help?

All best wishes,
Josh
