All good! I=E2=80=99m in Iceland now, out in the countryside. Can def see w=
hat you
like about the remote lifestyle, esp. now that all f2f is off the table...

Been exchanging notes with a Russian operator and a friend upstate, as well
as chasing Ponoko. Overall same slow steady progress as ever...

Oh, and apparently New Zealand researchers love our platform!! Haven=E2=80=
=99t
reached out yet (am trying to get contract work as all my speaking fell off
a cliff this year) but am excited to hear what they=E2=80=99re up to.

How are you? New place coming along?
