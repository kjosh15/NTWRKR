Had another conversation with Scott Sherman, founder of Transformative
Action institute. They're hugely respected in their field, and he's in the
middle of building out a D&I component of their Skills for the
21st century. We agree to look for an opportunistic reason to work
together.

Bechtel is looking at D&I as a priority this year and David Wilson has
already said he felt Indigo could bring a lot of impact there. Being able
to offer a third party solution gives us an entrance point to expand
Indigo's impact with them along with proving out such a solution TAI could
resell elsewhere.

Summary: nothing to do about this now, but keep in mind we now have an
answer to "can you use this for D&I?" on top of our platform.
