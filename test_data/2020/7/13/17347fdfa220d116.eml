Great news across the board; really glad Weena has been helpful, and
pleased to imagine you with family at the beach.

Things here are exactly the same as before the pandemic - no masks, no
distancing, and no infections (they had three cases last week, the largest
spike in a month). They're testing at the border and so far it's working,
which leaves us feeling slightly schizophrenic. Big question now is whether
to go back to NYC - especially if school is only available virtually.

Take care and enjoy,
Josh
