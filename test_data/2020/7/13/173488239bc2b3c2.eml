Firstly, congratulations!!! It looks like you're in an amazingly beautiful
space, and such a wonderful family. Josephine is so big now!!

Secondly, I cannot thank you enough for your kind offer reg. Berlin. Right
now we're very much in the air, with big questions about my work, my
startup, the boys' school in NYC, the rate of infection, etc. etc. etc. all
TBD. That said, please be ready for me to reappear in your inbox with a
request for introductions - I'm quite keen to explore living in Berlin and
as I understand it the housing component is perhaps the most complicated
element.

Regardless of all of the above let me know if you have time in the weeks
ahead for a quick zoom just to catch up. On a purely personal level one of
the biggest gifts of the pandemic is a reaffirmation of our intention to
stay well connected with true friends, and I'd be keen to hear from you
directly about how you got through these crazy last few months!

With gratitude,
Josh

P.S. I would be remiss not to answer Josephine's question (and thanks to
her for asking!) The cats are being taken care of by a friend who is
staying at our apartment until September. At that point we're likely to
send them to live with my sister, who just bought a nice big house in
Seattle, for their retirement.
