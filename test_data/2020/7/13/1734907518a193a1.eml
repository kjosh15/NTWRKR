Tell me who in your entire World 50 group would NOT consider it valuable to
put a direct report into a working group on this topic?

What's more, can you take a swag at what you could make as part of a
facilitation fee for any activity? You can buy off-the-shelf contract
management services who essentially position you as the neutral middleman,
with a cut of each deal. Could be a HUGE boon for your members, no?

Is this something we could build up out of Innovating 50? (Given that W50
at large tends to be conservative?)
