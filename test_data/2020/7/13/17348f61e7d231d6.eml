Wanted to give you a quick update prior to our call:

I spoke to Scott about Avenues and his Skills for the 21st Century
curriculum. Turns out they mostly did training for the former on the
latter. That said, he strongly believes it would be incredibly powerful for
a k-12 audience.

Similarly, he's currently working with Milano Harden, who leads the Genius
Group <http://thegeniusgroup.com/about-us/meet-the-team-our-story/>, to
make diversity and inclusion a central part of the entire curriculum.

<http://thegeniusgroup.com/about-us/meet-the-team-our-story/>
I've got some ideas about how to use this as a framework to wrap your
education offering this fall in order to elevate the community and
diversity aspects of Ella Baker while also making it available to other
schools, and possibly generate new revenue stream(s) for EB in the process.

I've attached the initial version of the Skills Handbook Scott developed
previously to give you an idea of what sort of content is included. Take a
look, and let's talk Wednesday!

All best wishes,
Josh

P.S. Have a think about what large corporate providers could provide
significant advantage to underwriting / supporting this sort of effort. I
can connect with Scholastic, for example. More Wed!
