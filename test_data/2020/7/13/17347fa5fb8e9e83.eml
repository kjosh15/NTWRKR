It's a little overwhelming, but the more I looked at it the more it seemed
to echo what I'm hearing from leaders about the direction they feel they
need to go. Moving your entire white-collar workforce to virtual meant
moving from a parental ("i'll tell you what to do and you do it") to
collaborative model where workers have significantly new autonomy - and
effective collaboration at scale can't be achieved without a LOT of what
was listed on this worksheet. Super interesting!! How are you implementing
this at home?
