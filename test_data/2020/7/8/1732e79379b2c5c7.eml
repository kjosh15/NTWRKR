Smari,

Excellent talking yesterday! To follow up on some points in our
conversation:

1) You mentioned knowing an Irish social media guy doing D&I work who might
be interested/ing to talk to about the D&I work we're doing on
IndigoMetrics. Can you introduce?

2) Happy to talk to Jeannine Haas, CMO at Gulfstream, about the opportunity
in Iceland for aerospace. Do you have any links / references / short
summary of key points I could use to describe this?

3) Happy to present at the event at the end of August. How do I get
officially signed, is there any budget whatsoever, and where can I learn
more to scope? Similarly, what's the ask/offer for outside thought leaders
I might intro/invite?


Otherwise give me a week or so to catch up and then let's schedule a time
for me to come back to R.vik for a day or two so as to connect more broadly
with the business / political community there. I'd be eternally grateful
for your help in this one!!

Finally, I'm looking forward to talking through =E2=80=9Cthe big game=E2=80=
=9D together -
definitely an over-beer topic to get into detail. So many opps...!

All best,
Josh
