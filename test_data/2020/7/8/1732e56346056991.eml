Thanks for the advice! However, I think that the market rate lease renewal
protections are applicable to all tenants now:

https://www1.nyc.gov/content/tenantprotection/pages/new-protections-for-all=
-tenants

I.e., we've been here more than two years, so the landlord would have to
give us notice 90+ days in advance if they don't intend to offer to renew,
and cannot increase more than 5%. Do you disagree?

Also, now that you're stepping back from running the union as much, what
are you focused on? Just want to try to support you all in turn after all
you've done for the community!
