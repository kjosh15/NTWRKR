William, Josh, you guys should talk.<br>
<br>
I mentioned to Josh the other day the kind of stuff William is<br>
doing with The Worker Agency in bringing super high quality<br>
communications strategy to organizations that typically wouldn&#39;t<br>
communicate quite that well.<br>
<br>
Josh is involved in a psychometrics company that does stuff he<br>
can probably better explain than I could, but feels like the<br>
non-creepy, arm-the-resistence antidote to a world that&#39;s been<br>
fucked by Cambridge Analytica type stuff.<br>
<br>
I am almost certain that both of those intros are largely<br>
uninformative and unfair. But that&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll figure out the<br=
>
rest. :-)<br>
<br>
It does occur to me that it&#39;d be very nice to have a beer with<br>
both of you simultaneously. Maybe sometime!<br>
