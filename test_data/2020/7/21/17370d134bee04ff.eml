Had a good convo with them; they suggested that rather than solely passing
value and relationships over to partners they assemble an advisory board +
a set of =E2=80=9Clevers=E2=80=9D (D&I, L&D, infernal comms, etc.) to creat=
e cultural
change with Canvas 8 at the head.

Talked about BSS as they both want to do cultural change and development.
Canvas 8 is happy to either run the front end of this for all solutions
(their preferred approach as they think this has huge potential), or just
be a potential solution we pass corporates on to.

Let=E2=80=99s talk about this - I think we should market test it if there=
=E2=80=99s a way
to avoid stepping on BSS.
