Is it worth including some notations to the effect that the response times,
etc. are indicative of an overall positive trend we usually see continue
with out clients (over longer time spans)?

Item 3 of Operational Elements was obscured by the graphic, so be sure to
export to PDF and double check it.

A brief precis and summery be useful here? I.e., "Everything operated
within scope and as expected, results began slow and began to rapidly
improve, which is in line with what we normally see etc. etc. etc. "?
