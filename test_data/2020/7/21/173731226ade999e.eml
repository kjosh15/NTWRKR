Glad you made it out, huge bummer to have to leave but it seems very =
unlikely that things will return to anything resembling functional in =
less than a year. $800! I forget, you have two kids? Wow. I think even =
for us w/ one kid it's something like $1200/month for basic coverage.

As for plans, within our county the infected population seems to be =
plateauing at around 0.5% for now though we are not taking strong enough =
measures to drive that lower and substantial reopening will certainly =
drive the numbers way up. It looks like Trump is gearing up to dispute =
the election and use DHS to suppress unrest after. They're already =
testing things out in cities including Portland and Seattle. It's not a =
very cheery outlook. With the family here in Seattle it would be a big =
deal for us to leave but we're evaluating visa options for Canada or EU =
(via Bulgaria where Plamena is from).

Strangely I just looked at Twitter on my phone and it's advertising =
Iceland to me.

Are German visas reasonably attainable?
