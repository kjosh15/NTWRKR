Glad to hear you're well - it's a strange time in the world where you know
people are busier than ever, and yet you're always worried they're dead. I
say that only partly in jest, sadly.

We're in Iceland as of about a month ago. It was really hard to leave NYC,
but there is basically no Covid here, the kids can play in the forest with
a pack of their friends, etc. etc. The *really* hard part is that given all
the volatility in the US we're likely not coming back until after XMas...
if then. :/

Otherwise my startup venture has been blowing up in the wake of Covid-19.
Companies are suddenly realizing they need better metrics to manage
employees that are fully remote. Lots of good stuff going on there.

Congrats on the Artist Rescue Trust!! Knew you'd get into something cool.
Also curious about your consulting; have you set up a strategy to sell "the
SXSW way"?

All best to you and yours,
Josh
