I know this is a clickbait headline, but it does point to a larger point I
find very compelling: we don't know what the long term complications of the
disease are. As far back as March I was talking to a friend who's
girlfriend was an MD who had seen very serious long term impacts on the
lungs of the infected; brain damage is just another vector we hadn't
anticipated.

Guess we should just not get it. :)

xoxo,
Josh
