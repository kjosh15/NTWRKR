Josh,

Perhaps a different approach -- My team has built/hacked together a
wellness-check app for the company (it is a super simple questionnaire that
allows an employee to request access to the facility, answer
some questions, and get a recommendation to either come into the facility
or stay at home). This app is now turning into a data gathering mechanism
to gather employee sentiment (do they want to work from home, do they
prefer to come into the office, do they feel anxious, etc..). We are likely
going to move into a majority-will-work-from-home model going forward. I
see many questions being asked about productivity, etc..

Perhaps we can integrate your solution into this framework. Anyway, if we
can give my design team an overview of how/what your solution does, we can
try to factor that in.

Let me know,
-Mahesh
