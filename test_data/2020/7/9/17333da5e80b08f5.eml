Read it - it's bad science / clickbait. Turns out that people in Elmherst
who wanted to get checked for Covid had a very high incidence of
antibodies, in one place up to 65%.

The reason it's bad science is that herd immunity was estimated by one
scientist to =3D 65% ... in a static population. So if 65% of the planet ha=
d
it the virus would be likely to die off. Or, if 65% of people on an island.
Etc.

In other words, just because there is a small pocket in our neighborhood
with high levels of antibodies doesn't mean we're less likely to get it
unless we only ever interacted with people known to have antibodies. And
that's assuming antibodies means you're no longer transmissible or able to
get it.

Onward!
xoxo,
Josh
