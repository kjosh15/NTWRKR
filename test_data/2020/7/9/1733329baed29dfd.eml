Are you available to speak at 9am EST Wednesday? As ever, if you're
underwater and I'm not being helpful feel free to push this off. Otherwise,
I'd like to:

- Talk about how I and other parents can best support you in designing
solutions for this fall (there are a few parent groups already mobilizing
in Queens and I'd love to align everyone with your efforts),

- Update you on the Transformative Action Institute and any resources they
might have to offer in terms of a remote learning curriculum,

- Hear your overall thoughts on the recent announcements on school
structures for this fall.

Let me know and I'll send an invite if you're available!

All best,
Josh

P.S. I'm sure you're getting deluged with content, but FWIW I thought this
piece on reopenings was one of the more comprehensive I'd seen:
