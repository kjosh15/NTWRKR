d the box in an open area, making sure I was ten feet
from anything a squirrel could use as a jumping off platform.=C2=A0 But I d=
on&#39;t see a lot of crows in this patch
of exurbia and have a feeling that it&#39;s going to be days or weeks befor=
e crows
start landing on my box. I might have to start placing peanuts at various
places in the open field nearby. That might capture their attention as they=
 fly
over. A woman who saves wounded crows told me crows are crazy about day-old
&quot;pinkie mice,&quot; which you can buy frozen in pet stores. If anybody=
 has
any suggestions, let me know.</span></p>

involved in this project. They can help feed the box, move the video files =
from
the camera and possibly create a website to document what happens. Several =
are
showing up at an intro meeting to be held this Saturday. If they experience=
 the
frustration of waiting for the crows to show up...well, that&#39;s part of =
the
scientific process, too. I&#39;ll keep you informed. </span></p>
