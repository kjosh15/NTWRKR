I did some digging into AWS Artifact and it looks like we could save a
great deal of trouble around SOC2 compliance. Given that you've done most
of the work here I'd suggest reviewing this article:

https://linfordco.com/blog/aws-soc-2/

My read is that we can try submitting the AWS SOC2 documents to Misha along
with our automated external application security audit and pentest and see
if he needs anything else. To get AWS's SOC2 report see:

https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/

Additionally, other compliance reports can be found here:

https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/faq/

Not sure we need any of these, but they may give us a bootstrapping
resource for whatever else Misha suggests.

Let me know if I can help further here,
Josh
