If we need a tech hire, we contracted Felix five years ago when first
talking about Indigo. Now they go by "F" and seem like potentially a hot
mess - but also a pretty talented cross-stack developer. Their dad is a
friend of mine and one of the best cryptographers around; he helped develop
Apache, among other things. More info here:

No action suggested, but if we're looking to diversify we could do worse
than a queer agender mentally ill tech lead.

Keeping it interesting,
Josh
