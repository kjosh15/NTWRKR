<div>I used a lawyer, which I highly recommend. Is she looking to follow thi=

<div><br>
</div>
<div>- The committee runs a vote twice a year, so timing on the language tes=

<br>
</div>
<div>- The CIA-approved criminal record forms are a royal PITA; pay a servic=
e to get these stamped appropriately and returned quickly, if you can.</div>=

<div>- The language test isn't as daunting as it sounds, but they only hold t=
hem in Iceland and only art certain times of the year - so again, plan accor=
dingly.</div>
