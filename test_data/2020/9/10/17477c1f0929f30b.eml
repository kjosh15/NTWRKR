We're all set for the cats to fly to Seattle! Here's their flight details:

Alaska Airlines flight #1063
DEPART: from JFK Wed, Oct 7th at 5:00 pm
ARRIVE: at SEA Wed, Oct 7th at 8:20 pm


Polina and Lucas will be transporting them; their contact info is:

Polina Tereshina, 206-353-4161, polinatereshina@gmail.com
Lucas Berthou, 206-486-0287, lucas.berthou@gmail.com


Please reach out prior to October to confirm timing, handoff details, etc.
(For example, they'll need to arrive at JFK two hours prior to departure,
will be picking up checked bags on arrival, etc.)

We cannot thank you enough for helping manage this huge transition in our
pets' lives - thank you!!!

Much love,
Josh, Hulda, Othinn and Haakon
