Chris suggested some edits:

IndigoMetrics is an expert system that can change human behavior
autonomously and at scale around any set of actions that can be peer
observed. It does this by creating a bias-adjusted, statistically relevant
expert model drawn from peer-to-peer evaluations of observed behaviors that
relate to a company's core values. This model then pairs anonymous
suggestions based on value disparities across the network graph to leverage
social proof in creating individual behavior change.

As a result, the system can also calculate relative movement in usually
hard-to-model elements such as D&I, psychological safety, innovation, and
more. This statistics allow for scaled multivariate tests of content,
experiences, and interactions that can cause additional system and
individual change.

The positive impact of the platform has already been assessed across a
number of corporate workspaces. IndigoMetrics would now like to work with
an academic institution to validate the impact of its system as an example
of a new class of algorithmic influencing platform in order to enable new,
more comprehensive, and more critical use of this kind of technology going
forward.
