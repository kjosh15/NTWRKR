Hi Josh and Betsy,

I am very excited about this PD I've been accepted to hosted by TCRWP about
maximizing student learning during this strange time. I know how tight
budgets are so my plan is to pay for this out of pocket. However, if it's
possible to get even some of the cost reimbursed I'd really appreciate it.
I'm excited to share everything I learn with my colleagues!

Best,
Marlee

Dear Marlee,

I am delighted to tell you that you've been accepted into *Rethinking the
Classroom: Digital Best Practices that Maximize Student Learning in
Virtual, In-Person, and Hybrid Environments*! Part of what makes our
institutes so exciting is that they bring people together from all over the
world=E2=80=94and we=E2=80=99re excited to think that you will be among the=
m. This
institute runs from Monday, October 26 - Tuesday, October 27, 2020. The
hours of the institute are 11am-5pm Eastern Daylight Time. A reminder that
this institute is offered virtually live, only, and sessions are not
recorded for later distribution.

In response to COVID-19, *Rethinking the Classroom: Digital Best Practices
that Maximize Student Learning in Virtual, In-Person, and Hybrid
Environments will be led virtually via Zoom*. We are responding to the
latest information from Columbia University to be mindful of the health and
well-being of our community, as well as to provide you with great
professional development. Unfortunately, we are restricted from hosting
people on campus.

We need to caution you, however, that this is a conditional acceptance,
contingent on us receiving payment=E2=80=94or news about payment=E2=80=94wi=
thin 14
days. The cost of this institute is $400/per person. To pay for the
institute, upon which your acceptance will be finalized, please log in to
your account here: www.readingandwritingproject.org/member. Then, click the
link that reads "Submit a PO for an Institute" or "Make Payment by Credit
Card" (if that was your selected payment method). Payment or a purchase
order must be submitted prior to the start of the institute. If you need
an extension, please write to us at
registration@readingandwritingproject.com.

*Withdrawal Deadline *for Rethinking the Classroom: Digital Best Practices
that Maximize Student Learning in Virtual, In-Person, and Hybrid
Environments: Monday, October 12, 2020

Sometimes life intervenes and a person who has been accepted to the
institute cannot, in the end, attend. We always have a waitlist, so please
let us know as early as possible if you are withdrawing. Once you have
paid, this is a commitment that you plan to attend. If you must withdraw
after paying, I=E2=80=99m afraid that we charge a $50 withdrawal fee. More
importantly, if you must withdraw after Monday, October 12, 2020 for this
institute, we need to charge you for the entire cost of the institute.

It is important to emphasize that if you need to withdraw, your spot will
be given to someone on the waiting list. That is, you cannot send a
substitute participant in your place =E2=80=93 instead, your place is given=
 to the
next person on the waiting list. Occasionally, districts enter a teacher
under someone else's name in order to circumvent our practice of
not allowing substitutes. Participating in such a practice jeopardizes
your relationship and your district's relationship with the Project.

We look forward to seeing you at our Rethinking the Classroom: Digital Best
Practices that Maximize Student Learning in Virtual, In-Person, and Hybrid
Environments!

Sincerely,
Lucy Calkins
