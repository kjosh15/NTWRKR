Thanks Gu=C3=B0n=C3=BD!

I have a kennitala, but expect that having an Icelandic LLC makes more
sense as I=E2=80=99d like to have no only the tax mitigation opportunities =
as well
as the liability protection.

The big question I can=E2=80=99t seem to get an answer on is what the tax
implications from the USA are. Nobody in Iceland seems to know, and none of
the professionals I have spoken to in the USA know about Iceland!

Separately, it seems a bit expensive to set up an Icelandic LLC - I=E2=80=
=99m used
to the USA where it takes $20 and a couple days after filling out a web
form. Is this something you could do and if so at what cost?

Many thanks,
Josh
