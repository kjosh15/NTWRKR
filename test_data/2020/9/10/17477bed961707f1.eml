Hello Josh

Sorry about the late reply.

As I understand it the legislation covers:

a) Temporary workers (less than 5 years) when an employer sends an 
employee to Iceland, he/she is covered under US laws

b) If you live in Iceland but employed in Iceland for over 5 years, but 
temporarily work for US companies, you are covered under Icelandic laws

If self employed you fall under the laws of the country where you live

In Iceland you can work under your own personal kennitala (still being 
self employed) or under a company kennitala (which is often better, 
because you can deduct expenses). It depends how high your annual 
turnover is. Do you you have an Icelandic kennitala?

I think it would be best to talk directly to the Icelandic authorities. 
I can do so for you and figure out how best to set this up, but I would 
of course need to charge for my time:)

I am going abroad for about 10-14 days tomorrow but I could follow up 
when coming back, if you like. Otherwise, it would probably be best to 
talk to a lawyer, I know a few good ones:)

Best regards,

Guðný G.

                                        contracts from a variety of
                                        parties in locations ranging
                                        from Texas to Japan (mostly US,
                                        no EU.) Because of the nature of
                                        the work, some of these
                                        contracts may be one-time
                                        payments of large lump sums,
                                        some may be regular monthly
                                        checks. Overall income can vary

                                        income ranging from 1-300k USD,
                                        and I advise a couple startups
                                        that may have exits in the next
                                        couple years.</div>

                                        recognize that may not be most
                                        suitable given that ultimately I
                                        may be tax liable in Iceland.
                                        Normally I would pay myself a
                                        small stipend from the US
                                        account and deduct almost

                                        what works best. What do you
                                        suggest, and/or can I supply
