Maybe I'm just getting old but don=E2=80=99t think this is terribly =
relevant at the moment - this type of analysis depends upon =
self-correcting markets driven by the balance of buyers and sellers - =
and at the moment markets and opportunities are driven by political =
choices (primarily helicopter money) and changes that may not be =
self-correcting (ie COVID). When such external factors are large then =
technical bubbles can be sustained for the long term - or even become =
permanent.
Having ranted about that I do think there is mileage in thinking more =
deeply about markets we care about
- there is the corporate management of people market, which we talk =
about quite a bit and we are learning about slowly as we add customers
- but then I would also suggest 2 more areas (i) the self-determined =
behaviour change market and (ii) the politico/societal determined =
behaviour change market
Sometimes I like a plan to use the platform we have built to raise funds =
to push on hard into the second sector - essentially by hiring social =
thinkers, UI experts and advertising experts to push hard into generic =
behaviour change - but I'm not sure where the monetization is for that =
(if it matters at this stage).
I know I keep coming back to the subject of the SXSW talk!

I keep trying to read this as I believe there is useful insight here, =
but I=E2=80=99ll be damned if I=E2=80=99m able to tease it out. Does it =
make immediate sense to you as valuable in terms of estimating near term =
impact on the markets we care about?
