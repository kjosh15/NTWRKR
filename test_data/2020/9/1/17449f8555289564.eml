Can you call and leave a message and then send a text to 206-925-3259?

It's a "personal" google account which I can use via google voice and
google hangout to park my US cell # without fees. It's slightly less
convenient than using my @josh.is account, but it saves me $10/month.

if your messages come through ok I'll run the port and will then be able to
close my AT&T account, saving $175/month (i.e., I'll still have to pay
$25/month for much better speeds and equivalent functionality here in
Iceland!)

Love,
Josh
