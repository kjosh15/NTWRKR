>Sonali,<br><br>I hope you and your girls are as well as possible, all thing=
s considered!! I wanted to check in and update you on our conversation with G=
ustavo, plans for the cats, etc. <br><br>Right now we're planning to have Gu=
stavo move in Sept. 1. He is going to help us get all our personal stuff pac=
ked up, and hopefully we'll be able to negotiate a lease extension with our l=
andlord so he can stay on through the end of the year.<br><br>In the meantim=
e, my sister is still available to take the cats, and there's a young couple=
 in Brooklyn who can fly with them to her en route to visiting their mom on/=
around Oct 9th. We'd need the cats to get to the vet within ten days before t=
he flight to get updated health certificates, etc. <br><br>So! A few questio=
ns:<br><br>1. Can you move the cats and their stuff to your place before Sep=
tember 1?<br>2. Does early October work for you to say goodbye to the cats?<=
br>3. Can you bring the cats to the vet before then?<br><br>As ever, let us k=
now what we can do to help support you and yours. We're thinking of you ofte=
n and sending all our love and best wishes. <br><br>yours,<br>Josh<br></div>=
