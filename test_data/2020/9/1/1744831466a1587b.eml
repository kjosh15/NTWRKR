Hi folks!

I got my crowbox built and got to the stage of function testing 
(electronics stage 5) and things seemed to be working properly... but then 
not quite. During the stage 2 testing, the sliding lid behaved as expected 
when one of the switches was pushed, but when the other was pushed it would 
not wait before closing but would instead wait just a second or two before 
closing halfway, opening again, and then waiting another second or two 
before doing the normal incremental close. The next time around, it did the 
same thing, with only the other switch (seemed to be the second one pushed 
either way?)

Stage 3 and stage 4 saw this weird behavior again of starting to close up 
again right away after a coin was passed through, then opening again, then 
normal incremental close. And in the 20 minutes I've sat here mulling, it's 
just now decided to open and close on its own while sitting at stage 3.

So I had been suspecting something wrong with the switches, but the fact 
that it's doing the same thing in stage 3/4 when the switches have no 
effect seems like it points to something else. Servo? Arduino? Something 
not quite right with the wiring? This is my first project of this sort so 
I'm not sure how to troubleshoot. Though I do note that my servo seems to 
take quite a while of whirring to itself when it's booting and getting 
parked after I power on or hit the reset, about twice as long as it seems 
to take in the videos.

If anyone has seen this before and can point me in the right direction, I 
would be grateful!

~Jay
