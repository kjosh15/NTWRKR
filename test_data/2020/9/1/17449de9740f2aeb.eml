I was going to mail this to the list, but wanted to make sure you were ok
with my making the ask first:

#######
We've got a couple power issues that need research we can't complete
ourselves right now. If you're interested, both/either could really help us
in offering more mobile options for the Crowbox:

1) Cabling. Someone suggested stepping power down to 5 volts and THEN
running power across a lawn/terrain to the box, but we don't know offhand
of a good cable (that is, a nice long cable) that can carry 5VDC a long
distance and not also involve loss of precious voltage. Mainly because we
never explored it so we don't have a good idea of cost, and we don't have
data on voltage loss (to wire resistance) across that distance. In the
current plans, we very strongly suggest (demand, really) that users employ
a GFCI outlet and/or an in-line GFCI with their A/C extension cord to
promote safety. If there's anyone out there who has
time/interest/capability to research this we'd love to publish their
results!

2) Portable power. The demand for this seems huge and we did limited
preliminary testing quite some time ago, but with some discouraging
results. We tested five banks and only the VOLTAIC brand properly worked on
low-current devices without shutting itself off. The nominal use-case these
devices are designed for means that 95% of them have auto-shutoff functions
which are largely unlabeled. That said, while voltaic power banks are a
little expensive they're less expensive than most in-line GFCI switches for
extension cords and so could be a good tradeoff for many people. Is anyone
out there able to do an updated study on currently available voltaic banks
to see which ones DON'T have the auto-shut-off feature so we can point
people at good alternatives?

Much obliged,
Josh


P.S. In case you're skimming the above DON'T JUST BUY an $18.00 30,000mAh
power bank from Amazon and expect it to work!
#######

best,
Josh
