Gustavo,

Welcome welcome!! Really excited to have a young family enjoying our place
while we're away. Please do let us know if you have any questions as you're
getting settled in!

We've already sent you our guide, so you should have lots of documentation
at the ready. In the meantime, I wanted to reiterate the points we covered
in our last call and let you know what we're doing to help support.

There were a few things we needed done while you're there this Sept:

1. Can you see if there's any mail from HiOscar? They were going to mail us
a check as we closed out our account with them and I need a picture of the
front and back so I can cash it remotely.

2. We're waiting to see what our friends shipped us in terms of winter
cloths, etc. Depending on what made it we're likely to have a second round
of stuff we need packed up, weighed, and then dropped off at FedEx. We
should have this list by next week.

3. Otherwise we need our personal effects packed up and moved to storage.
We'll make a room-by-room list, order boxes and packing tape, and find and
reserve a storage company location. If you could get everything packed up
and moved over by the end of the month that would be an enormous help; our
goal is to be able to "just" pack up the remaining kitchen, toys, and
household stuff and move it into storage quickly in case we need to vacate
the place. To that end, if you could label and weigh each box and keep a
record as you pack that'll make it possible for us to have stuff shipped
over later as we are able to save up enough to pay for it.

That said, we understand you're going to have your hands full being a dad,
entrepreneur, and human being in the middle of a pandemic in all this so
will do everything we can to make this easy. Please feel free to ask
questions!


Additionally, there were a few things we're not sure Sonali was able to get
to. We know she's had her hands full so haven't followed up, but could you
check:

- There may be some boxes stacked in the living room on the side near the
front door marked "give away." Can you drop them off for donation?
Obviously take anything that you need from the pile.

- There may be a small stack of library books on a shelf on the lefthand
side in the dining room. If so, can you return them?

- Is there a light grey glasses case on the second shelf in the hallway
(next to the mirror)? If so, I'd love to send it in to get the lenses
replaced before having it shipped here!

I know this probably seems like a lot, so feel free to revert piecemeal and
we'll work it out as we go. We'll work on getting that list to you ASAP
along with ordering the packing materials, and will keep you updated on our
ongoing negotiations with the landlord. In return, let us know if you have
any questions. Looking forward to continuing to build a mutually beneficial
relationship!!

All best wishes,
Josh
