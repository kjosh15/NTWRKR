Steve,

Sorry for the slow turnaround on these notes; really appreciate the thought
you put into these but have just been underwater with unexpectedly moving
my family to another country. I hope your move is going more smoothly!

I'm following up on the list about where and how to include info on
outdoor/portable power issues. Agree we need to publish info on this but
need to do it in a way that doesn't create more confusion. Similarly, I
feel that asking the list might encourage someone to do a little work in
specifying or updating info on what's available.

In terms of the applicator tip and M2 and M3 machine screws, I'm going to
put notes about these directly into the Wiki. You made really good points
about all of these but I don't see anything new to do about it beyond
mentioning them more explicitly.

Finally, both the wingnut closure and waterproofing issues seem like they
need redesign work to solve for. Is this something you can take on, or
should we make an amendment to the published materials and see if anyone
picks up on them? I don't like the latter as it's messy and likely to make
trouble for folks building the kit, but I also fully understand if it's not
in your interest at the moment.

Hope you're doing well out there in the world; did get settled into your
new place yet?

All best,
Josh
