Just came back from a long walk in the woods; lots to follow up on but
wanted to say thank you for your confidence. It's tremendously helpful in
trying to make sense of this disorienting experience to hear both your
perspective and experience, and I'm flattered by your trust.

Sincerely,
Josh
