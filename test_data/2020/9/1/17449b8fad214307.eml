Wanted to reconnect as companies start to peek their heads up and are again
asking "what now?" In response I've revamped my website (www.josh.is) and
presskit (attached) and am wondering what the folks I respect most in this
industry are seeing - hence this email.

Let me know what your purview is and how/where/what we might collaborate
on; I'm getting the most ground with one-on-one sessions, round-table
virtual presentations, and (slowly) some larger virtual conferences. Oh,
and I'm in Iceland now, so easy access to Europe!

I hope you and yours are well; looking forward to hearing more.

All best,
Josh
