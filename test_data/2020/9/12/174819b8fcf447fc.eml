Hulda's been doing some data crunching and had some thoughts on things
Etukai might enjoy;


   - Adjusting the Tripp Trapp chairs to his height
   - Board games (above the door to the kitchen in the living rooms)
   - Collapsible soccer goals (folded flat in a black + blue fabric case)
   - Citrus juicer in the kitchen, operate by pressing half a citrus fruit
   down on it
   - Bow and arrow set in the closet in the kids' room. Fun to bring to
   Landing Lights park!
   - Green silicone microwave popcorn popper in the kitchen (

   )


Hope you guys are having fun!

best,
Josh

P.S. If you could track down any remaining cat supplies and get them to
Sonali she can use them and then you won't have them in the house. Hulda
says: "there's a Ssscat spray can, a Feliway scent plug-in, a couple cat
beds, cat harness, any toys, catnip (in the freezer etc.). Locations to
look include the toy basket, freezer, small brown cabinet in the hallway
(previously under a litter box) and the bottom shelf in the hallway closet
behind the bathroom door. Just in case anything got left behind!"
