Wanted to drop you a quick note before peppering you with more questions. ;=
)

In February I gathered a bunch of tips on corporate fundraising and made a
strategy for Josh Satin. He was very enthusiastic, and then nothing
happened until March, when too much happened.

Anyway, I'm back on it and am trying to put together a glossy brochure and
cover letter parents can use to connect with their company's public
relations person. The idea is to hand them a short packet they can forward
to the right person with a direct ask for funds. This way parents don't
have to do anything more than that, and corporations have an easy, clear,
and direct means to submit funding to Ella Baker.

Michelle Nix has volunteered to do the graphics, I'm munging some text
together, and we've wrangled Betsy into managing the faculty side. Once we
get everything together and are looking for approvals can you take a look
and help us figure out how to make the ask to parents?

Hope you're well all things considered - it's going to be an interesting
year!!!

All best,
Josh
