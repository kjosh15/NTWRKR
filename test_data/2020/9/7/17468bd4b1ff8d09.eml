Hi Josh,

Thanks for the update. Until we get the chance to familiarize ourselves
with the platform I think we could do a couple of things. If your team has
a style sheet documenting some of the basic components (color, typography,
and basic UI elements) I could take a quick look at this and add a few
slides to our master deck with design applications around these elements.
If the platform does not have a style guide yet, you could share with me
screengrabs with some of the key screens, pages, graphics, menus, etc, and
I could put together a very simple style sheet on Figma, with recommended
colors applications, basic button treatments, etc.

In regards to the triangles, I'm glad it caught your eye. I decided to use
geometric shapes, especially triangles for both graphic and conceptual
reasons. Primarily, it's a way for us to connect the way we'll be using
shapes to represent data in our design system. On the other hand, a
triangle is an energetic and dynamic shape that is always associated with
motion and direction, conveying different meanings. An upright triangle
brings feelings of stability and balance but the reversed one looks risky
and ready to fall, giving us a sense of tension. I thought that relates
pretty well with employee's skills, performance, and assessment. I didn't
intend to use it as a logo, but as we evolve with the logo and mark design,
we should definitively keep it in mind.

Cheers,
Harry
