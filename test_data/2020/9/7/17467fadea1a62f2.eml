I've a favor to ask you; if I write up a short quote about the tech
strategy work I did for IDEO NY can you tweak it to fit? I'm looking to
build up some validation for the design side of my portfolio and having a
good word from you would go a long way.

Separately, I'm doing a short presentation to Bifrost on how to pitch later
this month, so hope to have more insight there then. How did your mtg. w/
the MPs go? Ready to revolutionize Iceland yet?

All best,
Josh
