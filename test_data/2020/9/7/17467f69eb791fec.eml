Good to talk to you too!! I'd love an intro to David especially, if that's
possible, and will look at signing up with Factory in the new year. We're
updating our marketing materials now so I'll send you an updated deck on
IndigoMetrics in a week or two. And please do hit me with any Iceland
questions!!

All best wishes,
Josh
