Paul,

Apologies in advance for the bombastic phrasing; writing your own marketing
material is always fraught!! Let me know if you can tweak any of the
following into something you're comfortable with or if you need me to go
back to the drawing board:

1. "We needed a strong technology strategy that integrated some fairly
subtle market dynamics given IDEO's ongoing growth path in new sectors.
Josh delivered in spades with a deeply nuanced strategy plan that
integrated feedback from a variety of staff across the organization and
which gave us the flexibility and benchmarks we needed to grow."

2. "Technology is critical to any organization, but even more so in a
design firm that serves customers across every segment and in markets
across the globe. Josh pulled together a comprehensive document with deep
technical understanding and strong growth benchmarks that gave us the
framework we needed to move forward."

3. "IDEO serves customers in every sort of market all across the world.
When we asked for a technology strategy we knew we needed more than just
another textbook exercise, and Josh delivered. Deeply nuanced with a strong
technology POV, Josh gave us the strategic framework we needed to make
powerful decisions to ensure our growth."

Very much obliged,
Josh
