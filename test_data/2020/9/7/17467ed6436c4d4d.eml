Harry,

We're looking to uplift the IndigoMetrics platform in the short term to
conform to the style guide you made; that way when we send the deck out
this week and site update soon after it all hangs together. The idea is
definitely to do a UX/UI platform redesign based on feedback from BSS, but
expect BSS will have to actually use the platform before that happens and
need to continue our marketing push in the meantime.

So, for now, do you have any advice on using the styleguide to make the
platform conformant? For example, currently the platform background is
white and changing that would be pretty disruptive. Any thoughts are
appreciated!

All best,
Josh

P.S. Are the triangles in the sales deck intended to be the new logo?
