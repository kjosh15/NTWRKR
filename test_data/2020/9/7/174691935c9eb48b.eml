Did you collect any mail from Oscar (the health insurance company) while
you were at ours? They sent a refund check we need a picture of so we can
cash it. We went through the mail Gustavo had collected since he arrived in
a call with him earlier today and it wasn't there.

All best wishes and much thanks,
Josh
