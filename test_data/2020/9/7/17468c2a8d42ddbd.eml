Thanks, Harry! We don't have a stylesheet as yet, but you can check out our
existing platform here:

USERNAME: innov1
PASSWORD: Password123$

A super simple stylesheet sounds perfect; we're planning to do a quick
update accordingly shortly with the expectation that we'll invest in a
fuller UI/UX treatment further down the line.

Much appreciated,
Josh
