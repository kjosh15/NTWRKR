Separately, I need to know what my tax obligations would be if I were
accepting contract payment through an Icelandic LLC (my own.) I've
consulted with local tax authorities and that's the recommended method
given that I'm establishing residency here. Iceland has a double taxation
agreement with the US; I just need to make sure there is no other tax
liability accordingly. Can you confirm?

Thanks!
Josh

you should be asking a CPA. However, to my knowledge, your LLC should be
located in your home state as even online business is considered to be
transacted in your home state. I would still advise you to talk to a CPA
who has international experience because I am sure there are things to
consider and I am not a tax accountant. One way we can have you lower your

contributions before the end of the year.
