Annalisa,

I reviewed your final slide, updated it, and moved it to preface the
closing slide. The only point I dispute is:

"Prevent rather than manage diabetes, obesity, heart disease. Benefits in
Covid 19 health management."

Because I think the tech can really help in management *also*. Aside from
Diabetes, CGMs aren't currently used to manage glucose levels AFAIK, plus
there isn't any evidence that obesity can be "cured" ... but the negative
health impact might be.

As a result I shifted this point to read: "Prevent and then manage
diabetes, obesity, heart disease with benefits in Covid-19 health
management." Does the slide I put in place meet the need you identified, or
do you think the messaging needs to be embedded throughout the rest of the
deck more firmly?

Let me know what you think
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=3Dsharing>,
and thanks a million!


All best,
Josh
