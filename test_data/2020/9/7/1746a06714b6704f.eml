I wanted to share what I learned about the legislation and the tax advice
I've received. I got strong feedback from PWC that while the new
legislation would allow me to use my kennital only (instead of an Icelandic
LLC), it would vastly increase my tax profile because:

- I would be taxed on all work performed in Iceland (regardless of to whom)
- I would have to file an operational tax return as an individual, which is
much more complex
- It would dramatically increase the taxes I would have to pay as all
operational income would be taxed in higher bracket (34-37% instead of 20%)
- I would also be personally liable for whatever work I did.

Separately, running all my funds through a US LLC would mean that I would
have to pay taxes on it as business income in Iceland (as I have
established residency here), then shift the funds to the USA, and then
shift it back to my Icelandic bank account as salary or dividends where it
would be taxed as personal income. So, more complex, more costly, and more
risk exposure.

The person I spoke to was very clear that he'd only ever dealt with one
case involving this legislation, and that because it was so new it took
quite a few hours (and two weeks of back and forth) to get the gov't to
understand what they were doing. Further, it would only apply if I was
working for a US entity here in Iceland, in which case I would see a drop
from 6.35% on social security to 0.24%.

I recognize this is all pursuant my particular situation, but wanted to
pass on what I'd learned as you were so kind as to help me get so far. I'm
certain this will come into play more as time progresses; thanks again for
all the help!

All best wishes,
Josh

<br>
I think the key point with the the social security agreement is that, as <b=
r>
an American citizen and Icelandic resident doing independent work, you <br>
used to have to have an Icelandic company in order to be exempt from US <br=
>
social security tax. Now, you can, at least in theory, do work under <br>
your own kennitala (the Icelandic equivalent of filing Schedule C) and <br>
pay social security taxes only to Iceland. You might also be able to do <br=
>
work under your own kennitala but pay social security taxes only to the <br=
>
US if you prefer that (I&#39;m not sure).<br>
<br>
So again, the issue there was, do you run your income through an <br>
Icelandic company or as Icelandic self-employment.<br>
<br>
The issue PwC is raising is more that of whether you run your income <br>
through the American company or as Icelandic self-employment income. <br>
They&#39;re saying that running your income through the American company <b=
r>
while resident in Iceland might lead to problems with the issue of the <br>
company&#39;s &quot;permanent establishment.&quot; I&#39;m not much of an e=
xpert on that <br>
concept but I might look for a second opinion. However it seems like <br>
there is another way of resolving that problem, besides opening an <br>
Icelandic company, which would be just to work under your own kennitala. <b=
r>
Basically, if the American company turns out to be a headache, you might <b=
r>
not actually need it.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps -- I am a little out of my depth here.<br>
<br>
If you do choose to start an Icelandic company, I suspect you don&#39;t nee=
