Realized I've been wearing your stuff since Abe sewed his second batch in
his apartment right after ITP, and that I've worn Outlier on glaciers, into
volcanos, across Saudi Arabia, as well as through boardrooms and on stages
the world over. I've worn them sitting next to Richard Branson and
presenting after Madeleine Albright, and while slaughtering reindeer in
Iceland. I'm a deep, deep advocate and was wondering if a write up would be
useful to you all. If so, let me know!

All best,
Josh
