Is the water part of what enables a good rise, or does it help build the
crust? I ask as the boys are not huge fans of a crispy crust, hence my
willingness to leave off the water portion of the bake. Also, we have an
oven that can run convection if that helps. Stoked to be learning!

Love,
Josh
