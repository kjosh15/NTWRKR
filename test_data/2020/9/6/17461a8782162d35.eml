Hi Josh,

I think the key point with the the social security agreement is that, as=20
an American citizen and Icelandic resident doing independent work, you=20
used to have to have an Icelandic company in order to be exempt from US=20
social security tax. Now, you can, at least in theory, do work under=20
your own kennitala (the Icelandic equivalent of filing Schedule C) and=20
pay social security taxes only to Iceland. You might also be able to do=20
work under your own kennitala but pay social security taxes only to the=20
US if you prefer that (I'm not sure).

So again, the issue there was, do you run your income through an=20
Icelandic company or as Icelandic self-employment.

The issue PwC is raising is more that of whether you run your income=20
through the American company or as Icelandic self-employment income.=20
They're saying that running your income through the American company=20
while resident in Iceland might lead to problems with the issue of the=20
company's "permanent establishment." I'm not much of an expert on that=20
concept but I might look for a second opinion. However it seems like=20
there is another way of resolving that problem, besides opening an=20
Icelandic company, which would be just to work under your own kennitala.=20
Basically, if the American company turns out to be a headache, you might=20
not actually need it.

I hope that helps -- I am a little out of my depth here.

If you do choose to start an Icelandic company, I suspect you don't need=20
PwC -- you can probably do it all yourself, or perhaps find someone less=20
expensive for the parts you feel you need help with. For me the one=20
thing I paid for was the "sam=C3=BEykktir" for the company, basically the=
=20
founding text. Another option: It's often possible to take over an=20
existing company and there is a market for selling the things solely as=20
administrative entities rather than businesses -- when I left Iceland=20
one of the two guys who had been helping me with my accounting bought my=20
company basically for the registration price as it was simpler to buy an=20
existing corporate kennitala than going through all the paperwork again.

Best regards,
Ian
