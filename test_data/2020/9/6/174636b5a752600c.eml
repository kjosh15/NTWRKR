Very much so. For further clarification, at what level are these students
in terms of pitching? I.e., I can start at the basics (see below) or work
up. Let me know what fits this audience best!

### 1x10-15 min on pitching and introducing ideas

- Know Your Audience
- Know what you want of them
- Tell them a story that:
they like
that motivates them to do what you want
- Ask them to do it
- Example
- Technicalities
breathing
narrative
culture
homework (finance, market, etc.)
authenticity is worth anything else
