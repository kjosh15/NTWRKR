Sounds right to me. Will be curious to hear Michael's take on the problem.
As an antecedent, I spent some time thinking about the future for Indigo
and keep coming back to AI and other uses of our data, both predictive and
proscriptive. From this angle content is a part of the solution, but is
much more agnostic. AI is also a more scalable magic sauce...

But yes, hear you about the raise. I'm starting to get more bullish on what
we could do with it and/or where we may stand in terms of potential M&A,
esp. if we get Elsevier on board. More tomorrow morning!
