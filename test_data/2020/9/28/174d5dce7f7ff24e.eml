Hi Jay, notice that I have copied Josh on this email. Let's keep going with
REPLY ALL so that Josh can be involved in the troubleshooting discussion.

Arduino Genuino boards are of very high quality and reliability but we&#39;=
ve seen problems with some of the clones. Not only do you have a Genuino, y=

e&#39;s a power supply issue so we should check a couple of things to see i=
f we can rule that in, or rule it out and look for another cause. I know of=
 two builds which had power supply issues and both of those builds exhibite=
d odd servo behavior that couldn&#39;t be easily explained- things the CrOS=
 software shouldn&#39;t really be able to direct the servo to do. At least,=
 not in the order you described.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"Ms=

 fact about servo operation: When the servo first starts to move, it can pu=
ll a decent amount of current. If the system is underpowered, or there&#39;=
s a problem with the power supply itself, this current surge can &#39;brown=
 out&#39; the Arduino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you know, =
when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid all the=
 way open then step-close it. This could explain why your lid behaves the w=
ay it does.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=

ss=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=
1) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still connect=
ed to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A power supp=
ly. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB connectio=
n and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so brownouts c=
an happen this way.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u><=
/u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">2) Make sure the powe=
r supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The Arduino only requires=
 about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up around 700 or 800 mA, =
which can brown out a power supply that&#39;s rated under 1 Amp. If there&#=
39;s any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA which is why w=
e recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure there&#39;s plenty o=
f available current.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u>=
</u>=C2=A0<u></u></p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal">3) If you are alread=
y using a power supply, and the power supply is rated for 2 Amps, maybe try=
 swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of the two power supply=
-related problems I know of, one person was using a very weak 500mA power s=
upply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp power supply that was fau=
lty and didn&#39;t supply steady current.<u></u><u></u></p></div><div><p cl=

But in summary, I got the Crowbox assembled to the point of the function te=

 two) and continues to partially open and close a few times before settling=
 into position. It doesn=E2=80=99t do this every time, but it=E2=80=99s mor=
