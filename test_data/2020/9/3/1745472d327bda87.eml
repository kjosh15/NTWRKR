Awesome, thanks for the update! A couple clarifications:

1. The next step for fundraising is getting a glossy brochure together.
Then we can create campaign materials (a sample call script, steps for
soliciting bosses, checklist for corporate / foundation grant submissions,
etc.) for parents. You were going to see if you could connect with the
parent who has marketing expertise to see if she could help me - I'd spoken
with a mom who wears a headscarf with two kids, a boy and girl around 8
y.o. or so, IIR. How should I best get in touch with them? Once that's
rolling I'm happy to work with Mary Shay and team around Race and Equity
and other fundraising efforts!

2. I'll put off the Google stuff for now, but have learned a bunch already
that might be helpful to Valerie, esp. now that you're all under the
EllaBakerSchool.org domain. For example, it's easy to share contacts
<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/2468278?hl=3Den>, to make contac=
t
groups
<https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/30970?co=3DGENIE.Platform%3DAnd=
roid&hl=3Den>,
and to email groups
<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310453?hl=3Den>. I.e., once you
have a master list of contacts they can be shared with all faculty, and
groups (for classes, PTA, etc. etc.) can be emailed directly from gmail.
Put another way, as long as google contacts is your default list of contact
info all teachers and faculty will have the same source information, and
can easily maintain, share and connect with each group.

Or, put another way, once your faculty know this and use it as such you'll
be saved a ton of headaches without having to upskill a bunch. :) Let me
know if you need any help with this, with the google parent contact form,
with integrating a spreadsheet into contacts (there's an app for that
<https://automate.io/integration/google-contacts/google-sheets>), or with
posting a version of the weekly newsletter from a google doc onto the
website!

3. Are you going to have another parent liaison mtg.? Totally happy to help
support however I'm able. The latest unique  question I'm seeing is from
parents who don't think they'll be able to participate in EB *at all* given
the virtual / hybrid requirements and are worried about losing their spots
at EB for next year, for example.

Hope you're well, and let me know if a brief call would be helpful!

All best,
Josh
