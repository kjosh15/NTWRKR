Karen,

Given your recent success with weight management I was curious if you'd be
interested in a project I'm preparing to push out. It's around a scaled
study of Continuous Glucose Monitors to see how/if they can be used to
change human behavior to improve glucose levels. If it's of interest to you
I'd love to hear what you think of my pitch deck!

All best wishes; it was so good talking to you both the other day!!

xoxo,
Josh
