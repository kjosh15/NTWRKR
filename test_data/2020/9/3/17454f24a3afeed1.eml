These are the storage locations I'm looking at - they're all the closest
ones that represent a decent range of prices. Clearly they require some
digging; one requires insurance, for example? So need to learn about all
the potential scams and how to avoid. But wanted to send you the links in
case you were curious in advance!

xoxo,
