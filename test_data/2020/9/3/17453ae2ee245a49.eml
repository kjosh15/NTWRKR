Michael,

Chris and I were discussing how IndigoMetrics is a platform that reliably
changes human behavior automatically and at scale, and how revolutionary
that is. It struck us that an academic study might do a lot towards
clarifying that to prospective clients. Do you know if your contacts at
Harvard would be interested in looking at our data and/or doing a joint
study?

All best,
Josh
