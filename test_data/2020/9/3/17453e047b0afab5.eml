<b># Structure:</b><br>
<br>
I suggested we start with 1/2 time because I believe there is significant i=
mmediate impact to be made around workforce agility, data, and considered t=
echnological leapfrogging. If we structure this as a retainer or per diem (=
plus expenses such as travel) we
 can throttle/accelerate as needed. To that end I usually build in a review=
 period quarterly to allow for adjustment.<br>
