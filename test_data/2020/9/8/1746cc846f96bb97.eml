Othinn says your son should absolutely help himself to the geodes - the
rocks that you can hammer open to find crystals inside. Note there's a
specific way to do it to avoid smashing them into powder; we mushed a few
of them before we watched a youtube video on how to do it. Also, probably
best to open them on the pavement in the courtyard as the neighbors aren't
big fans of hammering. Glad he's interested - send us a picture if he finds
anything extraordinary!!

All best wishes,
Josh
