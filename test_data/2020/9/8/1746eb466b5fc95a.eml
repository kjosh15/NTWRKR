Spent some time with Chris digging through existing action statements compi=
led from other sources and had some suggestions (attached). That said, in w=
orking through the Bechtel data a few points came up that seemed worth reve=
rting with you on:<br>
<br>
1) As you know, the initial test group was very small, which had an outsize=
d impact on our algo&#39;s ability to limit participants&#39; being asked a=
bout each other. We&#39;re excited to see how the next cohort does but want=
ed to reiterate that we expect better results
 on this front simply by virtue of size.<br>
<br>
2) In reviewing where/how to create the biggest impact with the next cohort=
 (~180 people) we agree that picking a discreet target for change is the ri=
ght approach. As we reviewed the existing question set we think you&#39;ll =
get the biggest impact by being very
 activity-specific in the language of the questions. A conversation would p=
robably be easiest to demonstrate this once you know what targets for chang=
e you&#39;d like to set for the next round; let us know when and let&#39;s =
set a time to work through the question
 sets specifically.<br>
<br>
3) Dynamically allowing people to be asked about people they&#39;re activel=
y working with: we reviewed our existing survey allocation system and can c=
ertainly support a weighting from outside sources such as Microsoft Insight=
s. Can you give us an example of the
 kind of data you could readily export and we&#39;ll see how easily we can =
support integration?<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, a quick heads up on D&amp;I; this is one area you&#39;d mentioned =
as being a target in our past calls. We&#39;re seeing a number of companies=
 who systematically overlook diversity by ignoring *types of work*. In othe=
r words, most leadership begin using upskilling
 tools with other leaders, and increasingly limit access as they go down th=
e corporate hierarchy. Beyond being bad D&amp;I thinking, this reinforces d=
isparities in advancement access, exacerbates racial and class divisions, a=
nd obfuscates cultural mismatch issues.
<br>
<br>
Because IndigoMetrics produces superior metrics, we&#39;d suggest you consi=
der using messaging around=C2=A0 equivalent measurement as a way to foster =
inclusion. If you&#39;re deciding what to measure using a full stack approa=
ch you&#39;re going to produce D&amp;I messaging simply
 by virtue of the invitation to participate, especially if you clarify that=
 the insights produced have impact across (or up and down) the organization=
. This is something we&#39;re seeing create good results in other companies=
, and it seems particularly salient
 to Bechtel given the breadth of your workforce. <br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any questions on the above and/or if I should follo=
w up on any points with anyone else!<br>
