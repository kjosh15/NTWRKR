Hi Josh,

This is interesting to hear.

Note with the four points below, I am not sure they are as much of a=20
negative as the PwC person is saying -- for me, if I moved back to=20
Iceland I would probably prefer working under my kennitala to starting=20
an ehf again, as it would remove an entire layer of bureaucracy and=20
headache, save me hours of accounting time, save me the cost of annual=20
corporate tax reporting both to the US and Iceland, and would (I=20
believe) not result in a higher tax rate (as all my income from my=20
Icelandic ehf was paid out every year anyway). All the work I performed=20
in Iceland under my ehf was taxed, and I never saw my Icelandic ehf as a=20
device for sheltering me from liability which for writers and authors=20
and the like is a relatively small concern.

Best, Ian
