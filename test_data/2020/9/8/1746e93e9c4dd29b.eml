Excellent points across the board. Doesn't help me personally, but I really
appreciate your assistance in understanding why, and also for making this
available to other freelancers like yourself who can benefit.

All best,
Josh

This is interesting to hear.<br>
<br>
Note with the four points below, I am not sure they are as much of a <br>
negative as the PwC person is saying -- for me, if I moved back to <br>
Iceland I would probably prefer working under my kennitala to starting <br>
an ehf again, as it would remove an entire layer of bureaucracy and <br>
headache, save me hours of accounting time, save me the cost of annual <br>
corporate tax reporting both to the US and Iceland, and would (I <br>
believe) not result in a higher tax rate (as all my income from my <br>
Icelandic ehf was paid out every year anyway). All the work I performed <br=

in Iceland under my ehf was taxed, and I never saw my Icelandic ehf as a <b=

and the like is a relatively small concern.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I think the key point with the the social security =

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0that, as<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0an American citizen and Icelandic resident doing in=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0social security tax. Now, you can, at least in theo=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0your own kennitala (the Icelandic equivalent of fil=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0pay social security taxes only to Iceland. You migh=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0US if you prefer that (I&#39;m not sure).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0So again, the issue there was, do you run your inco=
me through an<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Icelandic company or as Icelandic self-employment.<=
br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The issue PwC is raising is more that of whether yo=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0through the American company or as Icelandic self-e=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0They&#39;re saying that running your income through=
 the American company<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0while resident in Iceland might lead to problems wi=
th the issue of the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0company&#39;s &quot;permanent establishment.&quot; =
I&#39;m not much of an expert on that<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0concept but I might look for a second opinion. Howe=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0there is another way of resolving that problem, bes=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0kennitala.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Basically, if the American company turns out to be =
