I disagree. The US' dissolution of the respect it's earned internationally
is removing roadblocks to adequate privacy protections other countries were
previously afraid to enforce. It's clear that if someone doesn't step in
the Asian (read: China) model will dominate, so I'm actually really pleased
to see this.

Put another way, the only thing keeping the US economy afloat right now is
the top big tech firms, so they're going to do whatever they want for the
foreseeable future. If the EU feel emboldened it may act as a check or
balance as Russia and Asia rush to give them all the rope they need.

Just my $0.02, anyway!

love,
Josh
