Hello amazing people,

Man, I have so missed seeing you in 3 dimensions, having contact and
sharing space together. I feel the density of the season change, and the
precariousness of schedules and structures, but I feel a lot of hope and
excitement about what is possible and how re-orienting our lives can offer
new possibilities. It is certainly rough terrain, but worth the effort, I
believe.

Part of what continues to anchor me is making time to reconnect with what I
want to be guided by, to intentionally place it at the center of my orbit.
Most notably is making a time in my life where I can be curious, vulnerable
and honest about how I am living with and through my body, and witnessing
others do the same. This is my Authentic Movement practice, and I have
continued it online. It has been the water that flows into the cracks and
is absorbed exactly where it is needed. I come away feeling whole and
awake. I want to share and offer this practice, and I don't want to wait
for covid to be gone. I don't love the tech experience, but I have been
surprised at how nourishing this practice can be, even, yes you know it,
via zoom! If you're interested about experiencing an Authentic Movement
practice, send me a quick note by clicking here!  <weenapauly@gmail.com>

I have also cherished my session work online this summer and have so
appreciated your willingness to try it out and reap the benefits of being
together in the virtual space. We all need extra support realigning with
our center these days, and individual session work has been paramount in
reconnecting to the tools we need for navigating this new terrain. I'm here
virtually and have opened new fall hours for virtual session work, click
here to check them out.
<https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=16665096&location=Virtual%20Space>

I also wanted to give you a little sneak peek into some things I am excited
about coming down the pike. In the near future, I will be offering sessions
in a huge gorgeous studio in Brooklyn for in-person and virtual group work.
I will also be available for outside in-person movement training as well as
the blended model of outside together/virtually together with Somatic
Experiencing... stay tuned for more about that! Aaaand... I will have a new
site launching sometime soon!

I am sending you all as much ease and peace as you need for gears to shift
and new forms to reshape, and as always, sending much love and care,

Weena
