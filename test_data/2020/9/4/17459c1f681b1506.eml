Sounds potentially like a floating pin problem.

The absolute first thing to do is find out which Arduino board this person
is using. An UNO Genuino, an UNO clone, or a board that's not an UNO. That
last one is potentially the biggest problem. If someone decides to change
the logical pin numbers in the code to accommodate a board that's
configured differently than an UNO, they may have selected pins which do
not offer the Arduino's built-in INPUT_PULLUP functionality which could
cause the switches to behave oddly.

Can you find out which board the person is using? Meantime I'll think up
some ideas for troubleshooting.
