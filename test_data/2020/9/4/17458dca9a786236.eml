Hulda, below is an email I'd like to send to Gustavo about what we need
packed. I suggest we both get on the call with him Monday to do a video
walkthrough and see what we're forgetting / can leave off the list.

Separately, how do you feel about asking Weena and Matt to take our safe
and the green metal file folder?

xoxo,
Josh

Gustavo,

We've been working on the packing list for our apartment. At present we're
waiting until next week to see what arrived along with our winter clothes;
based on that we may want to have some stuff packed up for a second
shipment. Otherwise, <LINK>this spreadsheet</LINK> ought to summarize what
needs to get packed for storage.

As an overview, it's basically everything excluding furniture, plants, and
consumables in the:

- bathroom cabinet
- closet by the front door
- dining room
- living room (except the rags, tools, and plastic storage boxes)
- main bedroom (except for in the big plastic bins stacked on the floor of
the closet, the push stroller in the other closet, or the planting supplies=
)
- And everything you're not using in the kitchen or boy's rooms except for
towels or food.

In other words, day-to-day stuff you need to run a regular life should stay
- stuff like furniture, towels, bed linens, food, etc. But all the other
stuff; books, mementos, clothes, pictures, etc. needs to get put in
storage. Good news is that should give you a lot more space to run around
in!!

Let's talk this through on our call Monday; I think that with Video it'll
be a lot easier to say "yeah, don't worry about those art supplies" or "oh
geez, I forgot about those towels, just leave them" etc.! We can decide how
many boxes you think we should order at the same time.

Separately, I've reached out to the landlord to schedule a call. Given the
recent extension on the eviction moratorium I suspect they'll be more
willing to negotiate.

Thanks again for taking this on, Gustavo!

All best,
Josh
