Thanks so much, Mom! Love seeing this old font; I really remember that
cookbook. Out of curiosity, why do you suggest avoiding organic apricots??

The apricot crescents are made out of classic sweet dough so the first phot=
o shows both those recipes.=C2=A0 The following photos show larger images o=
f the recipes.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I didn=E2=80=99t enlarge the classic sweet dough=
 final instructions above the crescent recipe but you can get that from the=
 first photo. I usually make one batch of the classic sweet dough, and afte=
r it is punched down, use the whole batch=C2=A0 to make 6 apricot crescents=
.=C2=A0 Each 1/3 of the classic sweet dough will make 2 apricot crescents.=
=C2=A0 They freeze great and we would usually eat at least a couple and giv=
e away the rest.=C2=A0 The apricot filling recipe is under the apricot cres=
cent recipe and makes enough filling for 3 crescents.=C2=A0 I would double =
the filling recipe when I did 6 crescents.=C2=A0 The filling is good on toa=
st if you have extra. I=E2=80=99ll send you a picture of what the crescent =
is supposed to look like.=C2=A0 It is the one on the lower left.<br>
<br>
If you would rather make a smaller number of crescents I have other bread r=
ecipes that would use the remainder of the classic sweet dough.<br>
