Understood; I'm a little disappointed the Grid service is so less
performant than the Dedicated Virtual (if that's what turns out to be the
case), but am very curious to see if that and/or the PHP upgrade improves
things.

For reference, the MT knowledge base article on moving from Grid to DV:
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204644950/migrate-to-a-dv-f=
rom-a-grid

At present I have administrative access through my own Grid login. To add
another or change administrative access, Matan would need to log in to his
owner's account and set it directly. For reference on roles:
https://mediatemple.net/community/products/all/204643980/account-center-con=
tact-roles

Let me know how else I can help!
