Hi- have you mailed this out yet? The information is correct and vital. I
like the indication that a Voltaic bank is a bit costly, but less than an
inline GFCI switch for an extension cord, thus highlighting the tradeoff.

I would reword the P.S. message just a bit. Make sure you name Voltaic in
that message and possibly even link to a couple of products (if you don't
have a problem driving traffic directly to a vendor). Fact is, it's the
only bank we know of right now that can run a low-current device for a long
time.

Mainly, I'm just suggesting we find a very clear way to say that we
understand the temptation to believe that all power bank devices are
essentially equal but there is in fact a critical feature that is rare and
right now we only know of one bank that offers it.

I'll take some time and see if anyone else has introduced power banks with
no auto-shutoff. This feature is most popular among photographers who wish
to set up long-term time-lapse camera rigs so it's possible someone else
has decided to get into that game.

Also, I'll prepare simple schematics this weeked and a parts list for a
buck convertor that can be used to bring 12 volts down to 5. This will let
people consider all sorts of rechargeable power sources: LiPo packs, car
batteries, UPS batteries, ATV batteries, etc.

Shit, I have to run and I was still editing this message- let me know if
you wish to discuss it more. I think I captured my thoughts here.

Hope it's helpful.

Hope you and your family are well.

-Steve
