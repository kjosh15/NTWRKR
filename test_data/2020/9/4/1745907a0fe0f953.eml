Thanks so much for this! It arrived just as I was starting to google around
for those links.

I agree with Nils, except that it's very hard to penetrate Apple and I
don't know that they're as likely to deploy immediately as a J&J or Novo
Nordisk - Apple is juggling a much larger, less health-oriented portfolio
of services and tend to be very selective about hardware (i.e., they don't
do partnerships unless aiming at M&A - Beats is a great example.) Do you
disagree?

No target list yet; would love to talk to you about how to qualify said
targets!!

I'll revert on your deck changes ASAP; thanks again!

best,
Josh
