Sorry, meant to follow up; I had a behaviour similar to what you described 
when I had screwed the disk down too tightly and it was affecting how the 
servo turned, but if you see the problem without the disk then I don't have 
many ideas! 

Have you tried detaching the two switches?  The pins that control the coin 
detector are odd, they are the interrupt detector pins and, betraying my 
hazy knowledge and magical thinking when it comes to electronics, in my box 
I had some problem with activity in one of the lid switches "bleeding over" 
into the interrupt detector, so I remapped those to non-adjacent pins in 
the code and it worked after that, I mean for while, a seagull has since 
destroyed my coin channel, but that's another problem!

So, you have probably tried this but I would suggest unplugging both 
switches and seeing if mode 3 works.
