Thanks again for the intro to August; the folks at PwC have been helpful.
Unfortunately I think I've pushed them past their comfort zone: do you know
anything about the new social security totalization agreement legislation:

https://www.ssa.gov/international/Agreement_Texts/iceland.html

? I've asked PwC but their read is that it's only for temporary workers
from the US, whereas one of the primary persons involved in getting it
passed explained that it makes it less necessary for self-employed American
citizens living in Iceland to start an Icelandic company by allowing them
to do business under their own Kennitala without that income becoming
subject to American self-employment tax. I.e., it should be possible to get
a "certificate of coverage" from the Icelandic authorities (probably
Tryggingastofnun) confirming that the self-employed American is paying into
the Icelandic social security system to be submitted with the American tax
return.

Curious who might be better able to advise on this as I think it means that
I either don't need to make a local Icelandic company to accept payment
through, or that I can do so more cheaply. Do you have any advice?

Much obliged,
Josh
