Ian,

Do you know anyone in Iceland who knows more about the social security
totalization agreement? My contact at PwC here has suggested that I still
need an Icelandic company (which they'd like to sell me the service to set
up), and infers that the agreement is only for temporary workers from the
US:

"Based on the time you will be living in Iceland and working here, you
would always have to pay payroll tax in Iceland and most likely your US
company would be considered to have a permanent establishment in Iceland
and therefore would be taxable here. The agreement applies to individuals
that are sent temporarily to work outside of the US and due to the
agreement they can pay lower social security in the country they work in
(social security in Iceland is 6,35% but would be lowered to 0,425% based
on the mentioned agreement)"

Finally, feel free to tell me I'm on my own here; I'm hardly paying you for
your expert advice on all this and I know you're busy with your existing
business in Germany!! I hope you and your family are doing well.

All best wishes,
Josh
