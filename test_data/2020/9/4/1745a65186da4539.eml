I know! I really thought we were going to have croutons and nothing else
off of this. :) There are three flours you can buy here; this is the whole
wheat one.

Interestingly, the dough was very wet and sticky throughout - I neglected
to reduce the hydration ratio in the initial flour soak - but it
somehow bounced back in the oven. I think that a) not using water in the
oven (so no steam), and b) not cutting the loaf both helped.

Anyway, it was a big hit! Next time I'll try reducing the hydration and see
if I can't get a more normal looking dough.

Love,
Josh
