Had another call w/ Matt that clarified things significantly. One piece of
this is that he has a relationship with a production exec at Disney + as
well as at a few different institutions that he think would find this very
interesting.

The idea as I understand it is primarily around using Iceland as a "voice"
for asking the question of what people are doing to address climate change.
He's aiming squarely at the youth market, which is increasingly disaffected
by climate change messaging, and looking to use surreal visuals and
fantastical ideas to make the topic more engaging.

Practically this looks like taking a historical Icelandic figure (such as
Hallger=C3=B0ur Langbr=C3=B3k) and having her host the show. Each episode w=
ould see
her going somewhere in the world where someone is making an impact on the
climate change issue and interviewing them about what they're doing and why
it matters. That part is pretty straight forward, even formulaic, which is
a virtue when making content for youth, who like the repetition.

A possible new wrinkle I wanted to add was to use GPT-3, a recently lauded
AI advance, to ask the questions. This new technology is blowing minds in
that you can submit a canon of text and then ask it to produce content that
appears written by the human who wrote the text.

For purposes of this series I would want to submit the sagas to GPT-3 and
then have it produce a dialogue of questions about the climate issues or
technologies or movements being discussed. I personally love this because
it is taking something very historical, cultural, and historically nuanced
- the sagas and the Icelandic history and culture they evoke - as
understood by something very new - the alien, disturbingly human AI. The
goal is to curate the questions and pose them as being asked by Iceland
itself,  For reference, see:

Billie Eilish gets interviewed by a robot:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DK0c94ghBS4A

In any case Matt really wants to get Bjork involved because she only does
surreal stuff and thought she'd love the idea of using that element to make
climate change engaging and relatable. In any case positioning this as
coming FROM Iceland is an interesting conceit. And above all it appears
there is a gap in the market and funding available for this sort of
content.

Thoughts?
