Since everyone went virtual the signal to noise ratio has fallen off a =
cliff. I wanted to try an old-fashioned concept and actually connect =
directly: what are you up to these days, and how can I help?

Below are my current projects, or set a time(https://josh.is/scheduling) =
and let's chat!=20
Looking forward,

Current Projects:
=20
IndigoMetrics(http://www.indigometrics.com/IndigoMetrics_Overview.pdf); an =
AI platform for autonomously managing behavior and beliefs in employees. =
Super useful if you've got staff that are now remote!=20
Continuous Glucose Monitor Testing(https://docs.google.=
com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g); a project=
 to understand how to use physically embedded sensors to reduce the health =
impacts of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (and hence Covid!)=20
Professional Services(http://www.josh.is): as ever, I continue to work with=
 senior leaders and teams on technology strategy and new innovation / =
product development.

P.S. If you're interested in the theory behind this =
outreach, there is a whitepaper here(https://docs.google.=
com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0-BG_0/edit?=
usp=3Dsharing).
