Well played, you! We made it to Iceland in mid-June, and while we only
decided to stay in mid-July we're feeling pretty lucky ourselves. They had
8 cases in the country yesterday and all models predict they get down to
zero by October.

+1 on the career move; was mid-transition when the pandemic hit, but the
strategy has basically held since. Happy to compare notes if you're
interested; I decided against people managing roles earlier on but am
otherwise also doing mostly consulting/advising/retainer work.

And yes, come to Iceland. It's amazing! :)

All best,
Josh
