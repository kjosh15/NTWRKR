Hi Chris,

Sorry, I was out of the office on Friday, Yes - would be happy to do a test
review so go ahead and kick that off. I'll log in and see how everything
looks.

As far as timing, if all work out with the test and gets squared away this
week, we can announce at our all agency meeting Monday morning 9/21 and
launch with the pilot groups on Tuesday 9/22. Exciting!
