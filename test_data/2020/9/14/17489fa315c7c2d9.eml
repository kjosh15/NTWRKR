when it comes to electronics, in my box I had some problem with activity in=
 one of the lid switches &quot;bleeding over&quot; into the interrupt detec=

 but would instead wait just a second or two before closing halfway, openin=

is my first project of this sort so I&#39;m not sure how to troubleshoot. T=
