Thank you so much - this is extremely useful!! At this point I think it's a
matter of capital; I'm used to US fees, where it would cost ~$25.00 and 30
minutes to create a new Delaware LLC... So I may have to wait until I've
secured a contract and made the capital to invest in creating the LLC. Lots
to consider.

Apologies for the slow reply; we all decided to share a cold towards the
end of last week and I had to take my turn in bed sniffling...

Good news is we're all better now; let us know when you might be available
for breakfast, a walk, or what-have-you.

All best,
Josh

Things here are going well; the boys are doing well at their new school and=
 I&#39;m busy negotiating some new contracts. Which leads me to two questio=
ns:<br>
<br>
1. As part of your legal work do you ever broker the sale of Icelandic LLCs=
 as operating instruments? I&#39;ve been working with PWC to figure out how=
 to manage my taxes, and they suggested creating an LLC to accept contract =
income here in Iceland. I was told there
 is a &quot;word of mouth&quot; market for these instruments (as buying one=
 which is no longer being used may be cheaper than creating a new one) and =
was curious if you have any insight.
<br>
<br>
2. Are you and your wife available for a walk sometime? Would be great to c=
atch up and compare notes on the fall in Iceland!<br>
<br>
