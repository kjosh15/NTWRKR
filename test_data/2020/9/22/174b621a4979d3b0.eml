Gustavo,

Wanted to reiterate the strategy and ask about what you think you can do if
we end up with the landlord challenging us. To summarize, we're looking at
two outcomes:

1) The landlord cashes our check and we go to a month-to-month strategy. In
this case:
- We'll reserve a storage space and you'll get the stuff you're not using
packed and stored by the end of October.
- You'll either a) get the rest of our stuff packed and stored by the end
of Dec./before you move out, or b) work out what to keep longer-term
staying at ours into the new year.

2) The landlord *doesn't* cash our check and either threatens eviction or
submits a notice to quit the premises. Either way we submit an eviction
moratorium request. We then either negotiate terms, or have to vacate by
the end of October.

In the second case we'd have to figure out how to get all our stuff out of
there ASAP. What would you be comfortable committing to in terms of packing
and storing our things if it comes to that? Our priority is the Store Now
list so we know what is in which box in case we need to ship things over
piecemeal. In both cases we're still planning for you to pay only the $500
+ utilities.

Obviously we're hoping for the month to month situation, but wanted to have
contingency plans in place otherwise. Thanks for engaging in all this,
despite the crazy uncertainty!!

All best,
Josh
