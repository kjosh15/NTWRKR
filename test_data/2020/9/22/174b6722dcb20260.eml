Hi, Josh! Love to catch up, compare notes, and ... whatever. Lots going =
on in our futures, I'm sure.

I'm adding Joyce, who is still my alpha collaborator. She still operates =
both our calendars.

While we still have the New York apartment, we headed to the West Coast =
in March (on United's last full flight from EWR to LAX), best to isolate =
ourselves. At the moment we're in Los Angeles watching our version of =
Iceland's volcanoes: massive wildfires clouding the skies and dusting =
the landscape with ash. Wild.

Talk soon,

Doc

I was wondering if you'd be game to catch up. We moved to Iceland and =
the view of the innovation landscape straddling the US and EU is =
bizarre. Let me know if you have a second to catch up and compare notes!
