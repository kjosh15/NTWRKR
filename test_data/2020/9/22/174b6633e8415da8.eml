</div><div><div>I still remember when it was the Left who had more fun. It =
wasn=E2=80=99t just that they were younger and had better hair, music, and =
drugs (though all of that certainly helped); it was that the Left was fabul=
ously irreverent. Whether nominating a pig for president, or raining dollar=

/div><div><br></div><div>Trump=E2=80=99s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960=
s counterculture at its most effective, when satirists and pranksters began=
 applying some of the principles of postmodern art to protest. At its core,=
 postmodernism was about rejecting big, overarching ideologies. If we could=
 deconstruct these top-down narratives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=
=94the formerly passive spectators=E2=80=94could have as much power over th=
e perception of reality as the authorities broadcasting it. The trick was s=

elief systems, revealing accepted truths as arbitrary illusions.=C2=A0</div=
><div><br></div><div>Although Europeans have understood the power of postmo=
dernism since the Dadaists, in America it was probably counterculture write=
r Paul Krassner who first weaponized the idea, publishing the first intenti=
onally =E2=80=9Cfake news=E2=80=9D story in his satirical magazine The Real=
ist. Meant as an antidote to the anodyne treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=

owing up the next night in a chroma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9C=

ifully superimposing anti-Trump imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dre=

t Trump=E2=80=99s rhetorical pyrotechnics. =C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>=
Did the Trumps really mean to accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doe=

eize the power of all this semiotic play because the left has relinquished =
it. In part, it=E2=80=99s because the Left is now in the position of the to=

l rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstrea=
m society accepted=E2=80=94at least the principle=E2=80=94that women, peopl=

>Meanwhile, the artsy cheekiness of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went fr=
om the streets of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia. There, it=
 became the dead serious discipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an ear=
nest analysis of the way language and culture are controlled by those in po=
wer. In deconstructing the way the perceptions, labels, and language of a p=
owerful group can be used to limit what seems possible for a less powerful =
one, they concluded that words can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at t=

 MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad =

 worked in the prior media era, when all we could really do is shout back a=
t the TV screen. Interpretation and deconstruction are great for broadcast =
audiences. But we=E2=80=99re not in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=
=80=99re participants in a digital media environment. We=E2=80=99re not jus=

=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold,=
 we=E2=80=99ve gone from command and control to cybernetics. Our relationsh=

he public is responding to the President, or if the President is responding=
 to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response t=
o white abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black protest=
s, leading to more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer=
 a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is responsible. =
The feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible deniability. The craz=

e whether he&#39;s a victim, a terrorist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div=
