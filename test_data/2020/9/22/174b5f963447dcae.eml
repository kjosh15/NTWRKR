How was it getting back *in* to Iceland? Can only imagine what the rest of
the trip was like. One would hope that the global travel apparatus would
take a step forward in light of its potential imminent demise, but I take
it that's not yet the case.

The quote's for my record of past work; I want to include more design
elements in my cases and the IDEO (and your) name carries a lot of weight.
I'll send you a link when it's together to make sure you're comfortable
with it.

Good to hear about Iceland, and esp. that PM gets it. Let me know
when/where/how I could add some tech expertise: to date the tech sector has
understood a) programming, b) crypto, and c) nothing else. Sounds like
you're on the right track!

godspeed,
Josh
