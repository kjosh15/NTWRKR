Well, that's comforting. Nothing says "we care" like offering to pay for
your funeral if you catch a deadly virus on their transport. One wonders
how that particular marketing meeting went...

BTW, your quote was used thusly:

###
=E2=80=9CTechnology is critical to any organization, but even more so in a =
design
firm that serves customers across every segment and in markets across the
globe. Josh helped us pull together a comprehensive document with deep
technical understanding and strong growth benchmarks that gave us the
framework we needed to move forward.=E2=80=9C
=E2=80=93 Paul Bennett, IDEO=E2=80=99s Chief Creative Officer

IDEO NY needed a technology strategy to take into account existing
resources globally and a shifting market for technology locally. Through
company-wide stakeholder interviews and a rigorous strategic framework Josh
was able to deliver a flexible plan for addressing both in tandem and in
response to actual growth.
###

Invigorating stuff, I know. Keep me posted on the Iceland effort - I'm
delivering a talk to Bifrost's entrepreneurial cohort later this week so
may have more feedback on what they responded to. Might be worthwhile to
pull their startup marketing into the creative industry narrative.

best,
Josh

Busy of course with COVID but a real sense that they need to invest in
building a portfolio with more depth and less obvious stuff like tourism.
