We moved to Iceland, at least for the interim. That plus my seat as
spectator to the global business elite and it's a weird, weird vantage
point. Curious how things look from LA. Want to do a brief call to catch
up, compare notes, and potentially conspire? I've got a project to use AI
to interview climate deniers for a leading comedian...

All best,
Josh
