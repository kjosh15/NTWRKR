Got some feedback that we could use more references and a brief storyboard
before sharing any ideas with Bj=C3=B6rk's management. Of especial interest=
 is
feedback on format: length, potential buyer, that this is for streaming /
TV, etc.

Are those easy to answer/add so we can get this in front of Bj=C3=B6rk's te=
am?
