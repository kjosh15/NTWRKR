Fantastic work, Michelle!! Only two things I would add:

a) Call to action on the last page; this could be as generic as "contact us
to get involved" or as specific as "Contact us to donate." Either way it
should have some stirring text around the importance of Ella Baker
(especially in the pandemic) and the need for greater support outside of
the DOE.

b) Include an email address. Again, if we're being donation-specific this
should be "donate@ellabakerschool.org" and if not just "info@"

Betsy, do you have any feeling which way this should go?

Thanks, all!!!
