Hi Betsy and Josh,

My suggestion is, sit with the pdf. I think Josh should send his edits =
to Betsy. Betsy see if you agree with Josh=E2=80=99s edits, if you do, =
add them to yours. If it=E2=80=99s easier, we may do it together during =
a working session. I can share my screen with you.=20

But I think there will still be tweaks, so while you are reviewing the =
text, if you have more images please email them to me.

Thanks,
Michelle
