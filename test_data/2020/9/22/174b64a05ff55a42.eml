How are you doing out there? Thought I'd ping you and see if you're game to
compare notes; we moved to Iceland and are likely to wait out the rest of
the school year here. Got a couple projects going with the film industry
here (you ought to come and shoot something!!) and otherwise the usual
panoply of odd things. Let me know if you're up for a call, and otherwise
I'll circle back in a quarter or so!

All best to you and the family,
Josh
