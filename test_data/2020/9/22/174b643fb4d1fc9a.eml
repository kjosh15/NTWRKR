We moved to Iceland, and the view of the EU/US innovation landscape is
bizarre. I'm still mostly spending my time on retainer to senior execs but
their understanding of the opportunity space is weirder than ever. Do you
have time to catch up and compare notes? Nothing specific on the agenda
beyond the fact that being fully virtualized has caused me to double down
on only spending zoom time with decent human beings!

All best to you and yours,
Josh
