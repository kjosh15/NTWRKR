Getting back in was OK, multiple COVID tests, one in the Emirates to even
get on the plane, (almost) a second in Copenhagen in transit which I
somehow avoided, and two here, with quarantine in the middle. Sigh.
Emirates now pays for your funeral if you die because of contacting the
virus on their plane tho

The quote's for my record of past work; I want to include more design

I'll send you a link when it's together to make sure you're comfortable
with it.

Good to hear about Iceland, and esp. that PM gets it. Let me know
when/where/how I could add some tech expertise: to date the tech sector has
understood a) programming, b) crypto, and c) nothing else. Sounds like
you're on the right track!

godspeed,
