It's been a minute; as we hit our stride in the middle of the pandemic I
was wondering if you'd be game to catch up. We moved to Iceland and the
view of the innovation landscape straddling the US and EU is bizarre. Let
me know if you have a second to catch up and compare notes!

All best wishes,
Josh
