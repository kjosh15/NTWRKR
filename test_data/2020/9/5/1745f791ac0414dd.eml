Joshua,
   Congratulations! It took me years to get where you are already. Perhaps h=
aving a mentor helped =F0=9F=99=84?
   Seriously,  you seem to now have good control of your processes. Are you s=
till using the starter I sent you?  One thing I observe that might help you i=
s, make your scores deeper. Further, if you want the classic =E2=80=9Cear=E2=
=80=9D cut the scores at about 45 degrees to the surface of the loaf. I make=
 my scores between 1 and 2 cm deep (1/4 to 1/2 inch).
   You mentioned earlier that you weren=E2=80=99t adding water/steam to the o=
ven during the first 20 minutes. This really is important to keep the dough s=
oft during the first part of cooking to allow for maximum rise before the lo=
af forms a crust. The scoring is also to allow for rise in the bread. Oh - d=
o remember to remove the water after the 1st 20 minutes.=20
   Keep up the good work.=20

Love,
DAD
