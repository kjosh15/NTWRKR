Josh,

Thanks for contacting (mt) Media Temple!

We are not seeing any reported outages for your Grid server. What you are seeing is most likely false positives being reported by Jetpack. 

Currently as it is Jetpack reports the site as being down if it does not load within 10 seconds. 

You can read about that from the plugin author here:
https://wordpress.org/support/topic/jetpack-monitor-says-site-down-its-not/

Right now when I run a speed check on your site it loads in 9.5 seconds which is right on the verge of being considered "down" by Jetpack. 

https://gtmetrix.com/reports/josh.is/f1pkmxIw 

Also most of the content on your site is currently not loading from (mt) Media Temple servers through the Jetpack photon module. 

I checked the amount of calls per page load that your site is making and here are the top results:

    276 w3-total-cache
    306 contact-form-7
    988 jetpack
   1235 advanced-custom-fields
  15443 neuron-core-bifrost

I also checked the speed of the server itself and it loaded a phpinfo page in .8 seconds 
https://gtmetrix.com/reports/josh.is/Efs7P0il

I would suggest that you optimize your website and it's plugins, run some speed test on the site after deactivating your plugins and then checking to see how individual plugins can slow your site down. You may also want to look at a different monitoring service such as Pingdom.

If you have questions about the information within this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services, please feel free to contact us at any time. We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,

Brandon B.
