Gustavo,

Thanks again for the call yesterday; we can't tell you how much it means to
us to know someone we trust is helping our physical things get packed away
safely.

A few next steps:

1. We've updated the stuff list
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QpF90SyOXPL6G0g3F_l6Aaytz-OvypjnTx60zAZ5qQ/edit?usp=sharing>
and included a packing protocol. Take a look and let us know if you have
any questions.

2. There is a space heater in the closet facing the window in the primary
bedroom. You likely won't need it - we usually keep at least one window
cracked all winter - but just in case the boiler goes out or something
weird happens we wanted to make sure you know where to find it.

3. Can you take a high-res picture of the english kid's books in the living
room and send it to me? We realized there were probably plenty of books
there that Etukai might like and  that we don't need right away... and that
there are probably several I'd forgotten about which my youngest could
benefit from in the near term.

4. I moved up the rent payment to the 20th; it'll arrive 3-5 days later.
Hopefully I'll hear from the landlord before then, but wanted to keep you
appraised of the steps we're taking.

I think that's it for now. Let us know what else we can do to help, and I
hope you're all settling in!!

All best,
Josh
