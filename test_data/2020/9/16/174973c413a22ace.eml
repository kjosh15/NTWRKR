Wanted to check back in with you now that I've built up a deck
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkelWdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=sharing>
on the project we discussed. Was really curious:

1. how you felt it could be improved,
2. if you thought it was viable for funding by a J&J or similar big company,
3. if you were interested.

Hope you're well,
Josh
