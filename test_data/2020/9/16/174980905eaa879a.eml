Joshua,

You are getting it done!=20

As I learned to make bread I found it very interesting/frustrating how a rec=
ipe with 3 ingredients plus yeast (or, in the case of sourdough, a culture) c=
an turn out so very differently with only slight changes in even just one ar=
ea (flour type, hydration, proof timing, oven humidity, cooking temp, et cet=
era). You seem to be getting a handle on controlling these parameters rather=
 quickly. I think that your making bread regularly/often is a help in learni=
ng as you have a good recall of what you did previously, which helps in unde=
rstanding the effect of any change - whether made intentionally by you or th=
at occurred due to an oversight.=20

Keep up the good work.  BTW, you can take some of your unused starter, sprea=
d it on parchment paper (or wax paper or aluminum foil if no parchment paper=
 is available) and let it dry. When dried, break it up and store it in a zip=
lock bag in case you loose your active starter.=20

Love,
DAD
