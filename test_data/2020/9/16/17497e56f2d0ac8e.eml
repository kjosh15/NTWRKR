Lots happening this week.

1. The Social Dilemma, a new Netflix documentary came out, making many of
the arguments that people like me, Sherry Turkle, Cliff Nass, Howard
Rheingold, Andrew Keen, Evgeny Morozov, Astra Taylor, Richard Barbrook,
Nick Carr, Mark Bauerlain, and even Raffi have been making about the impact
of social media manipulation on our psyche and society for many years. Only
in the movie, it's the tech guys who actually made these platforms who are
blowing the whistle on their own previous misdeeds.

I'm getting lots of very supportive email from people who recognize our
words and metaphors coming out of the mouths of the contrite tech
developers - but I think it's important we don't get possessive about our
work. This is not about getting credit, but saving our very society.

Our bigger goal should be to try to get some of these new tech reformers to
divest from their holdings in Facebook, Google, and the other companies
aiming at our brainstems. If, like they're saying, these companies are as
big an existential threat to humanity as climate change, then it doesn't
make sense to have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars invested in
them. It's like holding stock in cigarette or oil companies. We can't
profit off the harm.

I've got a monologue about this that opens the new Team Human show
<https://teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-165-helen-pluckrose-and-james-lindsay-tow=
ard-justice-for-all/>,
with a couple of highly controversial guests, the authors of *Cynical
Theories*, Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay.

2. I have a new big piece in GEN on Medium. You can read it online here
<https://gen.medium.com/the-gop-stole-satire-from-the-left-6f373b8e5bad>,
or I have pasted it below.

I'll write again in the next week or so with some upcoming stuff and
thoughts about where we are right now as a society. I don't think this
whole thing has to fall apart, but it could. Accepting that possibility
doesn't have to trigger fear; it can also inspire new resolve.


*THIS IS NOT A DRESS*
*How the Right Stole Operation Mindfuck from the Left*

I still remember when it was the Left who had more fun. It wasn=E2=80=99t j=
ust that
they were younger and had better hair, music, and drugs (though all of that
certainly helped); it was that the Left was fabulously irreverent. Whether
nominating a pig for president, or raining dollar bills on the New York
Stock Exchange, these were pranksters and media activists who tweaked their
noses at authority and undermined the foundations of consensus society.

Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump and QAnon who have taken on that countercultural =
mantle,
using the media available at their disposal to destabilize fact-based
reality and promote conspiracy theories=E2=80=94and to do it all so cheekil=
y that
we can=E2=80=99t even tell if they actually believe what they=E2=80=99re sa=
ying.

Trump=E2=80=99s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s counterculture at its m=
ost
effective, when satirists and pranksters began applying some of the
principles of postmodern art to protest. At its core, postmodernism was
about rejecting big, overarching ideologies. If we could deconstruct these
top-down narratives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the formerly pass=
ive
spectators=E2=80=94could have as much power over the perception of reality =
as the
authorities broadcasting it. The trick was simply to sow doubt by enacting
stunts that make people question their own belief systems, revealing
accepted truths as arbitrary illusions.

Although Europeans have understood the power of postmodernism since the
Dadaists, in America it was probably counterculture writer Paul Krassner
who first weaponized the idea, publishing the first intentionally =E2=80=9C=
fake
news=E2=80=9D story in his satirical magazine The Realist. Meant as an anti=
dote to
the anodyne treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s assassination by mainstr=
eam
books and articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece claimed that while the preside=
nt=E2=80=99s
body was being transported on Air Force One, Jackie Kennedy walked in
Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the exit wound in her husband=E2=80=99s=
 skull.
Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known crudity and lust for power, the myth gained =
traction
as both news and metaphor.

Likewise, we saw Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the Yippies declaring in
1967 that they were =E2=80=9Cnow in the business of wholesale disruption an=
d
widespread resistance and dislocation of the American society,=E2=80=9D and=
 embark
on a project to encircle the Pentagon in order to levitate it and exorcise
it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg explained, =E2=80=9CThe Pentagon was symbol=
ically
levitated in people=E2=80=99s minds in the sense that=E2=80=A6the authority=
 of the Pentagon
psychologically was dissolved.=E2=80=9D

Robert Anton Wilson eventually claimed all of this activity as part of
=E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the collective countercultural=
 effort to destabilize
myth surrounding the American Dream. What made these performative, po-mo
protests work so well was that they were cheeky. While their ultimate
intentions were of existential importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War, r=
ace
murder, and economic oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take themselves=
 seriously at
all. This is part of what made them so powerful. How do you fight a clown?

Today, it=E2=80=99s the orange man playing the part of the clown, with QAno=
n as his
Yippie minions, pranking the public with fake news and metaphorical stunts
that work whether or not they=E2=80=99re taken seriously. In fact, the less=
 serious
they seem, the more wiggle room they create=E2=80=94for confusion in the au=
dience,
and denial by the prankster.

The Republican National Convention may have been the most blatant
celebration of authoritarianism in American history, but it was also
postmodern theater. An appearance by a couple whose sole qualification for
speaking was having waved guns at BLM protestors marching by their home;
Melania Trump dressed in a military-themed outfit almost identical to
Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania following up the next night in a chroma-key green=
 dress,
as if to say =E2=80=9Cproject onto me whatever you want=E2=80=9D; and Trump=
 himself
responding to accusations that it was illegal to use the Rose Garden for a
campaign by acknowledging his White House backdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=
=E2=80=99re here,
they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D

The progressive Twitterverse responded to each taunt with greater outrage,
posting side-by-side comparisons of Melania=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=
=E2=80=99s,
scoffing at Trump=E2=80=99s use of the White House as a set piece, and duti=
fully
superimposing anti-Trump imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dress. Tri=
ggered,
provoked, and destabilized, the Left loses touch with whatever issues it
may hold dear, drawn instead into a frenzy of speculation about Trump=E2=80=
=99s
rhetorical pyrotechnics.

Did the Trumps really mean to accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It
doesn=E2=80=99t matter, as long as we obsess over trying to figure it out. =
This is
the desired effect=E2=80=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda pranksterism=
. As Walter
Lippmann, the founder of the field of public relations, explained back in
the 1920s: the object of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpseudo environmen=
t=E2=80=9D
between people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputting pictures into their h=
eads.=E2=80=9D
People=E2=80=99s imaginations take care of the rest.

Trump has been able to seize the power of all this semiotic play because
the left has relinquished it. In part, it=E2=80=99s because the Left is now=
 in the
position of the top-down broadcasters, and Trump has assumed the mantle of
the countercultural rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the cultu=
re wars.
Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94at least the principle=E2=80=94that wom=
en, people of
color, LGBTQ, and every intersectional group deserves equal rights. But
this put the Left on defense, always on alert for language and imagery that
violated its hard-won cultural victories.

Meanwhile, the artsy cheekiness of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went
from the streets of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia. There,
it became the dead serious discipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an e=
arnest
analysis of the way language and culture are controlled by those in power.
In deconstructing the way the perceptions, labels, and language of a
powerful group can be used to limit what seems possible for a less powerful
one, they concluded that words can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at t=
he heart
of today=E2=80=99s identity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99s high =
sensitivity to
labels, language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an adversary =
willing
to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achilles=
=E2=80=99 heel.

Trump certainly sees it that way, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to del=
iver a
daily dose of language and imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN,
MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad
enough, but he=E2=80=99s also playing the spoilsport at the very same time,=
 winking
and nudging at the preposterousness of the game itself, as if to say, You
saw a military dress on Melania at the RNC? What do you project tonight
onto her chromakey gown? It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously r=
ealizes
any of this at all. Whether the result of strategy or intuition, it works.

Critical theory and the linguistic sensitivity it engendered doesn=E2=80=99=
t seem
to be serving us very well as we attempt to fight back against the
post-modern antics of Trump and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99s the alt-rig=
ht using
pranksterism to promote fascism, and the formerly cheeky Left now stranded
in the hall of mirrors it once created to destabilize the Old Guard. Word
play and mindfuckery are great tools for revolution, but terrible ones for
building consensus or sustainable civics. They can distract us from the
real conditions on the ground, and the facts on which our best arguments
rest.

I don=E2=80=99t even think this was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. Ther=
e=E2=80=99s more at play
here than an academic theory run aground on the shoals of the real world.
It=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only really worked in the prior media=
 era,
when all we could really do is shout back at the TV screen. Interpretation
and deconstruction are great for broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re not=
 in a
spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=99re participants in a digital media
environment. We=E2=80=99re not just hearing and watching things; our respon=
ses
become part of the story.

As computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99ve gone from comm=
and and
control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power is more like a feedback
loop, where everything is both the cause and effect of everything else.
It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the public is responding to the Pr=
esident,
or if the President is responding to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.  B=
LM
protests are a response to white abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered
response to Black protests, leading to more abuse, and then more protests.
There=E2=80=99s no longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and =
everyone is
responsible. The feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible
deniability. The crazy 17-year-old is on the streets with a rifle, and
people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he's a victim, a terrorist, or both.

These feedback loops are what spun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the
current culture war, only now, fully divorced from conditions on the ground
or class consciousness. It=E2=80=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twi=
tter and cable TV, in
symbolism, framing, and word choice. But there's an actual way things are,
which gets thrown out in the process. These culture wars concede reality
itself. No one has any ground for discussion or engagement. And this is
largely social media's fault, in that we accept our algorithmically derived
profiles as some measure of who we are.

But when we pull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going on here, we see a wh=
ole
bunch of poor, disempowered people of every color being programmed by
social media to fight against one another instead of against their mutual
oppressors. And sure, they can each see how the other side is being
manipulated=E2=80=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, are being r=
adicalized the
same way.

As this all spins out of control, we find ourselves on the brink of what a
full third of Americans believe may even become a civil war. People
actually shooting each other in the streets based on crazy ass fake
bullshit=E2=80=94and giving more ammunition to a President and media that b=
oth
thrive off this artificial and unnecessary conflict. Chaos and violence
work in their favor=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what the administration says out=
 loud=E2=80=94because
then cops get more nervous, shoot more Black people, who then protest, who
then bring out the Trumpers, who then create more chaos and violence.

But as with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a way to stop them.

Just like when a musician hears that awful screech of feedback on stage, we
must pull the microphone away from the speaker, or the speaker away from
the microphone. It=E2=80=99s that simple. Break the cycle. That doesn=E2=80=
=99t mean
ignoring the news or our president=E2=80=99s online antics (though we could=
 all
ease up on the doom scrolling right now) but maybe engaging with them in a
different way. Not poised to reflexively tweet and retweet, but to slow
down, pull back and understand.

ural victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, the artsy cheekin=
ess of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from the streets of Haight Ashb=
ury to the ivory towers of academia. There, it became the dead serious disc=
ipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis of the way lang=
uage and culture are controlled by those in power. In deconstructing the wa=
y the perceptions, labels, and language of a powerful group can be used to =
limit what seems possible for a less powerful one, they concluded that word=
s can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s i=
dentity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99s high sensitivity to label=
s, language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an adversary willi=
ng to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achil=
les=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br></div><div>Trump certainly sees it that wa=
y, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to deliver a daily dose of language a=
nd imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN, MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in=
 a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad enough, but he=E2=80=99s also =
playing the spoilsport at the very same time, winking and nudging at the pr=
eposterousness of the game itself, as if to say, You saw a military dress o=
n Melania at the RNC? What do you project tonight onto her chromakey gown? =
It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously realizes any of this at al=
l. Whether the result of strategy or intuition, it works.=C2=A0</div><div><=
br></div><div>Critical theory and the linguistic sensitivity it engendered =
doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very well as we attempt to fight back=
 against the post-modern antics of Trump and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99=
s the alt-right using pranksterism to promote fascism, and the formerly che=
eky Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it once created to destabilize=
 the Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are great tools for revolution, b=
ut terrible ones for building consensus or sustainable civics. They can dis=
tract us from the real conditions on the ground, and the facts on which our=
 best arguments rest.</div><div><br></div><div>I don=E2=80=99t even think t=
his was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. There=E2=80=99s more at play her=
e than an academic theory run aground on the shoals of the real world. It=
=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only really worked in the prior media e=
ra, when all we could really do is shout back at the TV screen. Interpretat=
ion and deconstruction are great for broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re=
 not in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=99re participants in a dig=
ital media environment. We=E2=80=99re not just hearing and watching things;=
 our responses become part of the story.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As =
computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99ve gone from command=
 and control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power is more like a feedb=
ack loop, where everything is both the cause and effect of everything else.=
 It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the public is responding to the P=
resident, or if the President is responding to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99=
s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response to white abuse, yet white fear is=
 also a triggered response to Black protests, leading to more abuse, and th=
en more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s=
 as if no one and everyone is responsible. The feedback loop spins out into=
 a cycle of plausible deniability. The crazy 17-year-old is on the streets =
with a rifle, and people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he&#39;s a victim, a t=
errorist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>These feedback loops are what s=
pun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the current culture war, only now, fu=
lly divorced from conditions on the ground or class consciousness. It=E2=80=
=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twitter and cable TV, in symbolism,=
 framing, and word choice. But there&#39;s an actual way things are, which =
gets thrown out in the process. These culture wars concede reality itself. =
No one has any ground for discussion or engagement. And this is largely soc=
ial media&#39;s fault, in that we accept our algorithmically derived profil=
es as some measure of who we are.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But when w=
e pull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going on here, we see a whole bunch =
of poor, disempowered people of every color being programmed by social medi=
a to fight against one another instead of against their mutual oppressors. =
And sure, they can each see how the other side is being manipulated=E2=80=
=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, are being radicalized the sa=
me way.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As this all spins out of control, we=
 find ourselves on the brink of what a full third of Americans believe may =
even become a civil war. People actually shooting each other in the streets=
 based on crazy ass fake bullshit=E2=80=94and giving more ammunition to a P=
resident and media that both thrive off this artificial and unnecessary con=
flict. Chaos and violence work in their favor=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what t=
he administration says out loud=E2=80=94because then cops get more nervous,=
 shoot more Black people, who then protest, who then bring out the Trumpers=
, who then create more chaos and violence.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>B=
ut as with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a way to stop them.=C2=A0</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>Just like when a musician hears that awful screech o=
f feedback on stage, we must pull the microphone away from the speaker, or =
the speaker away from the microphone. It=E2=80=99s that simple. Break the c=
ycle. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean ignoring the news or our president=E2=80=99=
s online antics (though we could all ease up on the doom scrolling right no=
w) but maybe engaging with them in a different way. Not poised to reflexive=
ly tweet and retweet, but to slow down, pull back and understand.=C2=A0</di=
