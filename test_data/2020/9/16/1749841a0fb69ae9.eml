Agreed! Still have your dried starter which I=E2=80=99m hoarding jealously.=
..

Next I=E2=80=99m going to try using the convection oven. I=E2=80=99m gettin=
g plenty of
spring and the loaves are soft enough that adding water at the beginning
(as I did with these) made it almost doughy, so I=E2=80=99m going to see wh=
at
straight convection does to lower cook time/temp and overall spring/crust.
Interesting stuff now that the mechanics are easier!!

Love,
Josh
