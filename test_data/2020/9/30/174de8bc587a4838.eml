related-residential-evictions-will-be-extended-until

Still digging through the details, but at the moment I'd say this puts us
in a much better place. I don't see how they can file for an eviction until
the new year at the earliest, even with our lease expiring, and I don't
know what other course of action is available to them.

To put it another way, in the near term (i.e., October) I think the
majority of the risk is economic (i.e., the landlords assessing fees) but
gives us that long to see if they cash our check (thus going month to
month) or to negotiate something else.

I'll call later today and see if they have cashed the check, and then again
at the end of the week if not. Either way would be solid confirmation that
we're now month-to-month with an arguable case against them assessing
additional fees.

Good news!! Here's to manifesting reality, my friend! :)

All best and more soon,
Josh
