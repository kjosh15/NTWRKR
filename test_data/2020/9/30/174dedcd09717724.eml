I hear you about fragmented time; thanks for catching me up regardless! I
hope you and the family are all doing well despite all the craziness.

The Facebook analogy is a good one; in January I was working with a team
building a ethical version of cambridge analytica for the left and it was
horrifying to see what "ethical" meant in a relative context. Needless to
say your courthouse is a pretty good embodiment of the principle.

Iceland has indeed been spared pretty much everything, but mostly due to
good governance, comprehensive testing, and widespread compliance on the
part of the populace. The kids have adapted well due to our investment in
the language - for them it's just extended summer vacation, except they're
now provided with a 37-student school (with 45 faculty) in a little forest
school where they have woodshop and swimming class. Then they come home and
do as much virtual schooling to NYC as they feel like, which is a
surprising amount (so far.) All in all it's ideal for the under-8 set.

It's been very, very strange for us parents, however. We're essentially
"not coming back" from our summer vacation. Based on what I've been hearing
from my contacts in government and private industry it seemed prudent to
leave our apartment and wait and see what happens after the election. This
means we've been juggling having our cats shipped to my sister, friends
coming in and cannibalizing our apartment, shipping necessities over here,
etc. etc. And don't get me started on US taxes for citizens abroad, which
may/may not result in my giving up citizenship if my startup (
indigometrics.com) ends up selling....!

But those are, all together, pretty paltry concerns. The real issues are
the largely indescribable ones of shock from surviving spring 2020 in NYC
(we came here late June) and guilt in being in a safe, beautiful place
while family and friends are, well, watching courthouses get beaten. These
are, indeed, interesting times.

FWIW I've been running a weekly online D&D session for some kids from our
Covid-pod back in NYC, which has been a way to give back to the parents who
are highly appreciative of the time. At some point, in a far off distant
future, I can totally see us adults resuming such ventures in that
fantastical commodity of "free time." My 7 year old is already showing
signs of wanting me to have more of it, or at least less of me, so I know
it's in the offing.

Glad you're well, and thanks for the help - if the mood strikes I'm very
curious to hear more about what you're seeing over there! And of course if
I can do anything to help please let me know.

All best wishes,
Josh
