Eleanor packed up some stuff from Othinn's cubby last spring and offered to
have Joni take it back with her. Weena, if you're game you could drop it
off at ours and Gustavo could send it on to us with some other things he's
packing. Let me know!

As ever, hugely, HUGELY indebted to you folks...!

All best,
Josh
