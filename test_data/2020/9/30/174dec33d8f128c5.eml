How's this for an overview?

"IndigoMetrics is an expert system SaaS platform that uses short
peer-to-peer surveys on core organizational values to a) measure alignment
and engagement to same, and b) change human behavior autonomously and at
scale. As one of the first HR utilities to provide a statistical model for
belief and behavior we've been able to collect an impressive data set of
bias-corrected behavior changes over time.

We're looking to conduct an academic study of our data to determine how,
where, and at what rate this change can be best effected. As computer
models and data collection expand, the potential for bad modeling and
unexpected effects is growing exponentially. We believe that the
IndigoMetrics platform provides an ideal proving ground for identifying and
preventing mistaken impacts, and improving positive outcomes."

We'd also want to provide the case study doc you made along with an
overview of the types of statistical data we have - can you put that part
together? Separately, can you send your bona fides and I'll bundle
everything together in a single formatted package? I'll ask Harry for a
document template...

Once we get feedback from Michael we can push with other academics or
double-down on Harvard.

All best,
Josh
