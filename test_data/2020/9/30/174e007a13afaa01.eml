Dear Josh

Sorry about the late reply, I just had an operation so I have been away 
on sick leave for some time.

Regarding the cost of setting up á LLC you pay around 160.000 to the 
authorities and I would estimate my cost around 72.500 for the work of 
opening and applying for VAT number (and registration of you as an 
employee if you want). So compared to the USA it is quite expensive:) - 
as most things are in Iceland:)

Best regards,

Guðný G.

    <p>Dear Josh</p>
    <p>Sorry about the late reply, I just had an operation so I have
      been away on sick leave for some time. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Regarding the cost of setting up á LLC you pay around 160.000 to
      the authorities and I would estimate my cost around 72.500 for the
      work of opening and applying for VAT number (and registration of
      you as an employee if you want). So compared to the USA it is
      quite expensive:) - as most things are in Iceland:)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Guðný G.<br>

              <p>As I understand it the legislation covers:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>a) Temporary workers (less than 5 years) when an
                employer sends<br>
                <br>
                an employee to Iceland, he/she is covered under US laws</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>b) If you live in Iceland but employed in Iceland for
                over 5<br>
                <br>
                years, but temporarily work for US companies, you are
                covered<br>
                <br>
                under Icelandic laws</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>If self employed you fall under the laws of the country
                where you<br>
                <br>
                live</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>In Iceland you can work under your own personal
                kennitala (still<br>
                <br>
                being self employed) or under a company kennitala (which
                is often<br>
                <br>
                better, because you can deduct expenses). It depends how
                high your<br>
                <br>
                annual turnover is. Do you you have an Icelandic
                kennitala?</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>I think it would be best to talk directly to the
                Icelandic<br>
                <br>
                authorities. I can do so for you and figure out how best
                to set<br>
                <br>
                this up, but I would of course need to charge for my
                time:)</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>I am going abroad for about 10-14 days tomorrow but I
                could<br>
                <br>
                follow up when coming back, if you like. Otherwise, it
                would<br>
                <br>
                probably be best to talk to a lawyer, I know a few good
                ones:)<br>
