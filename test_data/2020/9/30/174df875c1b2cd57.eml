Hey Josh,

The first round that was paid out around April this year was based on your
2018 tax return or 2019 if it was filed by then.  Your return was filed in
May, therefore after that cut off and you were not eligible in 2018 which
is why you don't receive the funds.  You are eligible based on your 2019
tax return and most likely 2020 tax return.

Based on my understanding, the stimulus check is a credit for the 2020 tax
year so if you are eligible in 2020 for the credit and didn't receive it,
you will when filing 2020 taxes.

So there is nothing to be done now.

Stephanie
