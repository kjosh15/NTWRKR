Hey man

I suck at emails. Sorry.

Lets connect soon. Life is ok, more stable since the last we spoke. Have
been in Vermont most of the summer. Traveled a little back and forth to AZ
to see Megan. Glad to hear you made it to Iceland. How are things there?

We are starting to think about going into the market to sell. We need to
hit a couple more milestones in the next 2 quarters, but we really need to
JV or merge with a strategic to see the tech adoption get to the next
level.

Lets find a time for a Zoom call when you are free
