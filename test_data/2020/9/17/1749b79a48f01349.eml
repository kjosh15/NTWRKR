Here's some other contacts that might be useful:

- The lawyer who set up Stephen Colbert's PAC
- David Goldstein, the friend who built a cambridge analytica for the left
- Mark Hammond, AI at Microsoft
- Ben Laurie, AI at google
- Marina Gorbis, head of Institute for the Future

That is just a start; let me know where/what of the above looks useful and
I can expand!

encircle the Pentagon in order to levitate it and exorcise it from evil. As=
 Allen Ginsberg explained, =E2=80=9CThe Pentagon was symbolically levitated=

=E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the collective countercultural=
 effort to destabilize myth surrounding the American Dream. What made these=
 performative, po-mo protests work so well was that they were cheeky. While=
 their ultimate intentions were of existential importance=E2=80=94ending th=
e Vietnam War, race murder, and economic oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=

werful. How do you fight a clown?=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=
=E2=80=99s the orange man playing the part of the clown, with QAnon as his =
Yippie minions, pranking the public with fake news and metaphorical stunts =
that work whether or not they=E2=80=99re taken seriously. In fact, the less=
 serious they seem, the more wiggle room they create=E2=80=94for confusion =
in the audience, and denial by the prankster.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><di=
v>The Republican National Convention may have been the most blatant celebra=
tion of authoritarianism in American history, but it was also postmodern th=
eater. An appearance by a couple whose sole qualification for speaking was =
having waved guns at BLM protestors marching by their home; Melania Trump d=
ressed in a military-themed outfit almost identical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Me=
lania following up the next night in a chroma-key green dress, as if to say=
 =E2=80=9Cproject onto me whatever you want=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself res=
ponding to accusations that it was illegal to use the Rose Garden for a cam=
paign by acknowledging his White House backdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=
=80=99re here, they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div=
>The progressive Twitterverse responded to each taunt with greater outrage,=
 posting side-by-side comparisons of Melania=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=
=E2=80=99s, scoffing at Trump=E2=80=99s use of the White House as a set pie=
ce, and dutifully superimposing anti-Trump imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chr=
oma key dress. Triggered, provoked, and destabilized, the Left loses touch =
with whatever issues it may hold dear, drawn instead into a frenzy of specu=
lation about Trump=E2=80=99s rhetorical pyrotechnics. =C2=A0</div><div><br>=
</div><div>Did the Trumps really mean to accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe =
not. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter, as long as we obsess over trying to figure =
it out. This is the desired effect=E2=80=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaga=
nda pranksterism. As Walter Lippmann, the founder of the field of public re=
lations, explained back in the 1920s: the object of the game is to create a=
 =E2=80=9Cpseudo environment=E2=80=9D between people and reality by simply =
=E2=80=9Cputting pictures into their heads.=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imagi=
nations take care of the rest.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Trump has bee=
n able to seize the power of all this semiotic play because the left has re=
linquished it. In part, it=E2=80=99s because the Left is now in the positio=
n of the top-down broadcasters, and Trump has assumed the mantle of the cou=
ntercultural rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars=
. Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94at least the principle=E2=80=94that w=
omen, people of color, LGBTQ, and every intersectional group deserves equal=
 rights. But this put the Left on defense, always on alert for language and=
 imagery that violated its hard-won cultural victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br=
></div><div>Meanwhile, the artsy cheekiness of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krass=
ner went from the streets of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia=
. There, it became the dead serious discipline known as critical theory=E2=
=80=94an earnest analysis of the way language and culture are controlled by=
 those in power. In deconstructing the way the perceptions, labels, and lan=
guage of a powerful group can be used to limit what seems possible for a le=
ss powerful one, they concluded that words can be a form of violence. It=E2=
=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s identity politics, wokeism, and the=
 Left=E2=80=99s high sensitivity to labels, language, and other triggers. A=
nd=E2=80=94when facing an adversary willing to say anything=E2=80=94it may =
also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achilles=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br><=
/div><div>Trump certainly sees it that way, which is why he=E2=80=99s so ha=
ppy to deliver a daily dose of language and imagery guaranteed to get every=
one on CNN, MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That wo=
uld be bad enough, but he=E2=80=99s also playing the spoilsport at the very=
 same time, winking and nudging at the preposterousness of the game itself,=
 as if to say, You saw a military dress on Melania at the RNC? What do you =
project tonight onto her chromakey gown? It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if =
he consciously realizes any of this at all. Whether the result of strategy =
or intuition, it works.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Critical theory and =
the linguistic sensitivity it engendered doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving=
 us very well as we attempt to fight back against the post-modern antics of=
 Trump and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99s the alt-right using pranksterism=
 to promote fascism, and the formerly cheeky Left now stranded in the hall =
of mirrors it once created to destabilize the Old Guard. Word play and mind=
fuckery are great tools for revolution, but terrible ones for building cons=
ensus or sustainable civics. They can distract us from the real conditions =
on the ground, and the facts on which our best arguments rest.</div><div><b=
r></div><div>I don=E2=80=99t even think this was entirely the Left=E2=80=99=
s fault. There=E2=80=99s more at play here than an academic theory run agro=
und on the shoals of the real world. It=E2=80=99s that the approach itself =
only really worked in the prior media era, when all we could really do is s=
hout back at the TV screen. Interpretation and deconstruction are great for=
 broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re not in a spectator democracy, anymo=
re. We=E2=80=99re participants in a digital media environment. We=E2=80=99r=
e not just hearing and watching things; our responses become part of the st=
ory.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As computer scientist Norbert Wiener fo=
retold, we=E2=80=99ve gone from command and control to cybernetics. Our rel=
ationship to power is more like a feedback loop, where everything is both t=
he cause and effect of everything else. It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse wh=
ether the public is responding to the President, or if the President is res=
ponding to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a res=
ponse to white abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black =
protests, leading to more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s no=
 longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is respon=
sible. The feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible deniability. T=
he crazy 17-year-old is on the streets with a rifle, and people can=E2=80=
=99t agree whether he&#39;s a victim, a terrorist, or both.</div><div><br><=
/div><div>These feedback loops are what spun out the Tea Party and Occupy i=
nto the current culture war, only now, fully divorced from conditions on th=
e ground or class consciousness. It=E2=80=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=
=9D on Twitter and cable TV, in symbolism, framing, and word choice. But th=
ere&#39;s an actual way things are, which gets thrown out in the process. T=
hese culture wars concede reality itself. No one has any ground for discuss=
ion or engagement. And this is largely social media&#39;s fault, in that we=
 accept our algorithmically derived profiles as some measure of who we are.=
=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But when we pull back and look at what=E2=
=80=99s going on here, we see a whole bunch of poor, disempowered people of=
 every color being programmed by social media to fight against one another =
instead of against their mutual oppressors. And sure, they can each see how=
 the other side is being manipulated=E2=80=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they=
, themselves, are being radicalized the same way.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div=
><div>As this all spins out of control, we find ourselves on the brink of w=
hat a full third of Americans believe may even become a civil war. People a=
ctually shooting each other in the streets based on crazy ass fake bullshit=
=E2=80=94and giving more ammunition to a President and media that both thri=
ve off this artificial and unnecessary conflict. Chaos and violence work in=
 their favor=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what the administration says out loud=
=E2=80=94because then cops get more nervous, shoot more Black people, who t=
hen protest, who then bring out the Trumpers, who then create more chaos an=
d violence.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But as with all feedback loops, =
there=E2=80=99s a way to stop them.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Just lik=
e when a musician hears that awful screech of feedback on stage, we must pu=
ll the microphone away from the speaker, or the speaker away from the micro=
phone. It=E2=80=99s that simple. Break the cycle. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean=
 ignoring the news or our president=E2=80=99s online antics (though we coul=
d all ease up on the doom scrolling right now) but maybe engaging with them=
 in a different way. Not poised to reflexively tweet and retweet, but to sl=
ow down, pull back and understand.=C2=A0</div></div><div><br></div><div><br=
