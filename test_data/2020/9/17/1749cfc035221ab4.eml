=E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94=
at least the principle=E2=80=94that women, people of color, LGBTQ, and =

went from the streets of Haight Ashbury to the ivory towers of academia. =
There, it became the dead serious discipline known as critical =
theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis of the way language and culture are =
controlled by those in power. In deconstructing the way the perceptions, =
labels, and language of a powerful group can be used to limit what seems =
possible for a less powerful one, they concluded that words can be a =
form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s identity =

at the very same time, winking and nudging at the preposterousness of =
the game itself, as if to say, You saw a military dress on Melania at =
the RNC? What do you project tonight onto her chromakey gown? It =

it=E2=80=99s the alt-right using pranksterism to promote fascism, and =
the formerly cheeky Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it once =
created to destabilize the Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are =

is responding to the President, or if the President is responding to a =
Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.  BLM protests are a response to white =
abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black protests, =
leading to more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer =
a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is =
responsible. The feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible =

class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">1. The Social Dilemma, a new Netflix =
documentary came out, making many of the arguments that people like me, =
Sherry Turkle, Cliff Nass, Howard Rheingold, Andrew Keen, Evgeny =
Morozov, Astra Taylor, Richard Barbrook, Nick Carr, Mark Bauerlain, and =
even Raffi have been making about the impact of social media =
manipulation on our psyche and society for many years. Only in the =
movie, it's the tech guys who actually made these platforms who are =
blowing the whistle on their own previous misdeeds.&nbsp;</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">I'm getting lots of very =
supportive email from people who recognize our words and metaphors =
coming out of the mouths of the contrite tech developers - but I think =
it's important we don't get possessive about our work. This is not about =
getting credit, but saving our very society.&nbsp;</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Our bigger goal should =
be to try to get some of these new tech reformers to divest from their =
holdings in Facebook, Google, and the other companies aiming at our =
brainstems. If, like they're saying, these companies are as big an =
existential threat to humanity as climate change, then it doesn't make =
sense to have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars invested in them. =
It's like holding stock in cigarette or oil companies. We can't profit =
off the harm.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">I've got a monologue about this that opens <a =
href=3D"https://teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-165-helen-pluckrose-and-james-lin=
dsay-toward-justice-for-all/" target=3D"_blank" class=3D"">the new Team =
Human show</a>, with a couple of highly controversial guests, the =
authors of <i class=3D"">Cynical Theories</i>, Helen Pluckrose and James =
Lindsay.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">2. I have a new big piece in GEN on Medium. You can read it =
<a =
href=3D"https://gen.medium.com/the-gop-stole-satire-from-the-left-6f373b8e=
5bad" target=3D"_blank" class=3D"">online here</a>, or I have pasted it =
below.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">I'll write again in the next week or so with some upcoming =
stuff and thoughts about where we are right now as a society. I don't =
think this whole thing has to fall apart, but it could. Accepting that =
possibility doesn't have to trigger fear; it can also inspire new =
resolve.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D""><b class=3D"">THIS IS =
NOT A DRESS</b></div><div class=3D""><b class=3D"">How the Right Stole =
Operation Mindfuck from the Left</b></div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D""><div class=3D"">I still remember when =
it was the Left who had more fun. It wasn=E2=80=99t just that they were =
younger and had better hair, music, and drugs (though all of that =
certainly helped); it was that the Left was fabulously irreverent. =
Whether nominating a pig for president, or raining dollar bills on the =
New York Stock Exchange, these were pranksters and media activists who =
tweaked their noses at authority and undermined the foundations of =
consensus society.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump and QAnon who have taken on that =
countercultural mantle, using the media available at their disposal to =
destabilize fact-based reality and promote conspiracy theories=E2=80=94and=
 to do it all so cheekily that we can=E2=80=99t even tell if they =
actually believe what they=E2=80=99re saying.&nbsp;</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Trump=E2=80=99s =
gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s counterculture at its most =
effective, when satirists and pranksters began applying some of the =
principles of postmodern art to protest. At its core, postmodernism was =
about rejecting big, overarching ideologies. If we could deconstruct =
these top-down narratives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the =
formerly passive spectators=E2=80=94could have as much power over the =
perception of reality as the authorities broadcasting it. The trick was =
simply to sow doubt by enacting stunts that make people question their =
own belief systems, revealing accepted truths as arbitrary =
illusions.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Although Europeans have understood the power of postmodernism =
since the Dadaists, in America it was probably counterculture writer =
Paul Krassner who first weaponized the idea, publishing the first =
intentionally =E2=80=9Cfake news=E2=80=9D story in his satirical =
magazine The Realist. Meant as an antidote to the anodyne treatment of =
John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s assassination by mainstream books and =
articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece claimed that while the president=E2=80=99=
s body was being transported on Air Force One, Jackie Kennedy walked in =
Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the exit wound in her husband=E2=80=99=
s skull. Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known crudity and lust for power, the =
myth gained traction as both news and metaphor.&nbsp;</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Likewise, we saw Abbie =
Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the Yippies declaring in 1967 that they were =
=E2=80=9Cnow in the business of wholesale disruption and widespread =
resistance and dislocation of the American society,=E2=80=9D and embark =
on a project to encircle the Pentagon in order to levitate it and =
exorcise it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg explained, =E2=80=9CThe =
Pentagon was symbolically levitated in people=E2=80=99s minds in the =
sense that=E2=80=A6the authority of the Pentagon psychologically was =
dissolved.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Robert Anton Wilson eventually claimed all of this activity =
as part of =E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the collective =
countercultural effort to destabilize myth surrounding the American =
Dream. What made these performative, po-mo protests work so well was =
that they were cheeky. While their ultimate intentions were of =
existential importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War, race murder, and =
economic oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take themselves =
seriously at all. This is part of what made them so powerful. How do you =
fight a clown?&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Today, it=E2=80=99s the orange man playing the part of the =
clown, with QAnon as his Yippie minions, pranking the public with fake =
news and metaphorical stunts that work whether or not they=E2=80=99re =
taken seriously. In fact, the less serious they seem, the more wiggle =
room they create=E2=80=94for confusion in the audience, and denial by =
the prankster.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">The Republican National Convention may have been the most =
blatant celebration of authoritarianism in American history, but it was =
also postmodern theater. An appearance by a couple whose sole =
qualification for speaking was having waved guns at BLM protestors =
marching by their home; Melania Trump dressed in a military-themed =
outfit almost identical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania following up the =
next night in a chroma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9Cproject =
onto me whatever you want=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself responding to =
accusations that it was illegal to use the Rose Garden for a campaign by =
acknowledging his White House backdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re =
here, they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">The progressive Twitterverse responded =
to each taunt with greater outrage, posting side-by-side comparisons of =
Melania=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=E2=80=99s, scoffing at Trump=E2=80=99=
s use of the White House as a set piece, and dutifully superimposing =
anti-Trump imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dress. Triggered, =
provoked, and destabilized, the Left loses touch with whatever issues it =
may hold dear, drawn instead into a frenzy of speculation about =
Trump=E2=80=99s rhetorical pyrotechnics. &nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Did the Trumps really mean to =
accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter, as =
long as we obsess over trying to figure it out. This is the desired =
effect=E2=80=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda pranksterism. As =
Walter Lippmann, the founder of the field of public relations, explained =
back in the 1920s: the object of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpseudo =
environment=E2=80=9D between people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputting=
 pictures into their heads.=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imaginations take =
care of the rest.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">Trump has been able to seize the power of all this semiotic =
play because the left has relinquished it. In part, it=E2=80=99s because =
the Left is now in the position of the top-down broadcasters, and Trump =
has assumed the mantle of the countercultural rebel. Indeed, the Left =
=E2=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94=
at least the principle=E2=80=94that women, people of color, LGBTQ, and =
every intersectional group deserves equal rights. But this put the Left =
on defense, always on alert for language and imagery that violated its =
hard-won cultural victories.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Meanwhile, the artsy cheekiness of =
Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from the streets of Haight Ashbury =
to the ivory towers of academia. There, it became the dead serious =
discipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis of the =
way language and culture are controlled by those in power. In =
deconstructing the way the perceptions, labels, and language of a =
powerful group can be used to limit what seems possible for a less =
powerful one, they concluded that words can be a form of violence. =
It=E2=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s identity politics, wokeism, =
and the Left=E2=80=99s high sensitivity to labels, language, and other =
triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an adversary willing to say =
anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achilles=E2=80=
=99 heel.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Trump =
certainly sees it that way, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to =
deliver a daily dose of language and imagery guaranteed to get everyone =
on CNN, MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in a tizzy. He said what???? That =
would be bad enough, but he=E2=80=99s also playing the spoilsport at the =
very same time, winking and nudging at the preposterousness of the game =
itself, as if to say, You saw a military dress on Melania at the RNC? =
What do you project tonight onto her chromakey gown? It doesn=E2=80=99t =
even matter if he consciously realizes any of this at all. Whether the =
result of strategy or intuition, it works.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">Critical theory and the linguistic =
sensitivity it engendered doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very =
well as we attempt to fight back against the post-modern antics of Trump =
and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99s the alt-right using pranksterism to =
promote fascism, and the formerly cheeky Left now stranded in the hall =
of mirrors it once created to destabilize the Old Guard. Word play and =
mindfuckery are great tools for revolution, but terrible ones for =
building consensus or sustainable civics. They can distract us from the =
real conditions on the ground, and the facts on which our best arguments =
rest.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">I =
don=E2=80=99t even think this was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. =
There=E2=80=99s more at play here than an academic theory run aground on =
the shoals of the real world. It=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only =
really worked in the prior media era, when all we could really do is =
shout back at the TV screen. Interpretation and deconstruction are great =
for broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re not in a spectator democracy, =
anymore. We=E2=80=99re participants in a digital media environment. =
We=E2=80=99re not just hearing and watching things; our responses become =
part of the story.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">As computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99ve =
gone from command and control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power =
is more like a feedback loop, where everything is both the cause and =
effect of everything else. It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the =
public is responding to the President, or if the President is responding =
to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99s both.&nbsp; BLM protests are a response =
to white abuse, yet white fear is also a triggered response to Black =
protests, leading to more abuse, and then more protests. There=E2=80=99s =
no longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s as if no one and everyone is =
responsible. The feedback loop spins out into a cycle of plausible =
deniability. The crazy 17-year-old is on the streets with a rifle, and =
people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he's a victim, a terrorist, or =
both.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">These =
feedback loops are what spun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the =
current culture war, only now, fully divorced from conditions on the =
ground or class consciousness. It=E2=80=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D=
 on Twitter and cable TV, in symbolism, framing, and word choice. But =
there's an actual way things are, which gets thrown out in the process. =
