Konrad,

I need to make some additions to josh.is' DNS zone file. Also note that
AXFR is enabled, which some say is a security risk. Is there a way I can
edit the DNS zone file directly? If not, can you add these records?

when highly virtualized. As ever, let me know if doing my DNS hosting is
too much of a PITA (especially now that you're a parent!) Otherwise, as
ever, I am a million times grateful. Let me know if you'd like to catch up
sometime <https://josh.is/scheduling>; I'm curious how life in the western
USA is now - we've moved to Iceland so it's an increasingly rarified view.

Many many thanks,
Josh
