Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) MediaTemple.

The reason some browsers are still displaying the warning that the site is not secure is because the domain name that was added to the Multi-domain certificate is indigometrics.com not www.indigometrics.com. This is causing a certificate name mismatch. Simply update the .htaccess file to redirect to indigometrics.com instead of www.indigometrics.com.

Please let us know if there's anything else we can answer for you regarding the information in this support request or any of your (mt) Media Temple services. We are here 24/7 to assist you. Thank you for choosing (mt) Media Temple for your hosting needs.

Best regards,
