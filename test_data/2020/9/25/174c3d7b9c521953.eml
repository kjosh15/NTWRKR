I got a reply back from Jay today and I read over his forum post to further
familiarize myself with his issue. I suspect he's having a power supply
issue. Either an under-rated power supply or one that's properly rated yet
faulty. Or, he's got the Arduino plugged into his computer still (over USB)
and the board can only pull 500mA this way. In short- I think he's browing
out (heh) for one reason or another. I sent him some things to try and when
he gets back to me we'll be a lot further along.

Derp. I'll start copying you on the rest of the troubleshooting discussion,
starting with whatever answers I get back from him tomorrow. No need for me
to summarize separately, and you should see the troubleshooting process
anyway.

If it's not the power supply I will suspect wiring. His perch switches
might be ground-looping and resetting the Arduino. One way or another, his
Arduino is being reset while it's running.

           Sorry, meant to follow up; I had a behaviour similar to what you=
 described when I had screwed the disk down too tightly and it was affectin=

           Have you tried detaching the two switches?=C2=A0 The pins that c=
ontrol the coin detector are odd, they are the interrupt detector pins and,=
 betraying my hazy knowledge and magical thinking when it comes to electron=
ics, in my box I had some problem with activity in one of the lid switches =
&quot;bleeding over&quot; into the interrupt detector, so I remapped those =
to non-adjacent pins in the code and it worked after that, I mean for while=
, a seagull has since destroyed my coin channel, but that&#39;s another pro=

           So, you have probably tried this but I would suggest unplugging =
both switches and seeing if mode 3 works.

            To clarify, yes, it still does the same thing. Does that point =

                  Hi folks!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <div>
                   I got my crowbox built and got to the stage of function =
testing (electronics stage 5) and things seemed to be working properly... b=
ut then not quite. During the stage 2 testing, the sliding lid behaved as e=
xpected when one of the switches was pushed, but when the other was pushed =
it would not wait before closing but would instead wait just a second or tw=
o before closing halfway, opening again, and then waiting another second or=
 two before doing the normal incremental close. The next time around, it di=
d the same thing, with only the other switch (seemed to be the second one p=
ushed either way?)
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   <br>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   Stage 3 and stage 4 saw this weird behavior again of sta=
rting to close up again right away after a coin was passed through, then op=
ening again, then normal incremental close. And in the 20 minutes I&#39;ve =
sat here mulling, it&#39;s just now decided to open and close on its own wh=
ile sitting at stage 3.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   <br>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   So I had been suspecting something wrong with the switch=
es, but the fact that it&#39;s doing the same thing in stage 3/4 when the s=
witches have no effect seems like it points to something else. Servo? Ardui=
no? Something not quite right with the wiring? This is my first project of =
this sort so I&#39;m not sure how to troubleshoot. Though I do note that my=
 servo seems to take quite a while of whirring to itself when it&#39;s boot=
ing and getting parked after I power on or hit the reset, about twice as lo=
ng as it seems to take in the videos.
