Hi Jay- happy to help. I wish I could have gotten to you sooner, but let's
see if we can get you fixed up.

First- I'm really glad you were able to swap the servo and the Arduino.
This is really helpful, as bad (DOA) servos have affected a couple of
builds that I'm aware of. Usually Arduino Genuino boards are of very high
quality and reliability but we've seen problems with some of the clones.
Not only do you have a Genuino, you were able to swap the board, so we can
stop worrying about that.

Second- Did you make any changes at all to the CrOS source code?

Right now I suspect there's a power supply issue so we should check a
couple of things to see if we can rule that in, or rule it out and look for
another cause. I know of two builds which had power supply issues and both
of those builds exhibited odd servo behavior that couldn't be easily
explained- things the CrOS software shouldn't really be able to direct the
servo to do. At least, not in the order you described.

First, a fact about servo operation: When the servo first starts to move,
it can pull a decent amount of current. If the system is underpowered, or
there's a problem with the power supply itself, this current surge can
'brown out' the Arduino board and sometimes cause it to reboot. As you
know, when the Crowbox reboots the first thing it will do is pull the lid
all the way open then step-close it. This could explain why your lid
behaves the way it does.

Here are three problems I'd like you to help me rule in or out:

1) If you are running your electronics tests with the Arduino still
connected to your computer via USB, you still need to plug in the 5V/2A
power supply. The Arduino can only pull about 500mA of current from the USB
connection and this is not enough to run the board and run the servo, so
brownouts can happen this way.

2) Make sure the power supply you are using is a 5V/2Amp power supply. The
Arduino only requires about 50mA to run, but the servo can pull spikes up
around 700 or 800 mA, which can brown out a power supply that's rated under
1 Amp. If there's any additional friction, the servo can pull over 1000mA
which is why we recommend a 2 Amp (2000mA) power supply to make sure
there's plenty of available current.

3) If you are already using a power supply, and the power supply is rated
for 2 Amps, maybe try swapping power supplies with your friend, as well. Of
the two power supply-related problems I know of, one person was using a
very weak 500mA power supply, and the other person had a brand new 2 Amp
power supply that was faulty and didn't supply steady current.

If you're not sure about the power supply rating, you can take a picture of
the wall-socket plug- The side with all of the specifications printed on
it, and send that to me to look at.

-Steve

 the country late last year and then again this year, so I&#39;ve been sort=
 of unplugged from the project for a while. Josh has been asking me to help=
 troubleshoot your problem and I&#39;m now finally in a position to spend s=

 know you&#39;ve already done this- Josh sends me a lot of support requests=
 and I deal with as many as I can. But this means I don&#39;t know exactly =
what your situation is. So if you could explain your problem and/or point m=
e to some existing posts in the Crowbox group so that I can catch up and de=
vise a troubleshooting strategy, that would be very helpful. If I recall co=
rrectly, you have a problem we haven&#39;t seen before so our off-the-shelf=
 solutions won&#39;t help you.</p></div><div><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u></u>=
