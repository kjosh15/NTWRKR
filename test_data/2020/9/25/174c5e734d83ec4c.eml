Do we want them shipped here?

Gustavo and I had a good talk - he can get everything packed and stored by
Dec, but otherwise would need help with anything else. Talked about two
scenarios:

- month to month: he packs and stores stuff until everything is out by Dec.

- Anything else: he sets aside what he needs to live there and Shea moves
everything to storage by Oct.

Sound good?

Xoxo,
Josh
