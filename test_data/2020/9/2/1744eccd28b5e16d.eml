Given that the landlord is looking at being unable to evict anyone until
2021, I propose I email Reid telling him the repairs are very overdue and
represent an unlivable situation while highlighting that they were
requested by the tenants union, and ask for a call.

Then, on the call, tell him:

1) We know he's unable to evict us until next year,
2) We cannot pay full rent this year but would like to stay,
3) We are aware that we can withhold rent until the repairs are done as
they are necessary repairs,
4) We are aware that if he pushes for eviction we can make the case that it
is retaliatory in light of the tenant's union action.

Finally, we'd rather sign a 6 month lease for $1,125/month. Will he
reconsider?

Thoughts?

xoxo,
Josh
