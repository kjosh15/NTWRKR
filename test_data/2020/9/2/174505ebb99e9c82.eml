Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple.

I checked your server and didn't find any issues that would have caused intermittent downtime. That said, the Grid Service is a shared service, which means that you're sharing resources with other customers. While not too common, it is possible for another customer on your cluster to receive a high amount of traffic, intermittently causing an issue with your website. We have checks in place to mitigate this when it does occur. If this was caused by another customer on the same cluster as your Grid Service, they would be moved to their own container so it wouldn't affect your website for long. I checked your website and found that the website is now live so you should be all set moving forward. 

If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this support request, or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We are here 24/7 to assist you.

Best regards,

Richard A.
