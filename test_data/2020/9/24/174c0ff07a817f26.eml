Matan,

Thank you for contacting (mt) MediaTemple.

While a DV server would be faster in a lot of cases it would take a bit of
customization on your part to make sure that your site is as fast as
possible and runs full time. I say this as with the DV servers the services
such as Apache (which run php) and MySQL would be your responsibility to
keep up to date and optimized for your service. Once configured it would
definitely be our speediest option. As another choice I'd highly suggest
looking into our new cPanel hosting, I personally moved my hosted sites
from our Grid Service to this new service and saw a 1-2 second boost just
from the move. While acedoteal and obviously depends on the site content,
this cPanel shared hosting would seem to be a better more cost effective
fit.

If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us
by replying to this support request or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We
are here 24/7 to assist you.

Best regards,
