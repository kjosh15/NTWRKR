Josh,

Starting a new email thread for this, so we have one for climate change and
one for AI.

Here is my format submission and my large mental dump for the week.

I think something that was uttered in yesterday's phone call has stuck with
me, and that is persuading someone to =E2=80=9Csee the other side=E2=80=9D =
using AI. I
think there really is something there.

Here is where I=E2=80=99ll start things off=E2=80=94admittedly with a real =
shakeup.

*Influence*

The show I had been working on last year employed somewhat similar
thinking, using data to inform structure, format, etc=E2=80=94the monster-l=
ed
history program I mentioned over the phone for the BBC. Please keep all
this between us, as there are IP implications here. But the first network I
brought that program to, BBC Studios and BBC III, showed interest right out
of the gate and greenlit it, after just one meeting. The reason? The show's
success was all based in data.

The program, which fell apart after a huge shakeup at the BBC because of
Boris Johnson, has changed forms. But the latest format is something
attuned to "Mr Rogers for adults with a monster." It's a program meant to
heal and ease adults suffering mental health-related trauma because of
what's happened in the UK and US the past several years.

Though we'd need to discuss this much further, as I've put in a huge amount
of work into this program.

But I could be willing to see how these ideas could be fused together. The
concepts are starting to sound somewhat similar, which is actually a really
good sign, as it could be a sign that we cuold have an easy time getting
this greenlit. Let's discuss that more down the line.

But a late-night program without the scorn and using repetitive,
data-driven elements to ease tension between Americans, that's the thinking=
.

*Format*

Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, the show could focus
exclusively on =E2=80=9Cconvincing those on the other side of the world=E2=
=80=99s biggest
arguments to change their minds.=E2=80=9D And we will do that with AI.

If this was done in a caring and comedic way, it could be brilliant and
achieve much of what we set out to do=E2=80=94ie the concept mentioned abov=
e. So
how about this...

It=E2=80=99s a late-night show where a host lays out a debate in America, o=
ne that
viewers may have an opinion about. =E2=80=9CAnd then using the world=E2=80=
=99s most
advanced artificial and persuasive intelligence, we=E2=80=99re going to att=
empt to
change your mind.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CThis week, our AI (sitting to the right of me) has been having
conversations over SMS with both a climate change skeptic and a climate
change activist. Our AI wanted to bring each of them over to the other
side. So what do you think, did our AI succeed?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve invited two of those our AI had the conversations wi=
th here to the
studio to reread their exchanges for us on air.=E2=80=9D

A reading of each conversation takes place. And before the conversation
concludes, it=E2=80=99s halted and the show=E2=80=99s crew and/or audience =
votes on whether
that person ends up changing their mind.

At the end of the program, an expert is interviewed by the host about the
origins of the debate.

The additional funny parts of the program include the look of the person
reading the AI portions of the conversation, as=E2=80=94like you said=E2=80=
=94it should be
a person who looks like the individual most likely to convince the person
we=E2=80=99re targeting. And most importantly, the juxtaposition of a
surreal-looking character interviewing or speaking to a real person.

The show is called AIO. (The AI is named O.) And some physical
representation of O could be a character on the show.

What's I've described above is a very close version of what the program I
designed last year with the BBC, called Thud, was about. But I sense we can
fuse these two ideas, as much of the groundwork has already been done. We
just need to discuss IP, etc.

Thoughts?
Matt
