Thanks, Julie. We=E2=80=99re at:

33-53 82nd st #b42

And my cell # is 347-268-0376

Would it be possible for you to review the place the week before to see if
it impacts your estimate? We=E2=80=99ve been slowly exiting stuff since las=
t we
spoke so are hopeful it might be a quicker project than you initially
suggested.

Many thanks!!
- J

 pack and move to local storage in Queens at $2000 that would be packing ev=
erything and bringing just the boxes, not the large furniture. Adding the f=
urniture would be another $1000. If you need us to bring the whole load to =
Claudia<br><br> Carby at Transcontainer Transport we could do that for $300=
0. These are sort of average prices assuming that you have a master bedroom=
 that we don=E2=80=99t see and a kitchen and all of the things that people =
live with. You have lots of storage room and shelving.<br><br> It looks lik=
e you have a lot of stuff and some rooms that we are not seeing. That said,=
 these pictures are enough for me to get a good idea.<br><br><br><br><br>&g=
t;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; The price includes all travel time, fuel charges=
 and tolls. We do not charge for parking tickets. Your price includes a one=
 time use mattress bag for your mattress, general disassembly and reassembl=
y of furniture pieces if needed, the use of our equipment<br><br> such as w=
ardrobes or dollies and the wrapping of larger items and furniture. <br><br=
><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; We are assuming that everything fits in a=
nd out of the locations. If any items do not fit we will have to leave them=
 in an agreed upon safe location. We will wrap all of the furniture in blan=
kets and bring reusable wardrobes for your hanging clothing.<br><br><br><br=
><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; All furniture that we take apart on your =
move will be put together on the other side. Please keep in mind that we ca=
nnot insure particle board furniture like Ikea.=C2=A0 The joints have not b=
een glued and the backings are often stapled masonite. It never quite<br><b=
r> returns to its original condition when assembled and disassembled. We ca=
n also not insure nature stone or drift wood type natural objects that may =
have a weakened vein or hidden structural defect that prevents them from ha=
ndling the stress of the move. Thin<br><br> sheets of marble should be crat=
ed in a padded wooden crate. That said, it is sometimes not worth the cost =
of the piece to build a crate for the movement of a marble item. We do try =
our best to move marble pieces in cardboard and blankets, but we can not in=
sure<br><br> marble or stone pieces. <br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&g=
t; This was based on an hourly rate of $250 an hour for 4 men and a truck f=
or 8 hours to pack and bring you to local storage. Another 3 men at $200 an=
 hour for 5 hours to bring the furniture to storage, and again, 5 hours to =
bring it to Carteret, load it and<br><br> return, 15 minutes to get to the =
job and 15 minutes to get away is included in those estimates. If you think=
 that we have over estimated the time, you are welcome to pay for the move =
hourly.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&gt;&gt; This estimate is ba=

you would like to purchase it, we are insurable up to $25,000. The cost wou=
