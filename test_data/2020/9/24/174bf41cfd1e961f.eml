Beautiful! Gives me something to aim for, definitely. At this point we're
waiting for contracts to get signed and income to be inbound, at which
point we'll move into the farmhouse down the street and likely do a trip to
IKEO for some decent cookware. Towards the end of the year we'll likely
ship our NYC apartments' contents over... it's always crazy to ship cast
iron, but I'll be honest I miss my trusty pots and pans!

By stockpile I mean food and emergency supplies. When the pandemic hit NYC
hard it was a great comfort to be able to pull whatever we needed out of
storage when the stores ran out. It's definitely a project, but one I
suspect you'd enjoy - you basically need to keep a rotating stock of
long-term staples, pulling things out every 3-6 months and rotating in new
items. We've found it's helped us a ton in terms of using our resources
better (i.e., no 10-year-old cans of beans in the back of the pantry) as
well as being a huge help in a pinch (such as when a website bug caused a
grocery delivery not to arrive). Rule of thumb is to have 2-8 weeks of food
and supplies stored, but there's tons of literature online about it, most
of which I suspect you'll already have intuited.

The main thing is that you should be prepared to shelter in place or hit
the road. Some starting points:

https://theprepared.com/prepping-basics/guides/emergency-preparedness-check=
list-prepping-beginners/

or

https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/emergency-preparedness/

and here's some ideas for your bugout bag (the "hit the road" bag):

https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gear-for-your-bug-out-bag/

Again, you probably already have most of these items, but thinking about it
in terms of "we need to walk out the door and not come back" is a huge
help. To be honest, after years of traveling it was a weird sort of relief
to realize that arriving in Iceland and not going back didn't impact me
much - pretty much everything I really needed was already in my pack.

Love,
Josh
