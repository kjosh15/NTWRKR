Good to see you on today's W50 zoom! Sounds like interesting times where
you are, for sure.

I'm seeing similar behavior in terms of corporate activity (despite the
celebratory notes in today's zoom session!) - lots of slowdown across the
board.

One topic for potential discussion: you said on today's call that you were
curious how people were managing company culture. I've got one potential
answer; a SaaS platform that manages culture and behavior algorithmically
using an expert system. I've attached a deck in case you're interested - if
so I'd be mighty curious how you think big companies would respond to the
notion!

All best wishes,
Josh
