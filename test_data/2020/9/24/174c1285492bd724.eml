Please keep me looped in on this - I'm really curious about why cPanel and
Plesk would provide significant load time differences.

Thank you for contacting (mt) MediaTemple.<br>
<br>
While a DV server would be faster in a lot of cases it would take a bit of =
customization on your part to make sure that your site is as fast as possib=
le and runs full time. I say this as with the DV servers the services such =
as Apache (which run php) and MySQL would be your responsibility to keep up=
 to date and optimized for your service. Once configured it would definitel=
y be our speediest option. As another choice I&#39;d highly suggest looking=
 into our new cPanel hosting, I personally moved my hosted sites from our G=
rid Service to this new service and saw a 1-2 second boost just from the mo=
ve. While acedoteal and obviously depends on the site content, this cPanel =
shared hosting would seem to be a better more cost effective fit.<br>
<br>
If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us=
 by replying to this support request or by calling us at 310-841-5500. We a=
re here 24/7 to assist you.<br>
