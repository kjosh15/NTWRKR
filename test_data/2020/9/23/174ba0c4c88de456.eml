Back at you! And congrats - Made By Us looks amazing!!

Things here are good; almost no virus, kids are loving their local school,
and we're folding in virtual schooling from NYC for a more holistic
package. Sadly, it looks like we have to dissolve our apartment (and hence
life) in NYC, so we're in an intermediate state atm. But opportunity, as
ever, looms. There has been so much positive learning from this pandemic
that I'm really, really grateful for! Let me know if I can be of service to
you or yours; helping the people I believe in is a big goal for me
going forward.
