I got sent this by two different sources who said that this sounded both
bombastic and realistic. I've seen enough scenario planning to know that
there's a lot this fellow doesn't know, but damn if I know how much.
Curious what your take is!

Hope you and yours are doing well; we're settling into Iceland for the
duration. Always happy to have guests. :)

All best,
Josh
