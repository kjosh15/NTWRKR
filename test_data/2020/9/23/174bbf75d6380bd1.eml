           Sorry, meant to follow up; I had a behaviour similar to what you=
 described when I had screwed the disk down too tightly and it was affectin=

           Have you tried detaching the two switches?=C2=A0 The pins that c=
ontrol the coin detector are odd, they are the interrupt detector pins and,=
 betraying my hazy knowledge and magical thinking when it comes to electron=
ics, in my box I had some problem with activity in one of the lid switches =
&quot;bleeding over&quot; into the interrupt detector, so I remapped those =
to non-adjacent pins in the code and it worked after that, I mean for while=
, a seagull has since destroyed my coin channel, but that&#39;s another pro=
blem!

           So, you have probably tried this but I would suggest unplugging =
both switches and seeing if mode 3 works.

            To clarify, yes, it still does the same thing. Does that point =
to something other than the servo itself acting up?

                  Hi folks!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <div>
                   I got my crowbox built and got to the stage of function =
testing (electronics stage 5) and things seemed to be working properly... b=
ut then not quite. During the stage 2 testing, the sliding lid behaved as e=
xpected when one of the switches was pushed, but when the other was pushed =
it would not wait before closing but would instead wait just a second or tw=
o before closing halfway, opening again, and then waiting another second or=
 two before doing the normal incremental close. The next time around, it di=
d the same thing, with only the other switch (seemed to be the second one p=
ushed either way?)
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   <br>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   Stage 3 and stage 4 saw this weird behavior again of sta=
rting to close up again right away after a coin was passed through, then op=
ening again, then normal incremental close. And in the 20 minutes I&#39;ve =
sat here mulling, it&#39;s just now decided to open and close on its own wh=
ile sitting at stage 3.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   <br>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   So I had been suspecting something wrong with the switch=
es, but the fact that it&#39;s doing the same thing in stage 3/4 when the s=
witches have no effect seems like it points to something else. Servo? Ardui=
no? Something not quite right with the wiring? This is my first project of =
this sort so I&#39;m not sure how to troubleshoot. Though I do note that my=
 servo seems to take quite a while of whirring to itself when it&#39;s boot=
ing and getting parked after I power on or hit the reset, about twice as lo=
ng as it seems to take in the videos.
