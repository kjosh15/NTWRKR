I'm coming to a place where it feels like we're inoculating each side
against the other - i.e., we can use the technology to help each side
improve how they communicate with the other to reach consensus. Sort of an
anti-social technology in which the motivation is to increase accord
instead of divisiveness, using the same techniques used by Facebook and
others in the first place.

The media piece feels key to this because it's the last bastion of
consensual reality; online every individual's experience is catered and
personalized to drive extremism (n=C3=A9e consumerism, or alternatively
political action/inaction.) But TV is still a generalist experience. If we
can algorithmically generate content that can be presented to both the
right and the left (even separately) but which brings each side into
greater sympathy to the other then we'll have made something dramatically
new.

Gotta get me more coffee, but there's my $0.02 prior to our call. :)

best,
Josh
