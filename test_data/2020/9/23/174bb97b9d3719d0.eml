on LinkedIn about your new role, and was absolutely thrilled by it. This is
a completely ballsy move if you don't mind me saying so, and exactly and
completely the kind of leadership that's decisively needed now more than
ever.

The challenge you're facing is practically addressing something most people
seem satisfied to wave their hands at, and that won't get the job done. If
there is *any* way I can help put my shoulder to the wheel there, please
let me know. I last spoke with Stephen Cook before you took your role -
what's changed?

Sincerely,
Josh
