                <div>Thanks for reaching out! I&#39;m recently moved to Ice=
land, and am in the process of negotiating a new contract (I&#39;m a freela=

 payments, which will then issue a salary to me personally.<br>
<br>
Iceland has a double taxation treaty with the USA, which I *believe* means =
that:<br>
<br>
1. I&#39;ll be taxed by the US only on the salary I accrue from my Icelandi=
c LLC, not the income to the LLC itself, and<br>
<br>
2. The exact amount I&#39;ll be taxed depends on how much my salary exceeds=
 the foreign earned income exclusion (~$105,900 for 2019, IIR), and<br>
<br>
3. I will need to file with the IRS regardless of what I do, which you can =
help with, and there are a variety of exclusions and other tricks we can us=
e to further limit the amount of salary I can draw without being taxed by t=
he US.<br>
<br>
If these statements are all true then I&#39;m ready to move forward. Can yo=
u help me confirm?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

 myself; I&#39;m currently in Iceland and looking at either setting up an L=
LC here (which will contract to my clients and then pay me a salary) or fin=
ish out the year being paid through my US LLC. I&#39;ve got two big questio=
ns I need answered before I can proceed. Am I right that: 1. I&#39;ll be ta=
xed only on the salary I accrue from my Icelandic LLC, not the income to th=
e LLC itself, and 2. The exact amount depends on how much my salary exceeds=
 the $130 annual amount and which mechanisms are used to discount it? If yo=
u can help me with that I&#39;ll be able to move to the next step! Thanks m=
uch, Josh</td>
