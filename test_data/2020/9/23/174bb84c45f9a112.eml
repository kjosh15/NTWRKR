We just reserved a 5x10' unit on the 3rd floor at 31-07 20th Avenue startin=
g
on October 15th, 2020 for $107.00 / month (Reservation code: 33P9MQVUS)
through Sparefoot.com.

Can you tell me if we can buy a disc lock on move-in? Also, what do I need
to bring in to use my renter's insurance to meet your insurance
requirement, and can I submit it electronically online beforehand? Finally,
are there any other fees or requirements I need to know about?

Thanks!
Josh
