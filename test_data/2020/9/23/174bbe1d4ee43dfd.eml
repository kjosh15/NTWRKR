It's been a minute - my family relocated to Iceland for the interim, where
I'm getting a pretty spectacular view of both the EU and US markets.

Was curious how things are going on your end and if there's any potential
for collaboration; I've been sitting on my retainer work but the slowdown
in corporate activity is starting to look like it's passing and I'm eager
to dig into it. Let me know if it's worth a call to compare notes!

All best wishes,
Josh
