Just writing to say hi and to invite you to a call if you're interested in
comparing notes; my family relocated to Iceland this summer and the view of
innovation in the EU/US/Asia is pretty stellar from here.

Can't imagine you're not inundated with work, but I've always enjoyed your
views - if you've got some spare cycles I'd be happy to catch up!

All best wishes to you and yours,
Josh
