Sounds good. Feedback I got was that less than that wouldn't be seriously
considered by Bjork's team. I'm working on getting a direct introduction to
her manager, but it's likely that these questions will come up immediately
in any case.

My impression is that a short bulleted list on format would answer most of
these; i.e., "Streaming, 6 EPs, targeted at Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon in
that order, shot primarily in Iceland with CGI host" or something like
that.

More later,
Josh
