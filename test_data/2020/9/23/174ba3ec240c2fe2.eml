I thought a lot about the study you sent over during my morning run.

Two more cents: it feels like we can even refer to the =E2=80=9Cinoculatio=
n=E2=80=9D as a =E2=80=9Cprimer.=E2=80=9D That=E2=80=99s something =
that=E2=80=99s more attuned to media banter. The researchers in the UK =
study were simply priming audiences before they received the =
misinformation, no? That=E2=80=99s very similar to the way I=E2=80=99ve =
thought about the editorial process in general. Priming people for =
information they are about to receive is something video editors think =
about, screenwriters think about, etc.

And in that way, it=E2=80=99s interesting to think that the primer could =
even be a character=E2=80=94one with no opinion, ie our AI. Something =
with an omniscient, nonpartisan perspective. But we need a relatable =
element as well, a relatable character. I wonder if that means pairing a =
climate change non-believer with the AI and, together, watching them =
figure it out together.

All quite nitty gritty for a topic we=E2=80=99re still thinking broadly =
about=E2=80=A6

I love your thought on TV. That's dead on. Digital is compromised for =
lack of a better term.

TV does, however, come with disadvantages. Big ones. We both know this =
process, and if a development exec sniffs climate change propaganda =
campaign, all bets are off. So as I said, in a less than understandable =
way in my late night email, I do think that our biggest challenge will =
be getting this onto a channel frequented by the demo we want, ie =
Discovery Channel or the History Channel, etc.

That is worth thinking about as we chat, as it informs absolutely =
everything.
