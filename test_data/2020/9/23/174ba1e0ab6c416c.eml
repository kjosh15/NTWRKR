Devon,

Was staring at the cieling in the middle of the night last night and
realized that a big chunk of my bookshelf in NYC is those harvard classics
books that lived in my bedroom downstairs for so many years.

Given that we don't have a home at the moment, and that you have a brand
new one, I thought these might be a classy addition if they were of
interest to you. Let me know if this is even remotely interesting!

xoxo,
Josh
