Thanks Josh =F0=9F=98=8A

I am so happy to hear you're in Iceland now! I have started to have to
limit my news intake about the states so that I can sleep at night. When
all this Covid stuff finally abates we should plan a visit either here or
there, I have yet to meet your partner or your offspring!

Warm regards,

Marti
