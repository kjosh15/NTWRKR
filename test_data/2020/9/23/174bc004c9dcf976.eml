Dear Friends and Family,



Happy Equinox!!! Fall has arrived in Ireland, schools are back in session
and throngs of plaid uniformed students can be spotted up and down our
local streets.  We want to wish all our friends and family suffering
through the smoke from the west coast wildfires and those on the Gulf Coast
facing an unprecedented storm season clear skies in your near future.
Unfortunately,
our Covid-19 numbers are going up as the cooler weather approaches. Pubs
are open again for most of the country but because of our numbers here in
the capitol, the taps remain dry.  We have also lost the privilege of
eating inside restaurants.  For the most part people continue to follow the
guidelines, keep social distance and wear masks.  There are of course a few
here and there but they are not affiliated with any Irish political party,
our governmental parties all seem to be on the side of science and the
truth.  Matt Damon has been spotted back on the Island, so I assume his
latest project is back in production.  Also, there has been great
celebration for Irish Cyclist Sam Bennett as he took the Green Jersey at
the Tour De France, I=E2=80=99m sure that Dennis or my father could explain=
 to me
exactly what this means but it has been a heart-warming story here.  Our
lives were thrown for a loop last month and there is much to catch you up
on.



The Irish Medical System

Eric went into the office for the first time since March to get his laptop
reimaged.  He forgot his badge and then forgot to return the temporary
badge before biking home.  So, the next day, he biked back to the office to
return the badge.  It started raining on his way home and as he turned the
corner to the entrance to our apartments his back wheel slid out.  He was
clipped in and his clips failed to release resulting in a broken Fibula.  W=
e
went to the urgent care center where he saw a doctor, got x-rays and got a
cast all in less than an hour and a half only filling out one form and at
no cost to us.  The next day he met with an orthopedic surgeon at 8:30 a.m.
and it was determined that Eric would need surgery due to the angle of the
fracture. His surgery was scheduled for 12:30 p.m. the same day, he was
given a Covid-19 test prior to the surgery that came back negative in 20
minutes.  He was back home by 7:30 p.m. with a titanium plate and 6 screws
installed.  He is now out of his cast and has what we are calling a space
boot.  Hopefully, he will be cleared for PT next week.



A Heavy Burden

The biggest change for me since Eric=E2=80=99s accident is the shopping. Ou=
r weekly
routine has been the butcher and veggie stand on Tuesdays and the grocery
on Wednesdays.  This routine has continued except now instead of splitting
the items between to the two of us, I am carrying everything.  This means
that I usually make an extra trip to SuperValu every week to get some of
the heavier items like apple juice and coconut water.  On the upside, I
feel as though I will be in great shape for hiking come spring, anyone
interested in hiking Wicklow way?  Eric is doing all he can to help without
putting weight on his foot.  He is now grinding my coffee every morning and
has become the designated folder of the laundry.

Another change is that I have been cooking much more which I am enjoying
getting back into.  I have learned so much over the last few weeks.  While
making fauxtesserie chicken, I learned to halve the garlic clove splitting
all of the cloves in half before stuffing it in the bird.  I learned to put
the cumin in with the onions while sauteing them for Mexican rice, it makes
the house smell amazing, I also learned that garlic should only be added a
minute before the onions are done.  I learned how to properly slice onions
from root to stem while making French Onion soup.  And finally, I learned
that two cups of black beans make an expletive ton of refried black beans
enough for quesadillas, migas, two breakfast burritos, one taco plate and
six black bean burgers.



A Sustainable Future

Eric and I have decided that we are going to purchase a house here in
Ireland.  We have procured the necessary finances and will be viewing our
first potential property on Monday.  We are looking for something with some
land that is not too far a drive back to Dublin for when Eric has to go
into the office.  There are several Bed and Breakfast properties available,
as a result of Covid, and some come with the furniture included which would
be great for us as we are renting a furnished apartment and our owned
furniture currently consists of a patio set, two yoga balls and two
mattress toppers.  We will let you know when we decide on a location.  This
means we will also be getting a car and will both be subjected to taking
driver=E2=80=99s education lessons, a requirement for those coming from the=
 states.
 We will however be exempted from the learner=E2=80=99s permit portion so l=
ong as
we both pass our exams.



It has been very convenient living here in this apartment.  I will miss not
having a car and my daily bike rides to the UCD campus to swim and
especially the 50 meter pool!  I am looking forward to having some
property, getting a dog and establishing an orchard.



That=E2=80=99s all for now.  We wish all of you the best and are continuing=
 to hope
that the American Institutions hold and that Democracy prevails! I just got
my ballot in the e-mail!



Love to you all,



Marti and Eric
