Joshua,
  If you want to see our air quality, this interactive map will show it to y=
ou. Walla Walla is on the WA-OR border South and East of Kennewick. As of 5:=
00PM Monday we are down - =F0=9F=99=81 - to 327. However, the weather system=
 they expected to come through today didn=E2=80=99t, unfortunately. Your mot=
her got on Amazon after looking at Wirecutters and - guess what - air filter=
s are out of stock (of course).=20
  We are doing well and even though an aqi (Air Quality Index) of 327 is haz=
ardous, it is noticeably less irritating than the 400 to 450 we had over the=
 weekend.
  To see various air measurements, go to:

Love,
DAD
