No apologies necessary - as the Dr. said, I=E2=80=99m in very good shape al=
l
things considered and shouldn=E2=80=99t be held back from doing anything ba=
rring
very heavy weighted squats (which I did quite a lot of two years ago...)
Rather it=E2=80=99s something to keep an eye on and watch for; if I DO deve=
lop an
injury it=E2=80=99s likely to be around those spots.

So in some ways it=E2=80=99s good news - it=E2=80=99s something I can watch=
 for and
accommodate to avoid injury.

Glad to hear the air quality is improving!! Are you guys feeling ok, or is
the bad air noticeable?

Love,
Josh
