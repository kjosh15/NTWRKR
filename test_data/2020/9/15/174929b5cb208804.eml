Joshua,

At 9:00AM aqi os =E2=80=9Conly=E2=80=9D 220 - listed as =E2=80=9CVery Unheal=
thy=E2=80=9D. We=E2=80=99re a whole lot better than 466 - Hazardous, which i=
s where I think we were over the weekend. It really is noticeably better. Ye=
s, we are still staying inside.=20

Last evening we went in and picked up our Walmart order. It was eerie how fe=
w cars were on the roads or people were to be seen. People appear to be taki=
ng this seriously. More so, it seems, than COVID-19.=20

Love,
DAD
