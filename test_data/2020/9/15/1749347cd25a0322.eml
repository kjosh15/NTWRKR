Joshua,

The 1st image (from the front) looks like you may have inherited my scoliosi=
s (curvature of the spine). =E2=80=98Sorry =E2=80=98bout that.=20

The second injury looks terrible! I have no recollection of anything like th=
is except, perhaps when you were a baby and fell down the basement stairs (f=
ortunately, into a pile of dirty laundry). Otherwise, could you have taken a=
 bad fall while =E2=80=98boarding? Or, how about during one of your Marshall=
 Arts sessions? I have no other guesses, and that=E2=80=99s all the above ar=
e as well.=20

FYI, AQI still listed as 228.=20

You will be interested in YouTube/Bread Code/The earth isn=E2=80=99t flat an=
d neither is sourdough and same author, Five tips to create incredible dough=
 strength.=20

Again, I=E2=80=99m so sorry you have back problems, congenital or not.=20

Love,
DAD
