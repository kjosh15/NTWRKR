Happy Friday! Curious to hear what's new in your world; as the US swirls
ever closer to the drain I am becoming ever more interested in innovation
in the EU...

I've got two projects I'd love your feedback on:

1. The new IndigoMetrics deck
<http://ghettosommelier.com/IndigoMetrics_v2_090820.pdf>. We've been
working with Big Spaceship to do a marketing revamp and this is the current
iteration. This is our general overview deck; does it make sense to you?
How would you make it more compelling?

2. I'm looking to launch my media outreach campaign Monday (complete
strategy overview here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0=
-BG_0/edit?usp=3Dsharing>)
to try to leverage my network more effectively in our newly virtualized
world. This is basically a multivariate testing framework to see how best
to cultivate and vet distant connections, but thought you might find it
interesting given your own networking efforts.

As ever, please let me know if I can help you with any of your own ventures=
!

Hope you're well,
Josh
