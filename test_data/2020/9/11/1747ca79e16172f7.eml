Happy Friday! How's the new gig treating you, and are you above water
enough to set a call to discuss? I'm *very* curious to hear what you're
going to be doing over there, esp. given the opportunity space in the
finance world right now...

Separately, I'm launching my outreach campaign this week, with two project
decks I'd love your feedback on:

1. The new IndigoMetrics deck
<http://ghettosommelier.com/IndigoMetrics_v2_090820.pdf>. We've been
working with Big Spaceship to do a marketing revamp and this is the current
iteration. This is our general overview deck; does it make sense to you?
How would you make it more compelling?

2. CGM Pitch deck
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=3Dsharing>.
I'm getting close to pitching this to potential investors and have
incorporated your most recent feedback. Does it make sense to you? How
would you make it more compelling?

Otherwise I'm looking to launch my media outreach campaign Monday (complete
strategy overview here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0=
-BG_0/edit?usp=3Dsharing>)
in case you're curious about how I'm trying to leverage my network in our
newly virtualized world. Happy to share the results as I get them; this is
basically a multivariate testing framework to see how best to cultivate and
vet distant connections.

As ever, please let me know if I can help you with any of your own ventures=
!

Hope you're well,
Josh
