Thanks Josh!

Quick question... As I go through some of the tables with score numbers on
the platform, it seems like you guys are applying a color code per values.
For instance, numbers running from 4 to 3.5 seem to use a certain blue, 3.5
to 2.0 uses a different color, etc. Do you have with you some info around
that?   I could assume what the color application is by reading the tables
but I would rather not make any assumptions.

Cheers!
