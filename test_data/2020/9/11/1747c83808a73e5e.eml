Hi Kristin,

Thanks for the participant list and the comms updates. We have uploaded the
data to the platform and accepted the changes on the comms with one change
from our side - we are suggesting calling the score the "IndigoMetrics
Score" rather than the "Workplace Culture Score" - we have started taking
this approach to land the score in white space and avoid preconceptions
around phrases such as "culture" and "soft skills".

Can we do a test now to check that you are happy how the comms look in
"live" format and to check that we don't have email or firewall issues with
your servers?

If its OK with you I'll trigger off a test review and you will receive Comm2
welcoming you and asking you to log on. When you have created a password,
the platform will ask you to review 2 test accounts. If you could log on and
complete the reviews to check we don't have any firewall issues that would
be great.

Once you are in the platform could you also click on the "Heat Map" tab to
take a look at the org structure we have uploaded. Our permissions work such
that a "line manager" can see the scores of everyone in their own team or
that is in a team that is a child of their team - so we added a few extra
layers in an attempt to reflect the reporting structure on the google sheets
file. If you would like anything changed please let us know - its really
easy to modify the structure.

Once this test is complete we will be ready to go from our side and it is
just a case of agreeing the date the first review is sent out, we recommend
these go out on Tuesdays as this generally gets the highest engagement.

Thanks and Regards

Chris
