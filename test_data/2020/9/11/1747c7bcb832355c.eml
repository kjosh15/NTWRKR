Hello Josh,

I do apologize for the confusion but we did send you an email on August
20th and August 22nd informing you of the USPS "Change of add form" you
would have to fill out to have your mail routed to you.
I did paste the link below that will direct you to the USPS "Change of
address form" but I will not be able to submit a refund request for you.

Kind Regards.



How would you rate my reply?
Great    Okay    Not Good
