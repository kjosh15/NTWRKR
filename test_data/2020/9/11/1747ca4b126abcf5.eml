Happy Friday! I hope you're doing well over there in the on-fire state...

I'm launching my outreach campaign this week, with two project decks I'd
love your feedback on:

1. The new IndigoMetrics deck
<http://ghettosommelier.com/IndigoMetrics_v2_090820.pdf>. We've been
working with Big Spaceship to do a marketing revamp and this is the current
iteration. This is our general overview deck; does it make sense to you?
How would you make it more compelling?

2. CGM Pitch deck
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1epRbFnMTK4xpSTnTGZkn-Uh1asBvSmOkel=
Wdz8F-K_g/edit?usp=3Dsharing>.
I'm getting close to pitching this to potential investors. Similarly, does
it make sense to you? How would you make it more compelling?

Otherwise I'm looking to launch my media outreach campaign Monday (complete
strategy overview here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/16A0SIjUpTgX-181yJ9qKEUgRtNLSpLDpoG1bu0=
-BG_0/edit?usp=3Dsharing>)
in case you're curious about how I'm trying to leverage my network in our
newly virtualized world. Happy to share the results as I get them; this is
basically a multivariate testing framework to see how best to cultivate and
vet distant connections.

As ever, please let me know if I can help you with any of your own ventures=
!

Hope you're well,
Josh
