Valerie,

I checked on MySchools.nyc and it says he's accepted the Ella Baker
enrollment offer. Are there any remaining forms we need to provide? I
checked at https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollmentforms but there's no
indication of what is due, if anything. Just making sure nothing is pending
that could cause problems!

Hope you're well, and thanks!
Josh
