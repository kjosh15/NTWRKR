Do you have time for a call this week or next? I feel like the CGM deck is
in pretty good shape, I have a good line up of potential partners, and it's
time to decide on when/how to push forward. I'd really value your advice if
you're available - and also to hear if/how you'd like to be involved!

Hope you're well,
Josh
