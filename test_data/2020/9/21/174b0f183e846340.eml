                   I got my crowbox built and got to the stage of function =
testing (electronics stage 5) and things seemed to be working properly... b=
ut then not quite. During the stage 2 testing, the sliding lid behaved as e=
xpected when one of the switches was pushed, but when the other was pushed =
it would not wait before closing but would instead wait just a second or tw=
o before closing halfway, opening again, and then waiting another second or=
 two before doing the normal incremental close. The next time around, it di=
d the same thing, with only the other switch (seemed to be the second one p=
ushed either way?)
                  </div>
                  <div>

                  </div>
                  <div>
                   Stage 3 and stage 4 saw this weird behavior again of sta=
rting to close up again right away after a coin was passed through, then op=
ening again, then normal incremental close. And in the 20 minutes I've sat =
here mulling, it's just now decided to open and close on its own while sitt=
ing at stage 3.

                  <div>
                   So I had been suspecting something wrong with the switch=
es, but the fact that it's doing the same thing in stage 3/4 when the switc=
hes have no effect seems like it points to something else. Servo? Arduino? =
Something not quite right with the wiring? This is my first project of this=
 sort so I'm not sure how to troubleshoot. Though I do note that my servo s=
eems to take quite a while of whirring to itself when it's booting and gett=
ing parked after I power on or hit the reset, about twice as long as it see=
ms to take in the videos.
