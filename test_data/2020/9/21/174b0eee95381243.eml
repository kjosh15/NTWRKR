Julie,

I'm getting confirmation later today about how much of our stuff we think
our current tenant could pack for us in advance. How soon do you need us to
put a stake in the ground? I don't want to book time from you without being
more certain, but also don't want to lose a slot - please advise on what
could work for you!

best,
Josh

<div>Yes. That is all correct. Bringing the furniture to a NJ shipping cent=
er would be around $1500. I could give you a real estimate when we see the =
apartment for packing. I think I only had those photos that gave me an idea=
 of what you were taking.
 My questions would be about built in cabinets and what furniture you would=
 be taking. An inventory of items would be helpful. It will take much less =
time than the packing, but it is traveling farther. - Julie=C2=A0

<div>Hello Josh, I don=E2=80=99t think that the local storage places will l=

will have reasonable storage costs. I think it would be better for you to r=

 Any place on Northern blvd or in the area. Extra space, Cube smart, Public=
 Storage is not my favorite. There are so many. Its important to ask about =
move in and out fees and whether the price changes and how often.=C2=A0 Whe=

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hello Jochen, <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thank you for those photos. Lets assume that if we packed just the=
 boxes, art, lamps=E2=80=A6everything but the furniture, that you would nee=
d a 10 x 15 storage unit. I think that you could ship a 20 foot container, =
or 26 feet of a 40 foot if you want to take furniture.
 We often work with Transcontainer Transport for overseas shipping. Prices =
would come from them and they would hire us to do the loading of the contai=
ner. We could also put it all in a truck and bring it to their warehouse.
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We would like to price your pack and move to local storage in Quee=
ns at $2000 that would be packing everything and bringing just the boxes, n=
ot the large furniture. Adding the furniture would be another $1000. If you=
 need us to bring the whole load to Claudia
 Carby at Transcontainer Transport we could do that for $3000. These are so=
rt of average prices assuming that you have a master bedroom that we don=E2=
=80=99t see and a kitchen and all of the things that people live with. You =
have lots of storage room and shelving.
 It looks like you have a lot of stuff and some rooms that we are not seein=
g. That said, these pictures are enough for me to get a good idea.
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The price includes all travel time, fuel charges and tolls. We do =
not charge for parking tickets. Your price includes a one time use mattress=
 bag for your mattress, general disassembly and reassembly of furniture pie=
ces if needed, the use of our equipment
 such as wardrobes or dollies and the wrapping of larger items and furnitur=
e. <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We are assuming that everything fits in and out of the locations. =
If any items do not fit we will have to leave them in an agreed upon safe l=
ocation. We will wrap all of the furniture in blankets and bring reusable w=
ardrobes for your hanging clothing.
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; All furniture that we take apart on your move will be put together=
 on the other side. Please keep in mind that we cannot insure particle boar=
d furniture like Ikea.=C2=A0 The joints have not been glued and the backing=
s are often stapled masonite. It never quite
 returns to its original condition when assembled and disassembled. We can =
also not insure nature stone or drift wood type natural objects that may ha=
ve a weakened vein or hidden structural defect that prevents them from hand=
ling the stress of the move. Thin
 sheets of marble should be crated in a padded wooden crate. That said, it =
is sometimes not worth the cost of the piece to build a crate for the movem=
ent of a marble item. We do try our best to move marble pieces in cardboard=
 and blankets, but we can not insure
 marble or stone pieces. <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This was based on an hourly rate of $250 an hour for 4 men and a t=
ruck for 8 hours to pack and bring you to local storage. Another 3 men at $=
200 an hour for 5 hours to bring the furniture to storage, and again, 5 hou=
rs to bring it to Carteret, load it and
 return, 15 minutes to get to the job and 15 minutes to get away is include=
d in those estimates. If you think that we have over estimated the time, yo=
u are welcome to pay for the move hourly.
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This estimate is based on your list and comments:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &lt;apt1.jpeg&gt;&lt;apt6.jpeg&gt;&lt;apt5.jpeg&gt;&lt;apt4.jpeg&g=
t;&lt;apt2.jpeg&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Extra valuation is not always necessary, but if you would like to =
purchase it, we are insurable up to $25,000. The cost would be $5.00 per th=
ousand dollars of depreciated value coverage. We cannot insure particle boa=
rd furniture (such as IKEA brand pieces),
 however we will do our best to protect and carefully transport any items o=
f this nature. Your building and the workers are always covered under our g=
eneral liability and workers compensation insurance. If your building is in=
terested in viewing our documents,
 please let us know and we can provide them. <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Tipping of movers is optional, but customary in NYC and usually ar=
ound 15% -20% of the move divided evenly among the movers.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Below is a link to a helpful document made by the NY State Departm=
ent of Transportation. It is a Summary of Information for Shippers of House=
hold Goods. Every moving company is required to pass it on to their clients=
.
