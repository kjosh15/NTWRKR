Hey comrade,
   We made it! Living in Menlo Park, mere blocks from Sand Hill Road. We
dodged any wildfires on the way here; the more immediate concern is that
the air quality got bad enough that folks were advised to stay indoors and
turn on air filters, and one day the sky turned Total Recall orange all day
long, which was freakish. Stanford is locked down, so we're all working
from home for a while, but I'm taking long bike rides through the foothills
and remembering what I liked about this place.
   Hey, did you take that CFO job? I have been thinking about it a bunch,
and realized that this could be a portent of a new way to organize work.
Hiring for a single "job" of 40ish hours/week is kind of like shopping at
Costco: they usually have what you want, but you often have to buy it in a
much larger package than you need. (1.5 gallons of white vinegar, srsly?)
Picture a labor market that looks more like my local food coop (pre Covid),
where you buy the precise amount you want from a giant bin.
