Agreed on all fronts except that I think we can dig deeper than Mark
Hammond. For example, I've done some work with Jaron Lanier (although I
don't know if he'd bite on my call), and Doug Rushkoff could probably
suggest some folks. It'd be interesting to see who at Google might respond,
esp. as they're competitive to GPT-3. I.e., with a little more digging I
think we could get closer - are you game for helping me define what sort of
resources would be best fit? I'm game to reach out to anyone, and have
plenty of tech access, but feel like I'm missing the mark on congruence
with funding/name advantage. Call later this week to refine?

happening this week.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>1. The Social Dilemma, =
a new Netflix documentary came out, making many of the arguments that peopl=
e like me, Sherry Turkle, Cliff Nass, Howard Rheingold, Andrew Keen, Evgeny=
 Morozov, Astra Taylor, Richard Barbrook, Nick Carr, Mark Bauerlain, and ev=
en Raffi have been making about the impact of social media manipulation on =
our psyche and society for many years. Only in the movie, it&#39;s the tech=
 guys who actually made these platforms who are blowing the whistle on thei=
r own previous misdeeds.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m getting lot=
s of very supportive email from people who recognize our words and metaphor=
s coming out of the mouths of the contrite tech developers - but I think it=
&#39;s important we don&#39;t get possessive about our work. This is not ab=
out getting credit, but saving our very society.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div>=
<div>Our bigger goal should be to try to get some of these new tech reforme=
rs to divest from their holdings in Facebook, Google, and the other compani=
es aiming at our brainstems. If, like they&#39;re saying, these companies a=
re as big an existential threat to humanity as climate change, then it does=
n&#39;t make sense to have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars invested=
 in them. It&#39;s like holding stock in cigarette or oil companies. We can=
&#39;t profit off the harm.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve got a m=
onologue about this that opens <a href=3D"https://teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-=
165-helen-pluckrose-and-james-lindsay-toward-justice-for-all/" target=3D"_b=

ests, the authors of <i>Cynical Theories</i>, Helen Pluckrose and James Lin=
dsay.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>2. I have a new big piece in GEN on Me=
dium. You can read it <a href=3D"https://gen.medium.com/the-gop-stole-satir=
e-from-the-left-6f373b8e5bad" target=3D"_blank">online here</a>, or I have =
pasted it below.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll write again in the=
 next week or so with some upcoming stuff and thoughts about where we are r=
ight now as a society. I don&#39;t think this whole thing has to fall apart=
, but it could. Accepting that possibility doesn&#39;t have to trigger fear=
; it can also inspire new resolve.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div><br></div=
><div><b>THIS IS NOT A DRESS</b></div><div><b>How the Right Stole Operation=
 Mindfuck from the Left</b></div><div><br></div><div><div>I still remember =
when it was the Left who had more fun. It wasn=E2=80=99t just that they wer=
e younger and had better hair, music, and drugs (though all of that certain=
ly helped); it was that the Left was fabulously irreverent. Whether nominat=
ing a pig for president, or raining dollar bills on the New York Stock Exch=
ange, these were pranksters and media activists who tweaked their noses at =
authority and undermined the foundations of consensus society.=C2=A0</div><=
div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s Trump and QAnon who have taken on th=
at countercultural mantle, using the media available at their disposal to d=
estabilize fact-based reality and promote conspiracy theories=E2=80=94and t=
o do it all so cheekily that we can=E2=80=99t even tell if they actually be=
lieve what they=E2=80=99re saying.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Trump=E2=
=80=99s gaslighting calls to mind the 1960s counterculture at its most effe=
ctive, when satirists and pranksters began applying some of the principles =
of postmodern art to protest. At its core, postmodernism was about rejectin=
g big, overarching ideologies. If we could deconstruct these top-down narra=
tives, the philosophy held, then we=E2=80=94the formerly passive spectators=
=E2=80=94could have as much power over the perception of reality as the aut=
horities broadcasting it. The trick was simply to sow doubt by enacting stu=
nts that make people question their own belief systems, revealing accepted =
truths as arbitrary illusions.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Although Euro=
peans have understood the power of postmodernism since the Dadaists, in Ame=
rica it was probably counterculture writer Paul Krassner who first weaponiz=
ed the idea, publishing the first intentionally =E2=80=9Cfake news=E2=80=9D=
 story in his satirical magazine The Realist. Meant as an antidote to the a=
nodyne treatment of John F. Kennedy=E2=80=99s assassination by mainstream b=
ooks and articles, Krassner=E2=80=99s piece claimed that while the presiden=
t=E2=80=99s body was being transported on Air Force One, Jackie Kennedy wal=
ked in Lyndon Johnson sexually penetrating the exit wound in her husband=E2=
=80=99s skull. Given LBJ=E2=80=99s well-known crudity and lust for power, t=
he myth gained traction as both news and metaphor.=C2=A0</div><div><br></di=
v><div>Likewise, we saw Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and the Yippies declari=
ng in 1967 that they were =E2=80=9Cnow in the business of wholesale disrupt=
ion and widespread resistance and dislocation of the American society,=E2=
=80=9D and embark on a project to encircle the Pentagon in order to levitat=
e it and exorcise it from evil. As Allen Ginsberg explained, =E2=80=9CThe P=
entagon was symbolically levitated in people=E2=80=99s minds in the sense t=
hat=E2=80=A6the authority of the Pentagon psychologically was dissolved.=E2=
=80=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Robert Anton Wilson eventually claime=
d all of this activity as part of =E2=80=9COperation Mindfuck=E2=80=9D=E2=
=80=94the collective countercultural effort to destabilize myth surrounding=
 the American Dream. What made these performative, po-mo protests work so w=
ell was that they were cheeky. While their ultimate intentions were of exis=
tential importance=E2=80=94ending the Vietnam War, race murder, and economi=
c oppression=E2=80=94they didn=E2=80=99t take themselves seriously at all. =
This is part of what made them so powerful. How do you fight a clown?=C2=A0=
</div><div><br></div><div>Today, it=E2=80=99s the orange man playing the pa=
rt of the clown, with QAnon as his Yippie minions, pranking the public with=
 fake news and metaphorical stunts that work whether or not they=E2=80=99re=
 taken seriously. In fact, the less serious they seem, the more wiggle room=
 they create=E2=80=94for confusion in the audience, and denial by the prank=
ster.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The Republican National Convention may=
 have been the most blatant celebration of authoritarianism in American his=
tory, but it was also postmodern theater. An appearance by a couple whose s=
ole qualification for speaking was having waved guns at BLM protestors marc=
hing by their home; Melania Trump dressed in a military-themed outfit almos=
t identical to Hitler=E2=80=99s; Melania following up the next night in a c=
hroma-key green dress, as if to say =E2=80=9Cproject onto me whatever you w=
ant=E2=80=9D; and Trump himself responding to accusations that it was illeg=
al to use the Rose Garden for a campaign by acknowledging his White House b=
ackdrop and joking, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re here, they=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=
=9D=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>The progressive Twitterverse responded t=
o each taunt with greater outrage, posting side-by-side comparisons of Mela=
nia=E2=80=99s epaulettes to Hitler=E2=80=99s, scoffing at Trump=E2=80=99s u=
se of the White House as a set piece, and dutifully superimposing anti-Trum=
p imagery on Melania=E2=80=99s chroma key dress. Triggered, provoked, and d=
estabilized, the Left loses touch with whatever issues it may hold dear, dr=
awn instead into a frenzy of speculation about Trump=E2=80=99s rhetorical p=
yrotechnics. =C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Did the Trumps really mean to =
accomplish all this? Maybe. Maybe not. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter, as long a=
s we obsess over trying to figure it out. This is the desired effect=E2=80=
=94the mind fuck=E2=80=94of propaganda pranksterism. As Walter Lippmann, th=
e founder of the field of public relations, explained back in the 1920s: th=
e object of the game is to create a =E2=80=9Cpseudo environment=E2=80=9D be=
tween people and reality by simply =E2=80=9Cputting pictures into their hea=
ds.=E2=80=9D People=E2=80=99s imaginations take care of the rest.=C2=A0</di=
v><div><br></div><div>Trump has been able to seize the power of all this se=
miotic play because the left has relinquished it. In part, it=E2=80=99s bec=
ause the Left is now in the position of the top-down broadcasters, and Trum=
p has assumed the mantle of the countercultural rebel. Indeed, the Left =E2=
=80=9Cwon=E2=80=9D the culture wars. Mainstream society accepted=E2=80=94at=
 least the principle=E2=80=94that women, people of color, LGBTQ, and every =
intersectional group deserves equal rights. But this put the Left on defens=
e, always on alert for language and imagery that violated its hard-won cult=
ural victories.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, the artsy cheekin=
ess of Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner went from the streets of Haight Ashb=
ury to the ivory towers of academia. There, it became the dead serious disc=
ipline known as critical theory=E2=80=94an earnest analysis of the way lang=
uage and culture are controlled by those in power. In deconstructing the wa=
y the perceptions, labels, and language of a powerful group can be used to =
limit what seems possible for a less powerful one, they concluded that word=
s can be a form of violence. It=E2=80=99s at the heart of today=E2=80=99s i=
dentity politics, wokeism, and the Left=E2=80=99s high sensitivity to label=
s, language, and other triggers. And=E2=80=94when facing an adversary willi=
ng to say anything=E2=80=94it may also have become the Left=E2=80=99s Achil=
les=E2=80=99 heel.</div><div><br></div><div>Trump certainly sees it that wa=
y, which is why he=E2=80=99s so happy to deliver a daily dose of language a=
nd imagery guaranteed to get everyone on CNN, MSNBC, and my Twitter feed in=
 a tizzy. He said what???? That would be bad enough, but he=E2=80=99s also =
playing the spoilsport at the very same time, winking and nudging at the pr=
eposterousness of the game itself, as if to say, You saw a military dress o=
n Melania at the RNC? What do you project tonight onto her chromakey gown? =
It doesn=E2=80=99t even matter if he consciously realizes any of this at al=
l. Whether the result of strategy or intuition, it works.=C2=A0</div><div><=
br></div><div>Critical theory and the linguistic sensitivity it engendered =
doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be serving us very well as we attempt to fight back=
 against the post-modern antics of Trump and QAnon. Because now it=E2=80=99=
s the alt-right using pranksterism to promote fascism, and the formerly che=
eky Left now stranded in the hall of mirrors it once created to destabilize=
 the Old Guard. Word play and mindfuckery are great tools for revolution, b=
ut terrible ones for building consensus or sustainable civics. They can dis=
tract us from the real conditions on the ground, and the facts on which our=
 best arguments rest.</div><div><br></div><div>I don=E2=80=99t even think t=
his was entirely the Left=E2=80=99s fault. There=E2=80=99s more at play her=
e than an academic theory run aground on the shoals of the real world. It=
=E2=80=99s that the approach itself only really worked in the prior media e=
ra, when all we could really do is shout back at the TV screen. Interpretat=
ion and deconstruction are great for broadcast audiences. But we=E2=80=99re=
 not in a spectator democracy, anymore. We=E2=80=99re participants in a dig=
ital media environment. We=E2=80=99re not just hearing and watching things;=
 our responses become part of the story.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As =
computer scientist Norbert Wiener foretold, we=E2=80=99ve gone from command=
 and control to cybernetics. Our relationship to power is more like a feedb=
ack loop, where everything is both the cause and effect of everything else.=
 It=E2=80=99s impossible to parse whether the public is responding to the P=
resident, or if the President is responding to a Tweet, because it=E2=80=99=
s both.=C2=A0 BLM protests are a response to white abuse, yet white fear is=
 also a triggered response to Black protests, leading to more abuse, and th=
en more protests. There=E2=80=99s no longer a point of origin. It=E2=80=99s=
 as if no one and everyone is responsible. The feedback loop spins out into=
 a cycle of plausible deniability. The crazy 17-year-old is on the streets =
with a rifle, and people can=E2=80=99t agree whether he&#39;s a victim, a t=
errorist, or both.</div><div><br></div><div>These feedback loops are what s=
pun out the Tea Party and Occupy into the current culture war, only now, fu=
lly divorced from conditions on the ground or class consciousness. It=E2=80=
=99s all =E2=80=9Cout there=E2=80=9D on Twitter and cable TV, in symbolism,=
 framing, and word choice. But there&#39;s an actual way things are, which =
gets thrown out in the process. These culture wars concede reality itself. =
No one has any ground for discussion or engagement. And this is largely soc=
ial media&#39;s fault, in that we accept our algorithmically derived profil=
es as some measure of who we are.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>But when w=
e pull back and look at what=E2=80=99s going on here, we see a whole bunch =
of poor, disempowered people of every color being programmed by social medi=
a to fight against one another instead of against their mutual oppressors. =
And sure, they can each see how the other side is being manipulated=E2=80=
=94but can=E2=80=99t see how they, themselves, are being radicalized the sa=
me way.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>As this all spins out of control, we=
 find ourselves on the brink of what a full third of Americans believe may =
even become a civil war. People actually shooting each other in the streets=
 based on crazy ass fake bullshit=E2=80=94and giving more ammunition to a P=
resident and media that both thrive off this artificial and unnecessary con=
flict. Chaos and violence work in their favor=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what t=
he administration says out loud=E2=80=94because then cops get more nervous,=
 shoot more Black people, who then protest, who then bring out the Trumpers=
, who then create more chaos and violence.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>B=
ut as with all feedback loops, there=E2=80=99s a way to stop them.=C2=A0</d=
iv><div><br></div><div>Just like when a musician hears that awful screech o=
f feedback on stage, we must pull the microphone away from the speaker, or =
the speaker away from the microphone. It=E2=80=99s that simple. Break the c=
ycle. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean ignoring the news or our president=E2=80=99=
s online antics (though we could all ease up on the doom scrolling right no=
w) but maybe engaging with them in a different way. Not poised to reflexive=
ly tweet and retweet, but to slow down, pull back and understand.=C2=A0</di=
