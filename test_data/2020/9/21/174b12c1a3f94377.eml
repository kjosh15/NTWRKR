Ella Baker has always done things differently from other schools. So =
this doesn=E2=80=99t surprise me, but I am curious about tax exemption =
and I think most companies would ask the same question. I wonder if that =
needs to be part of the fine print.

If you do get any more images, please send them here or send them =
through wetransfer.com. I find it very hard to keep track of the images =
through the Google links, I=E2=80=99m not that familiar with all the =
Google stuff and I worry it will slow me down.

Thanks,
:Michelle
