Thanks for reaching out! I'm recently moved to Iceland, and am in the
process of negotiating a new contract (I'm a freelance consultant). I've
been advised to set up an Icelandic LLC to accept payments, which will then
issue a salary to me personally.

Iceland has a double taxation treaty with the USA, which I *believe* means
that:

1. I'll be taxed by the US only on the salary I accrue from my Icelandic
LLC, not the income to the LLC itself, and

2. The exact amount I'll be taxed depends on how much my salary exceeds the
foreign earned income exclusion (~$105,900 for 2019, IIR), and

3. I will need to file with the IRS regardless of what I do, which you can
help with, and there are a variety of exclusions and other tricks we can
use to further limit the amount of salary I can draw without being taxed by
the US.

If these statements are all true then I'm ready to move forward. Can you
help me confirm?

Thanks!
Josh

 myself; I&#39;m currently in Iceland and looking at either setting up an L=
LC here (which will contract to my clients and then pay me a salary) or fin=
ish out the year being paid through my US LLC. I&#39;ve got two big questio=
ns I need answered before I can proceed. Am I right that: 1. I&#39;ll be ta=
xed only on the salary I accrue from my Icelandic LLC, not the income to th=
e LLC itself, and 2. The exact amount depends on how much my salary exceeds=
 the $130 annual amount and which mechanisms are used to discount it? If yo=
u can help me with that I&#39;ll be able to move to the next step! Thanks m=
uch, Josh</td>
