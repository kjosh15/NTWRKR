Here's the refined pitch from my partner in Barcelona. Is this something
you're game to push here in Iceland? He seems to think it's very fundable.

best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

Starting a separate thread here for Ka=C3=B0l=C3=ADn of the Cold.

I=E2=80=99ve updated our one-sheet. Rereading it, I really think this is a =
great
one. A producer in my office today lept up after reading the one-sheet. And
I=E2=80=99m excited to expand upon the idea with a full treatment, if there=
=E2=80=99s
interest.

When you speak to your contact, please let them know that we=E2=80=99re kee=
n on
finding an executive producer and/or creative partner in Bjork or a similar
name there in Iceland.

And please feel free to reference the documentary we discussed last week,
The Social Dilemma. Documentary-drama hybrids are really catching steam in
the industry. It=E2=80=99s a fantastic way to draw entertainment audiences =
into
important issues.

And this particular series pulls together some very sticky, fundable and
marketable themes into one show.

   - An entertaining narrative
   - Climate change education
   - Icelandic musical acts
   - Icelandic culture and storytelling history
   - Beautiful Icelandic landscapes
