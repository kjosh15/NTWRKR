Sorry Josh, my bad. Use this one

"Technology is critical to any organization, but even more so in a design
firm that serves customers across every segment and in markets across the
globe. Josh helped us pull together a comprehensive document with deep
technical understanding and strong growth benchmarks that gave us the
framework we needed to move forward."

Where is it going to be used?

Iceland. Many balls beginning to roll. PM meting went well, she gets it.
Busy of course with COVID but a real sense that they need to invest in
building a portfolio with more depth and less obvious stuff like tourism.
Wants to build a creative =E2=80=9Ccenter.=E2=80=9D Now working heavily wit=

at the other. Doing a workshop with her in a new weeks, will share back as
soon as I have something.

Teaching is good but academia is way way political. Zzz

Other than that, just back from Dubai. Traveling internationally during the
whole covid thing was a total drama.
