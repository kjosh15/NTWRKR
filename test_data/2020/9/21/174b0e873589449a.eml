Takk, R=C3=A1n! To bcc.

=C3=81g=C3=BAst, if you can advise I'd be very grateful; I've been unable t=
o find
anyone in Iceland who can suggest what my tax burden would be in the US,
and nobody in the US seems to know anything about Iceland either. I have
confirmed from the Icelandic tax authorities that there is a double
taxation treaty, but no details on what that means.

To date the suggestions I've received have been (from Icelandic sources) to
set up an Icelandic LLC and pay myself a salary to avoid paying larger fees
on the Icelandic side, and (from US sources) to take payment directly under
my kennital to avoid huge filing fees on the US side. Any advice is
appreciated!

Sincerely,
Josh Klein
