<div>I used a lawyer, which I highly recommend. Is she looking to follow th=
is route, or is she planning to do it on her own? Off the top of my head th=
e big things I&#39;d wished I&#39;d known were:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>- The committee runs a vote twice a year, so timing on the language te=
st, criminal records, etc. all need to be oriented around this.
<br>
</div>
<div>- The CIA-approved criminal record forms are a royal PITA; pay a servi=
ce to get these stamped appropriately and returned quickly, if you can.</di=
v>
<div>- The language test isn&#39;t as daunting as it sounds, but they only =
hold them in Iceland and only art certain times of the year - so again, pla=
n accordingly.</div>

<div>Let me know what else I can do to help!</div>
