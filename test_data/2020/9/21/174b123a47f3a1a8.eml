I heard back from Betsy in regards to accepting payment:

"It does not need to go through the PTA.  Ella Baker School has its own
bank account.  A check can go straight in there."

I thought I'd write you on separate thread as you'd expressed some concerns
about how that could misfire in other fundraising efforts you'd been a part
of. Did you have any concerns based on Betsy's response, or should we just
accept it and charge forward?

best,
Josh
