Want to spend the $350? As long as we're doing more than 5 domains it's
price effective.

An alternative would be to use https://letsencrypt.org/

It would need to be renewed every 90 days, which we can probably set up to
happen automatically except if it doesn't, in which case we'd see downtime
for all subdomains.
