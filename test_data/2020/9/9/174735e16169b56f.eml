"and belief" because that is a class of meta influence on action that
differs from actual behavior. Otherwise tried to incorporate all your
changes. Let me know what you think about the below.

IndigoMetrics is an expert system that can change human behavior and belief
autonomously and at scale around any set of actions that can be peer
observed. It does this by creating a bias-adjusted, statistically relevant
expert model drawn from peer-to-peer evaluations of a company's core
values. This model then pairs anonymous suggestions based on value
disparities across the network graph to leverage social proof in creating
individual behavior change.

As a result, the system can also calculate relative movement in usually
hard-to-model elements such as D&I, psychological safety, innovation, and
more. This statistics allow for scaled multivariate tests of content,
experiences, and interactions that can cause additional system and
individual change.

IndigoMetrics would like to work with an academic institution to validate
the impact of its system as an example of a new class of algorithmic
influencing platform in order to enable new, more comprehensive, and more
critical use of this kind of technology going forward.
