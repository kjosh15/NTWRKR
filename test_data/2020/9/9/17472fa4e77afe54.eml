How's this for a paragraph summary for Michael? Let me know if you have
anything to add or if you can think of a better tack:

###

IndigoMetrics provides a bias-adjusted, statistically relevant model for
both behavior and belief by using an expert system on peer-to-peer
statements around a company's core values. This makes it possible to
calculate relative movements in usually hard-to-model elements such as D&I,
psychological safety, innovation, and more.

What's more, IndigoMetrics' expert system can pair qualitative feedback
with its peer relationship model to prompt behavior change using anonymous
suggestions. This allows it to change human behavior autonomously and at
scale.

As a growing class of expert systems, AI, and analytics enable this sort of
algorithmic influence in a variety of new markets, study is needed to
evaluate both the efficacy and impact. IndigoMetrics would like to work
with an academic institution to validate the impact of its system in order
to enable new, more comprehensive, and more critical use of this class of
technology going forward.
