I know you don't normally reply via email, but I'm unlikely to bump into
you at any f2f events these days and found myself wondering how you're
living. I'm in Iceland for the duration, and it's an interesting view on
the US vs. EU tech and innovation worlds from here. Just checking in to say
hi and compare notes; hit me back if you want to connect!

All best,
Josh
