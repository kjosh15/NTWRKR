How is life with El=C3=ADsabet away at school? I can only imagine - it soun=
ds
like such a strange transition!!

Things here are going well; the boys are doing well at their new school and
I'm busy negotiating some new contracts. Which leads me to two questions:

1. As part of your legal work do you ever broker the sale of Icelandic LLCs
as operating instruments? I've been working with PWC to figure out how to
manage my taxes, and they suggested creating an LLC to accept contract
income here in Iceland. I was told there is a "word of mouth" market for
these instruments (as buying one which is no longer being used may be
cheaper than creating a new one) and was curious if you have any insight.

2. Are you and your wife available for a walk sometime? Would be great to
catch up and compare notes on the fall in Iceland!

All best wishes,
Josh
