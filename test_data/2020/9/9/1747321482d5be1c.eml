Josh,

Thank you for contacting (mt) Media Temple.

You may use the shared SSL certificate that is included with your Grid, covering *.gridserver.com, for email purposes at no additional charge. If you wish to have an SSL certificate for your website, or a subdomain, you can order a Wildcard SSL certificate from us and use our automated installer, or you can order one from a third-party and install it manually. For detailed instructions on how to do so, please follow the directions outlined in the following article:
