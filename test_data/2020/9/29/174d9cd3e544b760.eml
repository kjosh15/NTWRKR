Everyone I know is trying to figure out how to build worthwhile =
relationships in the pandemic. But with virtualization, 99% of everything =
is turning out to be spam.
=20
I figured I'd try something different. We've=
 worked together before, and more importantly you're someone I *enjoyed* =
working with, and would work with again. Below is a shortlist of my current=
 projects; reply with an update on your current projects, or schedule a =
time(https://josh.is/scheduling) and let's chat!=20
Looking forward to reconnecting,
Josh
