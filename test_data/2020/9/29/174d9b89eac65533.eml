Congrats on the unit purchase, and apologies on the mistaked email - I'm
trying to qualify who out of everyone I've communicated with in the last
decade is doing interesting work and is worth building a relationship with.
Turns out there's lots of cool stuff going on, but the signal to noise
ratio now that everything is virtualized is crap!

Unfortunately IMAX Labs is no more, so I can't help you there. Would be
curious what you're up to now that's put you in a position to help out with
it, though; do you have a site/reference I could look at?

All best,
Josh
