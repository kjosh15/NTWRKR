Thanks for the great session just now - I was SUPER inspired by your points
about all the positive change that can be created by intentionally crafting
remote work.

A bit part of the reason for this is that I've built a SaaS platform that
uses peer-to-peer evaluations to create statistical models of behavior and
belief, and since COVID interest has been exploding. What I feel like we're
missing most is a sense of intentionality that we can pass on to our
customers, most of whom recognize that good data on their employees is not
only beneficial to the employees themselves, but also to the management
team who can use it to make better teams, groups, and ultimately companies.

Do you have time for a brief call to discuss and see if / how we could help
each other? For my part I'd like to know more about your service offering
if nothing else as it's a recommendation request we get from clients often.

All best,
Josh
