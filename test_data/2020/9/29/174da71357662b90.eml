Hey Josh,

Sorry, I did get this email and I even already made the DNS changes, it 
just takes longer to compose a meaningful email (the curse of being an 
introvert).  AXFR shouldn't be a problem for small domains, though there 
might be an issue with a slave relying on AXFR.  I'll take a look at it.

I would like to catch up some time, but I don't know when :/ with a 
~1-year-old and remote kindergarten it's nearly impossible to do 
anything synchronous (some time exists, it's just very fragmented).

The US is crazy these days.  I live across the river from a federal 
courthouse where a small number of people gather every night to pound on 
the walls with crow bars, as if they can take down the government one 
brick at a time; and depending on what news channel you watch, this is 
either glossed over as "continuing protests" in an article about 
something else, or reported as "the city of Portland has been roiled by 
violent rioting for six months".  If you read a Facebook feed that 
contains both fans of the far left and the far right, you'll have a 
pretty good idea, not of what's really happening, but of what everyone 
is seeing.  I had better stop writing about this, it is super frustrating.

I wouldn't normally think to write about the weather, but a week or two 
ago wildfires in central Oregon and central Washington brought us smoky 
air and an AQI of 500 (100 is considered the healthy limit).  You could 
see only about two blocks, and every once in a while a thicker cloud 
would blow past.  Then we got rain and favorable wind, and the AQI 
dropped to single digits.

I have to imagine that Iceland is spared most of this sort of thing :) 
how is it living there?  How are the kids adapting to living in Iceland 
after NYC?  (When did you move, anyway?)

Take care,

-Konrad
