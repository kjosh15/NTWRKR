Ideal; I think you hit most of the critical points here. Let me ping a few
contacts locally and see what they say.

Also, am churning away in the background on our AI idea - don't mistake my
radio silence!! Had a couple big issues come up last week around out apt.
in NYC that destroyed my calendar, but hope to get a more cogent reply to
you in the next few days - apologies.
