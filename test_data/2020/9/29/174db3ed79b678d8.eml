Thanks for this!! Been watching DCEP for a while now; I think this sums  it
up:

 "DCEP is built on an idea of centralised control. The value of Bitcoin
lies in its decentralisation nature and its isolation from the financial
system,"

But also the fact that the US has been sitting on its hands w/regards to
finance, AI, and quantum for a decade or more now - China may win simply by
virtue of scale and speed. If so, the question will be how hard other
nation states demand interoperability - if that=E2=80=99s non-negotiable it=
 could
easily stall global adoption.
