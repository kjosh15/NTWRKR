Michael,

Thought I would follow up on the topic we discussed yesterday around how to
change behaviours towards a corporate goal - and whether we could use video
of leaders discussing values to help with that.

I have shown that video I made to a number of leaders and their response has
been the same as yours around "that isn't the answer" - so I was wondering
if there may be an internal comms role / service that you guys could sell to
customers. 

Essentially we would be asking leaders to give 30 minutes every couple of
weeks over zoom to be interviewed about their approach to values etc . You
would supply an interviewer who would lead them through a targeted bunch of
questions around their attitude to values designed to generate the
empathetic content that we are looking for. We would then assess the impact
of each piece of content and that would inform the interviewers approach the
next week - we could give you a data dashboard that to inform that
targeting.

I realise that this would still be a difficult ask for leaders - but I come
back to the concept that if we can't get leaders talking about values then
it will be difficult to move behaviours in a given direction.

We do have a plan to change behaviours directly using AI and bypassing
leaders but it would arguably be better if it was leader driven.

Looking forward to discussing again.

Chris
