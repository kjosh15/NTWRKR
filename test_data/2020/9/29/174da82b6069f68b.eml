Excellent conversation earlier today; really enjoyed hearing your
perspective and wish you best of luck with whatever does/doesn't come in
the next couple weeks.

In the meantime, I'd love to connect to the gentleman you mentioned; I
think he was an investor? Very curious to hear his take on the community in
Germany (and investment / advising generally!)

Finally, please do let me know if I can give back at all. Would love to
help in return!

All best,
Josh
