We're moving as soon as I lock in some other contract work; juggling
IndigoMetrics' growth and moving my family to another country has chewed up
a fantastic amount of time...!

Glad the new job is offering a better balance - if there was ever a time to
focus on that, it's now. :)

All best,
Josh

Hey Josh - happy autumn :-)<br>
<br>
Wondering if there was any interest at Corning for a CISO or senior app-sec=
 person to join a Department of Commerce Software Transparency working grou=
p focused on SBOMS from third-party suppliers. The Healthcare Proof of Conc=
ept group, which includes Abbott, Medtronic, Thermo Fisher, Mayo, Cleveland=
 Clinic, NY Presbyterian and others, is already in Phase 2. There are the b=
eginnings of similar groups forming in Automotive and Energy. If Corning wa=
nted to participate or anchor a Manufacturing, the Department of Commerce w=
ould certainly welcome that.<br>
