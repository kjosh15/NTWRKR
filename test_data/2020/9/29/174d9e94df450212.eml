Stephanie,

Did we / will we receive an Economic Impact Payment of $2,400 (as we filed
married filing jointly)? I don't recall seeing this. As per:

https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-eip=
-eligibility-and-general-information

Curious if this was inbound or something we had to chase down.

Hope you're doing well,
Josh
