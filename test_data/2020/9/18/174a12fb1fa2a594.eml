Based on our conversation I&#39;ve pulled out three main areas of work, som=
e associated deliverables, and a rough project order for purposes of discus=
sion. I close with a couple notes on structure and some open questions befo=
re we formulate this into a contract.<br>

4. Use insights gathered above to create a data literacy education campaign=

<br>
<b># Structure:</b><br>
<br>
I suggested we start with 1/2 time because I believe there is significant i=
mmediate impact to be made around workforce agility, data, and considered t=
echnological leapfrogging. If we structure this as a retainer or per diem (=
plus expenses such as travel) we
 can throttle/accelerate as needed. To that end I usually build in a review=
 period quarterly to allow for adjustment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b># Questions:</b><u></u><u></u></p>
<blockquote style=3D"margin-left:30pt;margin-right:0in">
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">A) Are the above areas correct for where you think I=
 could produce the biggest impact, and do they align with your immediate ne=
eds?<br>
B) Does the project order above look correct?<br>
C) Are there any other longer-term goals or deliverables that the above wor=
k should consider?<span style=3D"color:blue"> =E2=80=93 understand HR Visio=
n, HR Transformation, HR Strategic initiatives and 3 year roadmap; Takeda P=
eople Pillar aspiration (people strat will
 be built later =E2=80=93 need to approach it the Takeda way).<u></u><u></u=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><br>
Tell me where/if the above needs adjustment and I&#39;ll revert ASAP before=
 conferring with Ellie at Korn Ferry!<br>
