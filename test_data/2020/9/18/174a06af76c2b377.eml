"1 in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward
California, the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years
because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely
to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It
will accelerate rapid, perhaps chaotic, urbanization of cities ill-equipped
for the burden, testing their capacity to provide basic services and
amplifying existing inequities. It will eat away at prosperity, dealing
repeated economic blows to coastal, rural and Southern regions, which could
in turn push entire communities to the brink of collapse."

and

"A Dust Bowl event will most likely happen again. The Great Plains states
today provide nearly half of the nation=E2=80=99s wheat, sorghum and cattle=
 and
much of its corn; the farmers and ranchers there export that food to
Africa, South America and Asia. Crop yields, though, will drop sharply with
every degree of warming. By 2050, researchers at the University of Chicago
and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
<https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants2016193> found, Dust Bowl-era
yields will be the norm, even as demand for scarce water jumps by as much
as 20%."

and

"the U.S. economy over all could contract by 10%."

and

"heat alone will cause as many as 80 additional deaths per 100,000 people =
=E2=80=94
the nation=E2=80=99s opioid crisis, by comparison, produces 15 additional d=
eaths
per 100,000. The most affected people, meanwhile, will pay 20% more for
energy, and their crops will yield half as much food or in some cases
virtually none at all. That collective burden will drag down regional
incomes by roughly 10%, amounting to one of the largest transfers of wealth
in American history,"

Fuck! Investing in property in Iceland is starting to look downright
sensible...
