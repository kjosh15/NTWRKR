All good - interesting times, and all that!

Things here are good. Settling the kids into school here in Iceland +
remote to NYC, exploring the EU markets, and setting up for some
interesting contract work over my usual advising. Again, interesting times.

Good to hear about going to market. Let me know when works for you morning
your time next week; later in the week is looking better for me.

All best,
Josh
