Hi Josh, sorry. We need to know which microcontroller this person is using.
Arduino Genuino, Arduino clone, or some other compatible microcontroller.
This could affect the interrupts and/or the availability of built in pull
up resistor functionality. Before any troubleshooting can begin we need
this info.

 when one of the switches was pushed, but when the other was pushed it woul=
d not wait before closing but would instead wait just a second or two befor=
e closing halfway, opening again, and then waiting another second or two be=
fore doing the normal incremental close. The next time around, it did the s=
ame thing, with only the other switch (seemed to be the second one pushed e=
ither way?)</div><div><br></div><div>Stage 3 and stage 4 saw this weird beh=
avior again of starting to close up again right away after a coin was passe=
d through, then opening again, then normal incremental close. And in the 20=
 minutes I&#39;ve sat here mulling, it&#39;s just now decided to open and c=
lose on its own while sitting at stage 3.</div><div><br></div><div>So I had=
 been suspecting something wrong with the switches, but the fact that it&#3=
9;s doing the same thing in stage 3/4 when the switches have no effect seem=
s like it points to something else. Servo? Arduino? Something not quite rig=
ht with the wiring? This is my first project of this sort so I&#39;m not su=
re how to troubleshoot. Though I do note that my servo seems to take quite =
a while of whirring to itself when it&#39;s booting and getting parked afte=
r I power on or hit the reset, about twice as long as it seems to take in t=
he videos.</div><div><br></div><div>If anyone has seen this before and can =
point me in the right direction, I would be grateful!</div><div><br></div><=
