Chris,

Didn't have edit permissions, but would suggest we use:

A) Group Case Study 1 - nurturing talent no matter what it looks like

This one is in the deck now, but is lacking #'s to validate. Do we have
these somewhere/can we make them up, specifically for the
individual/managerial/leadership outcomes?

B) Group Case Study 2 - Culture transformation project

Has some good numbers. Would need to draw out individual and managerial
impact; do you have any suggestions on this front?

C) Case Study A - FCA Regulated Broker Dealer

This also had some good numbers, and can serve as the "stick" example of
what companies really want to avoid. Would also need to pull out individual
an managerial impact examples/numbers.

For reference, core material is here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9TPvFvshaY-peXns8z4JDjLghdNwJY10WeTfav=
5wfM/edit?ts=3D5f5750ee

Excited to be moving things forward...
